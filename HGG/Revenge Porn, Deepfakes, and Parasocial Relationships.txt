if you're someone who is like oh no this shouldn't be a problem I don't understand why people are complaining you think about a single time in your life and hopefully for the sake of learning this has happened to you where someone was talking crap about you and other people were hearing it and how did that make you feel and now you amplify it literally by ten thousand or one hundred thousand because that's what happens in scenarios like this so sometimes on the internet there's drama and when there's drama we actually try really hard to steer clear of it a big part of what we do here at healthy gamer is not talk about people one of our Central principles is that we think you should talk to people and half the problem with the internet right now is that everyone opines everyone has opinion everyone says what other people should and shouldn't be doing we try really hard to step away from that and actually like talk to the people who are involved to hear their experience of things this is something that I learned to Value originally when I was in India absolutely learned to Value it ten times over as a psychiatrist that you actually need to talk to people and listen to people about what their experience of a particular thing is the reason that we're talking about today about non-consensual pornography deep fakes revenge porn and all that kind of stuff is because there's a lot of science actually out there which very few people know the reason that we're choosing to open our mouths today is because I think a lot of people really need to understand what impact this has because we've heard a lot of people say hey this is harmful to me and we've also heard a lot of people say it shouldn't be right you didn't actually participate in it you don't have to watch it we hear all these kinds of statements so I'm going to start off by sharing a little bit about the research so the first thing is that if you look at the research on this kind of stuff there's actually a research term called non-consensual pornography and why do they call it that it's because kind of like revenge porn falls under that but it's basically what are the psychological impacts of pornography that is doesn't have the consent of the people involved so there's one study that shows that after non-consensual pornography is released over half of the people who are involved want to kill themselves that's crazy so for the record ninety percent of people who are in non-consensual pornography are women 10 Are Men about and this is like a one-time thing that leads to suicidal ideation and over 50 percent of people in addition to all kinds of crap around PTSD anxiety depression all that stuff gets worse but there are very few things I've seen as a psychiatrist that a single event causes someone to go from zero percent suicidality all the way to suicidal ideation and this is a common experience right so this happens in over 50 percent of people who have non-consensual pornography made about them or released about them so the first thing is that if you're thinking oh this isn't that bad actually the data suggests it is and here's the other reason why I want you all to really take a step back and think about this because when it comes to stuff like deep fakes you can have an opinion I can have an opinion research on the negative impacts of deep fakes we're not really sure when that'll come out we actually have a lot about non-consensual pornography which is what's really cool is it like talks about non-consensual pornography but the truth is you don't actually know you have no idea what the psychological impact is like for the person who's actually the victim we don't have really anything in the history of humanity that sort of has allowed the human brain to experience this kind of thing so like 10 000 years ago when people were making cave art if I wanted to draw a nudie picture about someone in the colony like it's cave art that who knows what psychological impact that has deep take for fake pornography is completely different so I'm going to give you all an example of I was trying to think about how could someone who has not been the victim of a deep fake understand what the psychological impact of a deep fake is and so I was just trying to think about what can I do and here's the best that I could come up with and it's probably terrible so imagine for a moment that you were given GHB Rohypnol or the date right date rape drug or some kind of other dissociative or Amnesia inducing agent so you have no recollection of it and then you engage in a sexual act that you have no recollection of someone films it and then you watch it the next day what do you think would be the psychological impact on you if you saw yourself engaging in a sexual act that you have no memory of something about this example I hope makes you feel icky I want to say that if you're someone who said oh deep fake pornography is not a problem when I share this because this is what this is the closest way that I can imagine to try to equate deep fake pornography to like an actual experience because this is a what does it do to the human mind to see yourself having sex with someone that you never agreed to have sex with I have no idea and neither do you the experts in this are actually the victims because they're the ones whose brains are actually seeing this stuff they're the ones who are feeling these feelings and the research suggests it's actually pretty [ __ ] bad so another thing that I want to talk about is people talk about you know consent and so here's my take I'm not an extrovert in legal stuff I'm not an expert in politics but generally speaking it's my understanding that as human beings we own our likeness right you can't take my face and plaster it on an advertisement for I don't know Peanut Butter Cups right as a human being I own my likeness I own my voice I am entitled to me no one else is entitled to me and especially when it comes to things like streamers and stuff for celebrities we sort of know that right because like people will pay for your likeness so when we talk about something like deep fake pornography what we are doing is stealing someone's identity we're taking their likeness and we're saying hey I'm going to use it for something and you don't get a say in that I'm pretty sure that's consistently wrong I'm pretty sure that is aligned with our views as human beings of what is okay and not okay and generally speaking as a society we say it's not okay to use someone's likeness without their consent the next thing that I want to talk a little bit about is the responses to people who have been through kind of a deep fake and a lot of people will say like oh you don't have to watch it or it's not that bad or we'll also hear this which is like it comes with the territory and that's also something that really bothers me because frankly it doesn't come with the territory what comes with the territory is what you sign up for so if there's pornographic content about you on the internet and you are an only Fan's Creator who makes pornographic content that comes with the territory streaming on Twitch being a YouTube personality being a celebrity that does not equate that does not entitle people to make pornography about the said person this is the whole point right as human beings we have free will we get to choose what we participate in and we don't sign ourselves up for all kinds of random crap just because we choose to do one thing so I don't buy for a second that when you were a streamer you're signing yourself up and you are giving people license to use your likeness for pornographic means I just don't buy that I think that's like fundamentally like foolish and wrong and is not consistent with how we behave as as a society we just don't do that man I don't think that any amount of privilege or money or likes or fame or whatever like excuses people violating your rights like just because I'm rich which I'm not really but you know just because someone is Rich does not entitle you to steal from them like I just don't think that that's fair like that's not how we work the next thing that I want to talk a little bit about and this is going to sound kind of weird but it really bothers me and scares me how little Compassion or empathy there is for the people who are the first set of victims here and we'll get to what I mean by that so when someone is like telling you hey this hurts me and you say it shouldn't and a lot of times the people who are saying it shouldn't or you deserve it or it comes with the territory oftentimes those are men I don't think men are evil I think men are fantastic human beings and yet when when I hear men predominantly say things like this it really bothers me for a couple of reasons that maybe you haven't heard yet the first is that when we're talking about the damage caused by Deep fakes there are absolutely victims who are people like streamers or whatever revenge porn non-consensual pornography like it doesn't have to be a streamer those per people are absolutely victims but I'm actually worried about the people who are consuming deep fake pornography I am concerned for their health and well-being and I think a lot of the problems that those people face deep fake pornography is not helping so let me just give you all an example okay just let me just think out loud about this so right now if you're a man and you're alone there's something really special about content creators and relationships with content creators there's this thing called the parasocial relationship and I think the internet has kind of stumbled into this with influencers where we have these parts of our brain that make us feel connected to other human beings and if we look at what makes us feel connected to another human being it's all kinds of stuff so one thing that makes us connected to another human being is hugging another human being when we hog or when we cuddle after sex we get this a release of this hormone called oxytocin in our brain an oxytocin helps form emotional bonds oxytocin anytime oxytocin is floating around we bond with whatever is nearby so it's really interesting but when a newborn is breastfeeding the the signal that triggers the release of breast milk is actually oxytocin so this hormone facilitates mother child bonding it facilitates emotional bonding after sex which quick side note if you're trying to be friends with benefits and you don't want to catch feelings don't cuddle after because that's when the oxytocin kicks in so this is one way in which we Bond but there are other ways in which we bond that have nothing to do with physical touch so when we see someone be genuine when we see someone be vulnerable when we see someone who has the ups and downs of their day that helps us form emotional bonds with them when someone interacts with us we form emotional bonds with them there's a community of people out there who are forming bonds with influencers this is one of the outcomes of the internet and why is it it's because celebrities in the past didn't interact with you right you saw only certain slices very curated slices of a celebrity's life you see them in the movies you see them on certain like media interviews but you don't get to see the day-to-day moments of life how do you feel connected to another human being you feel connected when you see the day-to-day moments of their life you see them crying you see them happy you see them sad you see them bored they resonate with you and we start to form this Bond and what we're seeing is that parasocial relationships are damaging not just to the streamer but to the person on the other end because when I start to form this false bond with someone else I can never get what a real Bond should get me right that person is never they're never going to listen to my vulnerabilities and shortcomings the way that I'm going to listen to bears there's never going to be hugging there's never going to be cuddling there's never going to be holding hands there's never going to be going to dinner together and as I sort of almost become addicted to this parasocial relationship it becomes harder for me to engage in real life and this becomes a vicious cycle because the harder it is for me to become become engaged in real life and this is what we're seeing is there a lot of lonely men out there who are forming parasocial relationships lonely women as well the harder it becomes for me to engage in real life the more dependent I become on this a parasocial relationship to fit my emotional needs and this is crushing a generation of people because I'm getting so addicted to this zombie relationship it's a half relationship it's not a real relationship but it's all I've got and I can't give it up I've seen parasocial relationships destroy marriages I've seen parasocial relationships lead to in seldom I've seen all kinds of negative impacts and the Deep fake porn makes this worse because now what we've managed to do is check one more box in the parasocial relationship not only do I I understand this person I know this person I've seen them at their highs I've seen them at their lows I've been there for them they've talked to me and now I can get some kind of sexual gratification in a sensory manner relating to this person and I think this is going to make the parasocial relationship worse so I'm really concerned for the people who are actually consuming this content I'm not saying that they're good people or anything like that but I think it's important to acknowledge that and I'm not going to use the word victim but I think that they are damaging themselves too this almost feels to me like a situation of like being a smoker and secondhand smoke sure it's bad for the streamer involved but it's actually damaging for the person who's doing this kind of stuff and if you're someone who watches deep fake pornography or has these parasocial relationships I want you to really like stop and think a little bit about what is this doing to you what is this doing to your life and because what I what I'm hearing is so much like victim blaming and like oh it's not their fault they should have thick skin like but think about yourself for a second does advocating for deep fake pornography or watching deep fake pornography what does that do for your life I can't imagine that because you're watching deep fake porno you're like life is full of like fun and games and things like that what it's actually doing is like taking advantage of a very very core psychological need which by the way is why it's so [ __ ] paywalled because people are desperate and they're willing to pay for it why are people willing to pay for it because it's so much more damn addicting than regular pornography why is it so much more damn addicting than regular pornography because there's all of this other psychological relationship parasocial crap involved so you all need to be careful from the person who's in the Deep fake porn this is kind of a situation where I don't know if this is a good analogy or not sure so this is like people are consuming or like the smokers but the people who are the victims and the porn are getting the second hand smoke from every single smoker out there so it's like secondhand smoke isn't that bad but when there's 10 000 people who are all blowing their secondhand smoke in your face all at once that is devastating that is what leads 50 plus percent of people to suicidal ideation after unconsensual pornography is released so this is like psychologically incredibly traumatic and I don't think people quite realize this is something that we haven't really understood until we started working with tons of streamers is that the human brain is not designed to deal with vitriol and hatred from like a hundred thousand people that's just not what we're made for we're made to like deal with like 150 to 300 people and when we scale things on the level of the internet one person watching deep fake porno may not be that bad but when it becomes five thousand ten thousand twenty thousand people all of that starts to weigh on the person involved and this is exactly why non-consensual pornography is so bad because this is a case of even if you're not famous it's stuff that's being spread or about you right and if you're someone who is like oh no this shouldn't be a problem I don't understand why people are complaining you think about a single time in your life and hopefully for the sake of learning this has happened to you where someone was talking crap about you and other people were hearing it and how did that make you feel and now you amplify it literally by ten thousand or one hundred thousand because that's what happens in scenarios like this when people Dogpile a streamer this is what the experience is like the amount of hatred is just so high there's one other thing that I want to talk about which is the problem with the lack of compassion for people who are victims so there are a lot of people out there who are saying hey like people signed up for this you all deserve it it's not that bad and in that moment if you're a dude which I'm assuming that most people who are saying this kind of stuff are dudes and my apologies if that's not fair in that moment you are demonstrating a complete lack of compassion and empathy for another human being and chances are the reason that you feel that way is because people have treated you that way right so if we look at people like who are like in cells or like lonely coomers on the internet like a lot of y'all honestly are struggling we know this because these are the people in our community they come to our community they say help us get better and we do that right we do our level best our subreddit was an absolute mess for some amount of time because these people were coming in and a lot of people were like ban these people we did not ban those people did we delete comments sure did we sometimes ban people for violating rules sure but we violated that we banned people for violating rules that we had set out it wasn't discrimination against these people and by the way if there's a set of rules and you come and you break those rules and you get banned that's not censorship or discrimination that's you broke the rules so we're not gonna let you play the game but going back to like what really bothers me about this or I think what we need to acknowledge is I want you to like look at where your lack of compassion is coming from why is it that when someone says hey this hurts a lot this is what pain looks like this is devastating for me why is it that you can't hear what they're saying because chances are you have probably experienced the exact same thing that that person is experiencing because I would bet money that if you are an [ __ ] towards people who are victims of non-consensual pornography there have been times in your life where you told someone else hey I am really suffering and everyone ignored you what did people tell you especially if you're a man you don't deserve to suffer what are you complaining about it comes with the [ __ ] territory because this is what we tell men who suffer you're privileged right and so what happens to us we hear this stuff we reach out for help we say hey I'm hurting and the World Turns to us and says screw you you should be able to handle it comes with the territory and we become so resentful that when another human being gets hurt we take all that resentment and we dump it on them hurt people hurt people right the world has treated us like [ __ ] so we're going to turn around and treat other people like [ __ ] I want you to really think about whether this applies to you or not because this sounds really bizarre but y'all are the people that should actually be the most understanding of the victims in this scenario because you're the one who's actually been there when you've been hurting and not a single person listened everyone said you shouldn't be feeling pain what the [ __ ] are you complaining about y'all should be the ones at the front of the line supporting these people because you know what it's like to have the entire world against you and when I see this level of resentment and vitriol towards people who are clearly hurting there's really only one explanation in my mind that rises to the surface which is that you've been there and no one was there for you so you're so freaking resentful that you're gonna pay it forward and so I'd strongly encourage you to think a little bit about this and think about where the resentment is coming from why are you so willing to discount other people's experience of pain because that's what you were taught and to be blunt this is the kind of thing that becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy so if you're a dude who's lonely has a parasocial relationship can't find a girlfriend who's been rejected over and over and over again what do you think is responsible for that I know a lot of y'all want to blame feminism and I'm not saying women are perfect but an attitude that completely lacks compassion and is devoid of empathy is the [ __ ] reason you can't get laid that's the reason just think about it for a second it's not because women are against you it's because when someone else is suffering how do you respond to that and this is what terrifies me about the world like I used to be scared of climate change and nuclear war but honestly it's stuff like this this is what's going to destroy Humanity we have somehow figured out the source code of the human brain and people who don't have your best interests at heart are capitalizing on that source code they're taking advantage of you right because like why is everyone paying for this it's because it's like so freaking addictive why is it addictive because it takes normal pornography and it adds a relationship component to it but what it's giving people is a half-life it's like a zombie relationship it's not real it's damaging you and it's damaging that person and we've got to be really careful because the rate of technological advancement we're like playing with fire and we don't even realize it we're like screwing our dopaminergic circuitry like people are struggling suicide rates continue to climb men are in crisis right now I saw a staggering study that over half of men may not be mentally ill when they kill themselves right like women don't know how to trust men and that I don't blame them for because here's the thing that you have to understand if you're a man who feels judged because a woman won't give you a chance think for a second about what must have happened in that woman's life where her brain is telling her we cannot trust men and this is what's really bizarre is men are becoming better and better at Deception and the better that men get at Deception the more adaptively mistrustful women will have to become and that can go both ways too right so when men become more emotionally manipulative which is what a lot of these like manosphere like red pill types will do they will teach men how to become emotionally manipulative and what does that do as men become better emotional manipulators and they're like training programs that you can sign up for this what women are going to have to learn how to do is become distrustful and that's what we see and then a bunch of other men are out there saying no one's ever giving me a chance and before blaming the woman start to understand why and I'm gonna I know it sounds absolutely weird because I don't know if I'm pissing everyone off or making everyone happy but I think we're all screwed in this this is something that we're doing together we're screwing ourselves this is like smoking in secondhand smoke the the real tragedy here is like are women victims absolutely but like we're the ones getting damaged as men too this is not good for anyone involved in the place that honestly I think you'll need to start is if you if you see another human being a woman suffering because I'm sort of talking about men because I think there is a gender imbalance here if you see another human being suffering in your instinctive reaction is you shouldn't feel that way I want you to look at my face you shouldn't feel that way that's what you're going to be feeling that's resentment where does that come from why can't you be capable of compassion and the same is true of women as well right if a man says hey I'm suffering my life is hard if you discount that where is that coming from that's also coming from resentment I can't believe this man is complaining he's privileged and I have been the recipient of male privilege or the disadvantages of male privilege my entire life which is where that resentment comes from in women y'all I cannot stress this enough we are screwed unless someone starts being nice to someone who doesn't deserve it we're going to keep going down this road and boy are we [ __ ] things are going to get worse mass shootings will continue sexual violence will continue at some point we're going to see a female Mass shooter mark my words that's a divide that we're getting closer and closer to Crossing we need to like help each other we need to support each other because anytime I look outside I don't see that one group of people is like yay my life is so easy everybody's getting crushed and the only way that we get through this is if we work together check your impulse before you tweet at someone who you think is a POS right no snowflake thinks it's responsible for the Avalanche and if you are someone who thinks that the world is going to hell if you're a man who thinks that feminism has destroyed the world or you're a woman who thinks that all men are evil this is what's really bizarre you are a piece of that equation right there are men out there who are hurting right now that as a woman you can demonstrate some amount of compassion as a man if some woman demonstrates compassion and you catch feelings for her that is not an excuse to violate her boundaries we both have like this is not going to work unless it's an all hands on deck kind of thing so I encourage each and every one of you to really think about your reactions and in my mind it is unequivocally wrong to to engage in depict pornography right like this is like the the data is like clear that it's quite damaging foreign
