so i i like this because you know i think this client really exemplifies like what we see what we try to accomplish how we help and also that sometimes we can't do it all and you need to see a therapist sometimes the most efficient way to get help uh to to improve is actually to just get help and i just wanted to share with you all i know there's been a lot of negative video on the subreddit recently i mean i think it's good i think it's healthy but um just wanted to share this with you all so coaching changed my life hey all i see a lot of people venting in a lot of posts which is fine and i get it and at one point i did the same but then anxiety got the better of me and i deleted it however i wanted to give a shout out to the healthy gamer coaching program and hopefully you guys a bit of hope for the future a bit about me i was a multi-college dropout desperately trying to find solutions for what seemed to be a never-ending cycle of mental problems like many of you i started watching dr k videos and a lot of the problems he discussed really resonated with me and by watching the online coaching videos it made me feel better that other people shared my problems i figured heck if i could pay for weed monthly then i could pay for the coaching program i was too scared to commit myself to an expensive therapist because a was unsure if they would be a good fit and b i knew i had a lot of talking to do so i signed up for the coaching program and lo and behold i did it bi-weekly for about a year i did it for so long i participated in in one of their long-term coaching client surveys i can give you a brief idea of what it entailed for me let me preface it by saying it is definitely not therapy what it was for me was a safe and unbiased place i could just [ __ ] vent for 50 minutes whether it was old problems or new i could vent about life and the questions my coach asked helped me dig deeper about life and myself this eventually after one year led me to realize i needed actual professional therapy i started professional therapy and initially went two weeks and now i go about every eight this all happened in a little under two years tldr i went from being addicted to video games from from 8 to 18 years old lost in a spiral of substance abuse weed nick addie and could not find myself and was beginning to isolate from friends now i move states and am dealing with and processing my emotions more clearly no longer i'm addicted to weed nick or adderall i dropped all other medications as well and i'm only on lexapro i'm getting social life back and regularly hang out with groups of friends now i also now regularly attend school and work a full-time job which i was doing neither of these things a year ago just wanted to quickly write this up was meaning to after coaching ended don't really follow the community but still see some posts shout out to dr k shout out to healthy gamer and as much as i wish i could name give a name i figure it's best not to shout out to my coach that dealt me with rantings during all those sessions there is hope y'all will be there is hope you all will be okay much love i wanted to share that because i think the person really grasps a lot of what people don't understand about coaching the first thing is that it's not therapy and this person is like it helped me a lot by the way it's not therapy we also want to put together a study about what percentage of coaching clients wind up in therapy so actually one of the outcomes that we really look at or not look at but we want to look at is helping people get into mental health treatment because there's sometimes barriers and stigma and things like that so coaching and therapy are like two different things and i think this person is a prime example of you know how to do both that there are some things that you actually need a therapist for but some of these things like building good habits getting back into school getting a job socializing right and this person says they were venting but i think they were doing a lot more than that right i'm pretty sure if we ask this person's coach they would say that they're doing a lot more than venting they're really starting to understand what holds them back what is it within me that perpetuates the cycle that's how we figure out how to break out of it so i love this post because it touched on a lot of different things you know so people do have a lot of concerns about the cost of therapy because therapy is expensive and part of what we try to do is make our coaching affordable part of the other reason is because sometimes people you know will complain about the price but they'll like this person will buy weed every week right some people really can't afford it but i think a lot of people is we've seen this as well a lot of people can't afford it they just choose not to so i i like this because you know i think this client really exemplifies like what we see what we try to accomplish how we help and also that sometimes we can't do it all and you need to see a therapist and it's okay to need both for what it's worth i think this person's uh progress is probably in the minority like i don't know many people who have done as much as this person does after like you know a year of coaching and therapy like that's a lot they really put their life together which is exactly why we're here this is why we started the program it's to do this and also your mileage may vary i think this person has really put i mean this is where it's important to understand that if you come into coaching it's not going to fix you it's going to help you fix yourself and i think what this person is leaving out is all the work they put in because if you just come to coaching and you're like coach me to success and sobriety go i don't want to give up weed i don't want to do this i don't want to do this i'm not going to move i'm not going to do anything fix me that doesn't work the key thing though is that a lot of us have struggles and we don't know how to start we don't know how to untangle things we don't know how to get unstuck and coaching can help with that so if you all want to if you sign up for coaching and you want to end up like this person let me make it very clear that if you want to end up like this person you're going to have to put in the work will the coach help you 100 but they can't do this for you they can help you do it for yourself and by the way one of the primary goals of our coaching program is for people to no longer need it it's to end it equip you with the skills help you put together your life and it's really about self understanding and developing your own skill set it's not about developing dependency sometimes though it takes a while right it could take a year for those of you all but i just want you to think about that because like there are people in our community out there that are going to be smoking weed all the time multiple time college dropout no job no friends like struggling and they think like oh my god i can never put my life together this person did it in about two years sounds about right if you all have heard me talk about this before you know i'll say like 6 to 18 months to really get started you're going to start to see progress in two to three months like all of our outcome studies what we presented at the american psychiatric association for example i think was an 8 or 12 week outcome study so we started to see some changes but it really takes i mean putting together your life takes years you can get started and make good progress and start it starts to get a lot easier and feels a lot better pretty quickly you
