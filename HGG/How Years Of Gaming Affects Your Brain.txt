today we're going to talk about what years or even Decades of gaming does to your brain [Music] if you're a gamer chances are you're kind of living life on hard mode right other people are able to do things like have fun activities like playing football or soccer or basketball they're able to socialize a little bit more easily they're able to focus on academics and derive like reward and pleasure but if you're a gamer you're kind of like you don't want to do that stuff right you'd rather just stay at home and like play video games that's kind of fun and it sort of feels like life is passing you by hey y'all I want to take a moment to thank the sponsor of today's video Babble Babble is the premium language learning app worldwide and I really love it because it teaches you how to have real world conversations I recommend Babel for a couple of reasons the first is that it's incredibly authentic it was built by language Educators so these are people who have actually had a ton of experience teaching people how to speak languages the second thing that I really love about it is that it's scientifically backed they've been able to teach people how to speak the basics of a language in a minimum of three weeks and that's certainly what I'm getting from Babel and what I love about the app is that it's incredibly accessible even if I'm like sitting around and I don't feel like wasting time on my phone I can learn about a culture or I can even play games that will help reinforce my learning for example I just recently learned how to say aprendo espanol which means I'm learning Spanish so I can use that phrase in today's video so if you're interested in giving Babble a shot I highly recommend it check out the link in the description below to get 60 off of your subscription and once again a huge thank you to Babel for keeping mental health content on the internet free being born with sort of the gamer trait feels like a really bad debuff and I know that I certainly felt that way even when I was no longer a degenerate gamer so after I got into med school and even was like training to become a psychiatrist at Harvard I would look around at my colleagues and I would see them like being able to do lots of stuff and I could do a lot but I still spent a lot of time 10 hours a week 20 hour hours a week gaming and I thought to myself what could I accomplish if I was no longer a gamer what could I actually accomplish if I wasn't lazy or if I didn't procrastinate because that's what Gamers sort of say right we sort of think to ourselves like oh my God I'm just lazy and other people are able to find like intrinsic motivation but I can't find intrinsic motivation and I lack discipline and I don't care so much about the external world and so you sort of look at yourself and you wish that you were different and so the cool thing is that there are actually ways that you can change that and the key thing here is that it's actually you're not lazy you're not born with a debuff it's actually that games will affect your brain in ways that we don't really understand so the first thing we're going to dive into is dopamine and serotonin and we have to have a more sophisticated understanding of these neurotransmitters so dopamine is a neurotransmitter that governs reward pleasure and behavioral reinforcement the the key thing about dopamine is it tends to be triggered by things that are external so if I use a drug for example that is something that I'm ingesting it comes from the outside and it triggers this dopamine release video games will trigger dopamine release and basically anything external that is fun or pleasurable will trigger a dopamine release and anything that's fun or pleasurable will also reinforce that behavior so when we play a video game and we have fun it triggers a dopamine release which is why we're having fun and then we reinforce the behavior so we want to play again serotonin is a little bit different what serotonin really governs is an internal sense of well-being and gives us things like confidence so if we look at Gamers we engage in activities that give us lots of dopamine but don't actually give us much or any serotonin at all and so that's what creates this sort of picture of like okay I'm capable of having fun but I don't feel good I don't like feel good in my own skin I don't feel con confident I can't step away from the game and so this balance or imbalance of dopamine and serotonin is responsible for why Gamers sort of feel stuck to the screen and can't go out and sort of move in the real world because moving in the real world requires you to be confident about yourself but if you're a gamer chances are when you leave the safety of your computer or your console in these four walls you're filled with uncertainty and a lack of confidence and then you kind of retreat from that right because that's painful and it's difficult and it's confusing and you kind of come back and then you kind of think to yourself oh my God like why am I so lazy why am I so pathetic and you start to think all of these things the weird thing about Gamers is that they develop a dopaminergic dependence along with a serotonergic aversion and what do I mean by that so let's take a step back and understand how these two neurotransmitters normally function with like a regular human being so when I was like trying to become less generate I started going white water rafting a lot and I loved it so here's sort of the sequence of white water rafting when you first go rafting it's really really challenging but it's full of like adrenaline right because you're like paddling really hard it's really Rocky you're like flipping around and it's like you're getting wet and it's cold and it's like really awesome adrenaline kind of experience and you're kind of fighting for your life so it's highly dopaminergic but the key thing is that after you're done white water rafting the next day you're completely destroyed every muscle in your body is sore you're kind of like you can't do a whole lot but you feel amazing even though technically your body is in pain you sort of bask in the feeling of like I faced the river and I survived and I conquered it and you feel really really good about yourself it's not pleasure the next day you're not getting like activated you're not laughing or anything like that but you get this sense of like well-being and contentment and sort of like this other kind of Triumph and we sort of look at other other parts of life you know if you look at sort of like studying for a test or an exam you study really hard it's really painful and originally you get like this reward of hopefully getting an A or a good grade but then there's this period afterward maybe when you graduate that you sort of bask in this accomplishment and basking in that accomplishment is what causes serotonin to increase and so if we look at Gamers they don't get to do that right because I still remember when I was like climbing the Warcraft 3 ladder and I made it to spot 83 it was the highest I was number 83 on the ladder in the United States and I can't bask in that accomplishment like I can't go to people and like No One's Gonna have like a graduation party of congrats Dr K you made it to the top 100 of the latter like each of those games felt really good but I don't actually feel good about myself afterward so what we see in Gamers is that they have a dopaminergic dependence I.E you have to do things that are dopaminergic because you're easily bored right and things are hard and then those activity these that are actually serotonergic are things that you are aversive to so serotonergic activities are things that can be challenging but lead to a sense of contentment not necessarily pleasure so these are things that require a little bit more investment can be difficult and don't necessarily have a really good reward at the end it's not like you get a huge Prize or a rush of dopamine you just sort of feel good about yourself and if you're a gamer chances are there are things that you could do that would help you feel good about yourself you think to yourself well if I did this I'd feel better about myself but anytime you try to actually go and do those things it's really really hard and that's where that serotonergic aversion actually comes in because we're actually averse to doing those kinds of activities and so if you're a gamer in order to overcome that serotonergic aversion we need to start engaging in serotonergic activities so these are activities that are not pleasurable can be somewhat difficult but help you feel good about yourself or accomplished when you're done now this is what's really tricky is finding the right balance of this because frequently these two these activities are like really really hard to do so you can't like go out and like go to a party or go hiking with a group of people or things like that so when I was working with one particular gamer we came up with a really good idea which is this person was interested in free diving they wanted to like dive without scuba gear and so we kind of came up with a five minute or 10 minute stretch of walking where they would hold their breath as long as they could not not passing out or anything like that so don't do anything dangerous but they would start by holding their breath while walking that's the only thing they did so on the first day they could hold their breath for 30 seconds and then on the next day they can hold their breath for 40 seconds and 50 seconds and over the course of like two weeks three weeks all they had to do was go for a five minute walk a 10 minute walk and you can do that and they were holding their breath and over time they could hold their breath for five minutes six minutes seven minutes they would go for half hour walks hour long walks where they're holding their breath for eight minutes nine minutes at a time right so they're taking 10 15 20 breaths where they're holding it and so this is a great example of an activity that is like kind of hard it's not something that you can really brag about but as you make progress you will feel good about yourself so try to find something that is challenging to do kind of accessible to do you don't want to like tack on too much but isn't actually fun but makes you feel good about yourself so you can do something as simple as go for a walk and hold your breath the second problem we're going to deal with is how gaming interacts with your negative emotions when we play video games it actually suppresses our negative emotional circuitry so anything that is addictive one of the reasons it becomes addictive is not just because of dopamine it's not because of just the pleasure it gives us but because of what it takes away so we have this part of the brain called the amygdala and the amygdala is our survival center of the brain but it's also the part of our brain that governs our negative emotion so it makes us feel fear anxiety panic and things like that so the first thing that's really interesting is that the amygdala becomes hyper reactive when we are in low serotonin States so the lower our serotonin is the more hyperactive or jittery our amygdala is and if we're doing a lot of gaming where we're getting dopamine without serotonin the first thing we have to understand is it's priming our amygdala to be hypersensitive so Gamers will literally experience fear or anxiety or Panic or the sense of dread and uncertainty more rapidly and more intensely than the average person and this is why in Psychiatry if we have people who have panic attacks which oftentimes will start in the amygdala the treatment that we give them is actually serotonergic medications ssris there's also evidence that people who have been traumatized and are hyper Vigilant and kind of paranoid that serotonin can help them in some ways too so this is what's really tricky is we have this hyper react active amygdala and why do we have a hyper-reactive amygdala it may be because of Serotonin but there's another layer at play here so if I'm going through life and I'm feeling fear if I'm feeling anxious if I'm feeling dread about the future my brain wants to make those things go away and in the past we would have to make those things go away by fixing a problem right so if I'm like feeling lonely and I existed as a human being 5 000 years ago I couldn't magically make that loneliness go away I would have to engage with other people to sort of like no longer feel lonely now the problem is with video games we can make that emotion of loneliness go away we can make our anxiety go away we can make our fear go away and you may say to yourself but Dr K like that can sort of be a good thing right there's one crucial thing that happens when we shut off our negative emotional circuitry which is that we stop learning so if you're a gamer chances are you're going through life with an ex P penalty so if you look around at the people in your like General vicinity right they seem to be making progress in life people finish college they get jobs they get married they have kids they get promoted they go on vacation and for a lot of Gamers we kind of get stuck right we're sort of like in our 20s we're not quite making as much progress we're making some progress but everything feels harder progressing through life feels really difficult and it turns out that video games are actually responsible for this in the way that they affect your brain and this comes down to how video games impact your ability to learn from your mistakes so when I was in college like I would procrastinate and play video games and then like I'd have a test and then the day before the test I'd sort of enter this last minute Panic stage of studying and I'd study study study and I'd pass the test and then I'd be filled with regret I'd be like man like if I could could have started a day earlier or three days earlier if I had started four days earlier five days earlier I could get an A and so I I should learn my lesson at that point but I never did the next test would roll around I'd wait till the last minute I'd procrastinate and I'd end up getting maybe a b maybe a c and if I knew if I just worked a little bit harder I could do so much better and that's what the experience of a lot of Gamers is like in life that y'all work really hard for brief periods of time and then you do okay but if it weren't for this problem of gaming then you would do so much better and so what's going on in our brain and how can we fix this it turns out that the reason that Gamers progress more slowly is because they actually have an XP penalty and what do I mean from that it means that they're learning circuitry is actually impaired so our learning circuitry or the learning part of our brain is called our hippocampus which is kind of seated right next to the amygdala so the hippocampus is what governs learning and memory and the key thing about how our brains learn is the most primary motivator for Learning and changing behavior is actually negative emotion so if you go to a restaurant like five times and you like eating there the food is delicious but the sixth time you go if you get food poisoning you're never going to go to the restaurant again and so if we sort of think about how did you learn that lesson through pain and suffering I've also worked with a ton of people who have struggled with infidelity and marriage and once that trust is broken you can be married to someone for 10 years 15 years you can trust them a lot but all it takes is one instance of infidelity for you to learn your lesson and in some cases this can be so traumatic that people struggle to trust for the rest of their lives so that's really powerful learning going on and it's governed by negative emotional circuitry so what do video games do video games shut off our negative emotional circuitry so any addictive substance does two things it brings pleasure and it takes away pain and what video games essentially do is shut off blood flow to places like our amygdala where we fear feel fear and panic and anxiety and since we're are shutting off our negative emotions every time we play a video game which is why we play them right because after you were done with that test and you were like man I really need to start studying earlier what did you end up doing for the rest of the day you gamed and the moment that you game you shut off that negative emotional circuitry and you hamper your learning and start to develop that XP penalty so what can we do about this essentially the first place to start is to actually be able to sit with negative emotions we don't need to conquer them we don't need to fix them we don't need to process them they're going to do the work on their own we just have to not numb them out so what I strongly recommend to Gamers who feel like you've got an XP penalty if you're not just making progress what you need to do is spend some time sitting with your emotions now Gamers May Wonder well how can I do that there's one really simple exercise you can do is if you've been bearing your emotions for years because you gained too much they're floating right beneath the surface so all you need to do is give them a neutral space so the next time you're feeling negative emotion don't reach for any kind of advice or anything like that just sit somewhere or Pace for like five to fifteen minutes the other thing that you can do is just stare at a wall so like this is a practice that I've given people it's been transformative and revolutionary stare at a wall for 20 minutes up to an hour and what's going to happen is as you stare at the wall like you're gonna start by feeling bored your mind is going to wander and then you'll start to notice like negative emotions come up frustration feeling like I'm being inefficient I'm wasting time I don't like this those are actually all negative motions and all you need to do you don't need to fix them you just need to be able to feel them and be able to tolerate them because the moment that you're able to tolerate them you don't have to retreat into the video game if you don't retreat into the video game the emotional activity in the brain will be restored if the emotional activity in the brain is restored it will start working on your negative emotional circuitry so I want you all to think about why we have emotions for a second we'll really understand this point it's like 5 000 years ago if a human being experienced a negative emotion like feeling lonely what could they do to make that emotion go away that negative emotion would prompt them to engage with other human beings in the same way that hunger prompts me to eat that's negative right makes me feel bad thirst prompts me to drink loneliness prompts me to reach out to other people that's why we have negative emotions because they prompt us towards the most important behaviors nowadays we have a very serious problem because when we play a video game we can make the loneliness go away for a little bit but it doesn't actually fix any of our problems so we don't actually progress or improve in our life at all so we're taking away that negative emotional energy leading ourselves to literally not learn that XP penalty and also not progress in life the third thing that video games do that really hamper our progress in life is they do all of the operationalization for us now I gotta explain what that means so when you play a video game everything is laid out there's a main quest there is a side quest there's a mini map all the rules are laid out you can open up like you know the encyclopedia which gives you the mechanics of the game everything is laid out for you and for the stuff that isn't laid out in the game there's a thousand different websites or YouTube tutorials or whatever that they can show you where to stand and what to click and optimizing DPS rotations all the rules of Life are laid out in a video game and what you should do from start to finish someone is holding your hand real life does not work like that so what I found when I work with Gamers is they have a very particular deficit which is that they cannot operationalize prop problems what that means is that Gamers can't take an abstract task like become financially independent and break it down into pieces why can't they do that it's because games have been doing this crap for you for so long that literally the circuits in your brain that do this start to atrophy and wither so if your brain doesn't use a particular functionality it starts to wither this is why we forget languages we forget skills we forget stories anything that we don't continually engage with and lose just like any muscle in our body we start to become deconditioned and so what Gamers really struggle with is like moving forward in life because they don't know how to take these like big things that you're supposed to be doing like be happy well how do you do that I don't know how to do that be financially independent be successful find a romantic relationship and it's like you don't you're like where where's the quest marker for that like I'm confused like anytime I go to a party and I hang out with people I don't see an excellent animation point in someone that I'm attracted to that I can walk up and then I right click them and then I'm like okay is my reputation high enough like do I need to gift this thing to make them like me and that's what [ __ ] Gamers do right they're like how do I like what's the rules to this game where I can get this person to to do how do I succeed how do I fulfill the quest objectives and so what they end up doing is they think like oh like I procrastinate because they don't get started but it's not like the reason they don't get started is because they procrastinate it's because the reason they don't get started is because they don't know how to get started because for a decade there's been a computer that's telling you exactly what to do for like six hours a day and so your brain is like I don't know how to do that so what we really need to help Gamers do and thankfully we can do stuff about this so don't panic is take that abstract task and we need to teach y'all how to operationalize how to take this Global main quest right because even if you think about a video game a main quest is really long but you don't even think think about the end at the beginning there's like there are checkpoints like there's the first part of the main quest and the second part in the third part and the fourth part so we need to use our cognitive skills to break down the main quests of life into little pieces there's a really simple exercise to do that so anything that you want to accomplish anything just whatever it is can you do it right now the answer is no okay so this is what you're good at we're going to leverage your strengths to overcome your weaknesses take that task and split it into two parts okay so let's say like I want to become financially independent so can I do that like right now the second no so what am I going to do I'm gonna break it into two parts okay what does that mean that means retire and before I retire I have to like get a job so those are the two pieces can I retire no can I get a job can I do that right this second no so then okay what does it take to get a job split that into two pieces okay so like getting a job requires like having a job like going to a job for a while and then like applying for a job or finding a job can you apply for a job within the next five minutes can you do that can you do it literally right now if the answer is no break that apart okay well why can't you apply for a job what are the two pieces of applying for a job that's going to an interview and submitting an application can you submit an application right this second if the answer is no what is that involved that involves a resume Do you have a resume right now no I don't have a resume what does that involve that involves finding a template doing some research making a list of your activities unless you can do something within five minutes and have that task done I want you to break that apart into two pieces and you keep on breaking it apart and what you're gonna end up with is a [ __ ] main quest quest line right like that's what you're going to end up with you're gonna end up with 50 000 tasks that are very very minute go talk to this person in this Village and deliver this thing and then you're gonna get some XP and then they're gonna give you the next thing and then you're gonna go and you're gonna go hunt boars for boar tails and you're gonna take those bortells and you're gonna take them to the Alchemist you got to do that for your own life because your brain literally does not know how to automatically do that so if you've been playing games for a very long time like me and especially if you started early in life it's gonna change or shape the way that your brain evolves the way that your brain evolves or the way that it kind of grows up and develops is going to lead leave you with certain deficits now the biggest mistake that Gamers make is that they assume that these deficits are baked into the character they assume that when I generated this character I picked the lazy trait and so since I picked the lazy trait I will be lazy for the rest of my life I also picked the procrastinator trait and I also picked these traits and these are things that are baked into your character but they're not they're actually Neuroscience deficits that gaming induces and if we start to reverse those Neuroscience deficits if we start to do things like operationalize our problems and go through a formal cognitive process if we start doing things like sitting with our emotions instead of retreating the video games we will start to learn better we'll remove that XP penalty and the last and arguably most important thing is really understanding the difference between dopamine and serotonin serotonin and how Gamers or dopaminergically dependent and serotonergically aversive and so what we've really got to do is start to engage in some of these activities that will are serotonin inducing in nature and so once we start to do those we will develop a sense of well-being we will develop a sense of confidence and as we develop that well-being and confidence moving out into the world is no longer like overwhelming we're gonna cleanse all those debuffs and then suddenly we're playing the game of Life on an even footing foreign
