welcome to another healthy gamer GG stream I'm figuring out how to chat with y'all so that's pretty cool uh my name is Olive kenoji just a reminder that although I'm a psychiatrist nothing we discussed on stream today is intended to be taken as medical advice everything is for educational or entertainment purposes only if you all have a concern or question please go see a licensed professional um yeah so happy Friday everybody uh we've got a couple of quick announcements and then we're gonna hop into a conversation with Jay so let's see first thing is we um have our community event that's running today running this month which is mindful Mayhem and it's a good opportunity for you all to practice mindfulness earn XP win rewards and whatnot so a couple things we've done a few um community events here at HG and and you know we like we do things like make YouTube videos and stream and all that good stuff and we teach all about mental health but at some point you all have to start doing something so some people will do stuff like um you know we've got exercises and stuff in Dr K's guide uh some people will do things like sign up for coaching I've seen a lot of stuff today because it's like um dating Friday on our subreddit and people are like you know I have difficulty socializing so group coaching and stuff like that really helps for that sort of thing helps you build emotional awareness helps you like practice communication helps you practice listening it helps you do things like uh how do you jump into a conversation when is it your turn to speak so a lot of people have this problem where they kind of like you're in a conversation but you don't know like when you're supposed to speak and you have something useful to say but then it's like that window passes and once the window passes it's like well now I don't have anything useful to say like I don't have anything good to say I had a good thing to say like I had a good joke I had to go to anecdote but like now the window is passed and I can't reverse the conversation so if you really think about it what we're seeing in society is a social skills atrophy right because we don't practice these things because we can communicate so much online and the cool thing is it's such a common thing in in group coaching where people are like when is it my turn to speak like how do I break into a conversation how do I give each other space how do I claim the space that I have or I'm supposed to have um and so you can kind of learn all those sorts of skills there and it's really fascinating because when I we hear about people dating like it sounds like people it's hard for people to talk like people don't know how to talk so we sometimes have stuff like that but the other thing that we have is our community events and so mindful Mayhem is a photo challenge where you're going to go out and you're going to do stuff chat and we're going to do things like practice box breathing make your bed right we got to start small chat burn a scented candle okay this person is just uploading all of the pictures and it's racking up all of the points brew a cup of tea or coffee make your bed nice um complete a resource pack okay complete another one make your bed okay a lot of people wait that's the same picture someone is cheating gastronaut has discovered a hack chat set three goals for the day awesome complete uh right a right thing three things you like about yourself so like this is all this stuff where eat some fruit like if we talk about being healthy right if we we're like okay we're gonna try to be healthy there's like watching YouTube videos about being healthy which we are pleased that you all do thank you so much for liking and subscribing and commenting and all that kind of stuff but then there's the actual part of being healthy which is really interesting actually for a second because there's some evidence that language can substitute for Action when it comes to progress and change which is crazy but there's there's data behind that but this is just a way to encourage you all to start doing those things that you always want to do so check out mindful Mayhem um and then last thing that we're going to talk a little bit about uh you can type exclamation point mindful in chat to join um and then last thing that we're going to talk about is we're going to introduce our epic guests today so hold on a second I gotta do this I gotta do this okay I gotta make sure that things aren't you muted okay hold on chat I'll figure this out eventually we're gonna do this then we're gonna go here and so we have the awesome Trey Dorena epic comedian um and we're gonna watch like two of his clips and then we'll hop into the interview okay yo this is so titillating watching a guy craft his bed like he's painting the sequel to The Mona Lisa all I can think is what a  waste of time he's putting hours into something that he's he's gonna fart in later he's gonna fart he might chart by accident foamy idiots yo this is so okay we measure our dicks inaccurately now hear me out okay usually we measure from base to tip and usually from the base of the bottom not the base of the top nothing but hurt feelings up there okay but that is only a measure of length where girth is arguably just as if not more important so without having to like do complex math to figure out their circumference and the diameter of a dingus like we should just be measuring dick size by volume and we simply fill up a glass full of water you put your right in it and the amount of  water the reveals placed out of the cup still is your size the more water that gets displaced the bigger your okay well this should be interesting comedy chat all right let's hop in with Che um let me do this okay I'm gonna click this button I'ma pop out this chat I'm gonna go down here and we're gonna do this and we're going to make sure that this works and it works and now we're just waiting for check so this should be interesting volumetric comparisons absolutely dude um it is oh so I think it's against both YouTube and twitch's terms of service to live stream simultaneously on both platforms it appears that Che is a man of science and it appears he's AFK GG chat so we're just gonna Vibe for a little while we're waiting oh no oh no chat um how are we all doing today let me see if

profound this is actually really profound this is wild so I have to kiss over here oh no Jay can handle it you can't handle it chat he can't handle it Discord Canon dude I swear sometimes the Internet won't let us do things if you all noticed this that like the universe like Twitches servers YouTube servers my ISP right it's Haram it makes mistake like they can't they can't handle it like we were about to you know it broke seriously like Discord was like someone's like someone's sitting there at Discord like monitoring everything and they've got the kill switch and they're like hit the kill switch all right let's see what's happening um you're just getting spinning dots okay let's troubleshoot I can't hear you but let's make sure that it's not us first of all um so let we're gonna do we're gonna do a tech support check so let me just do this first um uh input device output device okay I think that works um and then Che can you hear me I know we're sitting in the call we're going to do tech support I can't see or hear you okay click on the I'm going to screen share um hold on I gotta figure out how to do this click on the let me do this let's pop this back in and then we're going to screen share okay so now we're going to click this wait does that work yeah okay click this and then select the right camera whichever one it is and then click this okay um [Music] hmm okay bottom there should be mic icon click the mic icon and then select and then make sure that the right audio input and output are selected second thing is make sure your camera is not being pulled by something else you can select the camera icon and make sure you have the right cam um with me chat we're gonna doing doing some tech support you see the can you see my screen share we're just doing tech support now um am I a tech support wizard I'm a tech support Warlock uh either need a virtual cam or you have to start Discord first did you all know that that you have to start Discord before you start streaming sometimes depending on your camera setup oh my God you're right this is why it is not working chat oh my goodness I am not using the right I've I've equipped the wrong accent and now that the accent is equipped properly the tech support will work DM can I re-roll can I re check recheck can I recheck can I roll again can I try again with the right accent equipped or do I need to level up first did you know that normally you need to level up before you check again this is the you want to know problem in life everyone if you are interested in dating dating what you need to do is Level Up Before You recheck the problem is that right now we are checking we will ask someone out and we will fail the check no isn't it then what happens is we go and we ask again and then we fail again you must level up before you recheck otherwise the D20 role from the past will work this time isn't it Barbara jagoda is saying I love how I can't understand him that is because I am failing my communication check isn't C DC and even now I am talking and you cannot understand looks like Chase still here but we'll see you all play D 90 more head Bobble the bubble is there it is there we can't just bubble all the time otherwise you will get a repetitive stress injury RSI normal times we are talking about carpal tunnel but you can get RSI at the base of the occiput that is from the head bubble injury because these these your paraspinal muscles and the ones that insert into the back of the occiput these are the ones you have to be careful about their RSI repetitive stress injury OK we can talk to satguru but I think maybe he will be offended no can't talk to him in an accident dude oh my God a Ninja 2 saying I like other RPG systems better which RPG system is superior please let us know I've burned my finger and I can't do anything except hold an ice pack for hours you got to be careful about holding ice packs too long dude you could get an injury from that okay Chase back let's see just shared your screen wow it's not working let me see nope okay let's focus on audio and I can walk you through video if you can hear me instead of me typing order of operations you want to know one thing I learned in medical school you gotta do things in the right order you gotta do a physical exam before a CT scan right um using the right audio device we like checked this just before um I hope it's not me you can try doing a full screen share instead of um can he hear you type can y'all hear me type do you like this so so this is actually really cool I don't know if you guys um know domination time but when I first started streaming domination time was really really helpful and he actually like he has this great website that has like all of his streaming set up and he also recommended like this Kinesis gaming keyboard and the thing that I love the most about the Kinesis gaming keyboard This is not sponsored by Kinesis but I guess they should be is that I don't know if you all right but I I try to write so I write a lot right so and then what's cool about writing is um I can't hear myself when I test for some reason uh uh are your speakers on weird um yeah Tom and so so this is great actually because I can like I can move it so I you know you shouldn't write like this this little this little like my wife has this Apple keyboard and she like types like this all day because it's like this tiny little cute keyboard and so she's got this ulnar deviation at the wrist all the time and and instead what's cool is like if you're you know like a like a command command chair where your arms are like this and you can type um they're on okay you can hear other sound Like You YouTube hmm let me see uh try screen sharing if you don't mind Chad position thumb clusters what is a thumb cluster that sounds that sounds uh do you recommend it as a doctor though I mean it's probably good or I like I think it's good ergonomically but I'm not an expert in like ergonomics I do some of the yoga as you know but I would have to really do a little bit of research before I could recommend something as a doctor did you know that four out of five dentists recommend this keyboard is Che coming well he's he's all ready for it he's trying to come he's just having some difficulty and I'm trying to give him a hand okay you're screen sharing now I can hear YouTube okay weird I don't see a screen share um and you have the right input devices selected for audio and speakers I I mean come on chat y'all y'all teed me up for that one that was not like that was not like a oh my God clip it like oh my God Dr K made a joke about coming because people were asking if Chase come in and I was like he's trying to come like oh my God like okay so here's the thing there are two words that are homonyms but mean very different things right like is your mom coming on an airplane it's like yeah my mom is coming on an airplane like there's there's just so many different you know Dr K my tonsil hurts because of my TMJ and my teeth clenching what do I do um I would see a doctor for your TMJ homophones homonym homophone you're right homophone my bad I don't know what a homonym is homophone is two words that sound the same right yeah I I mean the the weird thing is I've never heard of TMJ causing tonsil problems that sounds weird it's the other reason to see a doctor is because if you've got problems with your tonsils like sometimes you'll get like weird autoimmune stuff and things like that allergies and infections so usually TMJ can actually cause problems with things like tinnitus um okay everything is the right setting you wanna try restarting comp oh my God Zoom interview let's do um okay he's gonna try to restart and then we've got backup plans okay stay with us chat thank you so much for being patient everybody sometimes in life the best things are worth waiting for and this conversation I guess has to be epic so here's the thing we got to talk about balance in life for a second so you know I hate to say this but everyone sort of thinks that like life is balanced right we're kind of like oh my God like this person has an advantage and so therefore like I have the same amount of advantages and I just need to uncover my advantages and like everyone sort of thinks like we sort of assume we live in this world where we assume that things are like equal the truth of the matter is we're not all born with like the same level of stat points it's like it's kind of like the old school d d where it's like you roll three D six six times and some people get really good stats and some people get really bad stats and that's like really the real tragedy of Life honestly this is my been my experience as a psychiatrist is that things are not fair or equal and and I think the more we understand that like hopefully off the better will be because I think the biggest problem is that sometimes like people just need more help than others and sometimes people are capable of helping more but the problem is that we compare right we're like okay like this person is doing this so I should do this or I feel less than this person because there's some sense of equality does that kind of make sense like if you make a comparison with someone else and you conclude that oh I should be doing this because this person is doing this or I feel less than this person because this person is doing all these things and I'm not doing that much no it's like y'all are like it's completely different game the reason that person is doing so much is because of chances are their circumstances in spawn point and y'all may say but like what do you mean like that's not how it is right isn't it like that's not how the world works but actually if you look at data it's kind of how it is so if you look at what you know what correlates the most with median income is socioeconomic standing so how rich your parents are things like parental involvement and whether parents like prioritize your education growing up it's not actually IQ like IQ doesn't correlate very tightly with median income and so if you it's really circumstances it's all about your spawn point so cut yourself a little bit of Slack chat and if someone is doing better than you at life it's okay for them to be doing better than you because you all are playing different games I discovered something recently if y'all are kind of curious who here struggles with Envy they'll struggle with Envy this is kind of related special stats from Fallout absolutely dude Okay so there's this really interesting text called the vishuda Maga which is the path of purification and it talks a lot about the different problems in our mind and a lot of people end up struggling with Envy right so let's like let's understand Envy for a second Envy is something that you see something in someone let's see oh was Che here no okay no problem let's do this I wonder though hmm okay sorry I was talking about Envy I'm trying to do tech support and teach all about Envy at the same time it's like what is going on here okay let's talk about Envy so if you struggle with Envy it's interesting because we don't really teach people okay here we go damn it or yay I suppose okay does this work okay I can hear you now okay right on sorry about that I don't know what's going on with disc I've never had those problems before oh it's all good man um let me do this let me just disconnect from the Discord call and yeah same turn this on there we go should be good just gonna get my camera settings figured out here and now I just realized I have a slight problem because what's that I'm gonna have to um I'm gonna have to change oh there you are oh okay okay cool yeah I don't know weird I've disc is always the best for me and I like we're on disc constantly but I don't know what's going on with it today yeah let me just um grab a I have to grab the right Chrome window oh I feel yeah so you can screen grab everything yeah so let me just do that real quick let's hope it works nope here we go all right hey hey I could I think we're good it's not a stream without a few technical difficulties yes absolutely man all right so we'll we'll we'll get to Envy at the end to chat yeah promise we'll do a quick segment on Envy I was talking about Envy maybe yeah so uh welcome Che hey thanks for having me on I appreciate it um thanks for being here and do you want to just tell us a little bit about we watched a couple of your Clips it's like it's good stuff man thanks man I appreciate it I appreciate it um and so tell us just a little bit about uh you know where we can find you what you do um so I'm on all social platforms at shade Arena uh I'm a stand-up comic I've been doing stand-up for about like 10 years um and that was kind of the Catalyst for me to start making content and do all those kinds of things uh in terms of creation was like uh I was doing stand-up pretty much every single night for seven or eight years and then pandemic hit couldn't do it anymore so then look for other mediums to keep creating uh and found that there was like huge reach on social media got like way more reach than you can get in a comedy club so then just started like hounding that really well to kind of get out to more people and sell more tickets and do all those things to make sure you can have a successful entertainment career that sounds hard uh it yeah it is hard like it's not easy but it's um I think it's a big part of if you that whole thing if you love what you do you'll never work a day in your life um being able to feel motivated because you really enjoy the process of of what you're doing makes it a whole lot easier and can you tell me what's it you said you were doing stand up every night for seven years yeah not like every single night but other my sort of my rule for myself was a night off every two weeks um and that's pretty I was pretty consistent with that for me to take a night off more than it honestly it was I had to set that rule because I wasn't taking enough time off um so I yeah pretty much every single night you would go out whether or not it was some little Open Mic or you're booked on a few shows in a night you try to get somewhere between 10 and 20 spots a week um so you can be going up and really like grinding and working on your craft uh that's something that's I I'm not too well versed with a lot of other uh performance arts but I know with stand up it's something very specific to stand up where you really want to be uh on stage as much as possible so can you tell us a little bit about that like what's it um and by the way is there is there something in particular you want to talk about today um I don't know if there's something in particular that I want to cover like I know we dive into mental health and I was just kind of ready to be upfront and forward with anything you threw at me okay and I I saw that for some reason it says that we're talking about death death oh yeah I know they I remember that was the they uh that was the thing they were like prompted those put forward uh in terms of you as there was a uh it was my rep or maybe it was directly from you asked what how do you deal with mental health and death is usually how I kind of ground myself that's bizarre can you tell us what that means yeah um it sounds very morbid but I think it's really peaceful like I think uh accepting that you're gonna die like I think if you like how often do you really bit and think about that like you're you're gonna die like that's inevitable like I think we because I know I definitely will prior to coming to acceptance the to the fact that I'm gonna die I would live in I wouldn't say it was like a fantasy but in a little bit of an unrealistic place where I was like oh maybe we'll get reach the Fountain of Youth there's all these technological advancements maybe something will happen where I will not die I will live forever or or whatever it is and I think there's people who convince themselves through mystical things or religious things that your soul will live on or all this other stuff which potentially does I don't have the answer to what happens after you die but all I can confirm is that you will die you no one has not died everyone has died very successfully um and being grounded in that in knowing that this experience is finite I don't know it gives me a a sense of peace and calm um well I think a lot of anxiety comes from not knowing what will happen so you're like okay what if like say if I was anxious about doing this podcast today what if it goes bad what if someone Clips something out of context or blah blah blah and then you start rambling off this unknown like uber found that when they one thing they added that really helped the customer process was showing you how far away your car was because that unknown gave the customer anxiety uh and made them yeah made them uncomfortable uh knowing that no matter what happens you will die uh gives me a sense of calm knowing that like oh no matter how bad things go or how good things go the end result is all the same so have some peace in knowing that uh you know the final outcome and so just live your life in whichever way you choose obviously try to be nice to people and and give a positive light around you but it don't stress yeah I mean because I I I've talked to some people who I I you know for the record I agree with you I think there's a lot of um everything from like psychoanalysis and Psychotherapy talks about dealing with the fear of death and even in like the Eastern uh kind of philosophies they talk a lot about how there's just a very fundamental fear of death in that getting to peace over that fear of death is really how you start to live life fully there's a book called The Tibetan book of living and dying and then we see that a lot in the practice of medicine where like you've got a patient with cancer and they like come to terms with it and it doesn't necessarily mean that they're gonna die like their cancer could be you know put into remission or even curable but I've seen firsthand a lot of the value of like accepting that you're gonna die and it can be for a lot of people very liberating or grounding it can also be very terrifying for a lot of people and a lot of people will panic because if I'm gonna die that means that like I don't have enough time to do everything that I want to do yeah I that's true but then I think it is definitely a motivator like I I think you accept death you understand there's no such thing as Perfection so you kind of when you start to cross those two things together which I'm I think a lot of us especially like you're in the creation field people who are trying to make stuff I think you can definitely um get uh what's the word like get caught up in this perfectionist mindset where Perfection doesn't exist so knowing that you're gonna die so you should take the leap towards the things you're going to do because you're going to run out of time uh and knowing that things can't be perfect and impossible for something to be perfect um a perfect example is I'm going to grease in uh September for a friend's wedding and my sister has wanted to go to Greece since she was about 20 and she's turning 40 this year so it's been like a 20-year thing if she's like I want to go to Greece supposed to go when she was young and then she was supposed to go on her honeymoon but then she had kids she got like pregnant right away and now she's got three kids and a husband and a wife and all this stuff and all these things are going on constantly and she was like I've always wanted to go to Greece and I was like just come with me just come and she was like oh I don't know if I can and I was like I'll buy your plane ticket let's just go let's just go to Greece let's go to Greece together because it's like it's you waiting for this Perfection for this moment for all the things to come together it's now 20 years as you've been putting a dream on hold it's like just just do things all the time that you want to do within reason don't put like you got kids don't put your kids at risk don't put your health at risk like I mean depending on what you consider putting at risk you want to go skydiving go skydiving um but just go do for one doing you learn more in the process of doing than you do in all this like sort of pre-prep idea of doing so like you say if I wanted I I'm a comedian if I spent a year learning about how to write jokes and learning about what I got to do if I get on stage and talking to Comedians and interviewing people I would have learned so much less than if I had just wrote Whatever I could write and then go to shows and do the Jewish is doing comedy in that year so just go and do and you learn more in that process um and knowing that you're gonna die you can hopefully motivate you to go do um but yeah so I a death is a big motivator and calmer and like it just grounds you in like sometimes you got to like touch yourself and realize like this is tactile this is real the stuff around me is real oh room um and you like I don't know ages yeah they're bombing but check if I just go out there and do stuff first of all it's scary and second of all there are consequences of course what if I what if I do it wrong well you're gonna do it wrong like I think that's the the the acceptance in knowing though like living your life in a in sort of this paralyzing stage of what if first you can every negative argument of what if you can just counter with a positive argument of what if you can be like oh what if I get hurt what if you don't like that we're floating in the same area of logic where it's actually probably more likely that the positive happens depending on what the situation is but if we're talking about like I don't know you're gonna go out and uh sign up for beer league soccer or something and you're like oh I've wanted to do this but I didn't like I recently signed up for Muay Thai classes and because I realized I had been putting it off for 10 years sorry we have a oh no worse I'm I'm working can we talk about this in a minute like in an hour an hour and maybe 70 minutes okay you can give me your sign come here okay then shoe okay okay great thank you school is out I love it I love it thanks okay thank you she made the ace anyway um yeah so you were saying uh that that it operates on the same level of logic that there's like a positive what if for a negative one it what if yeah and obviously it depends on what the situation is but like like I said I recently signed up for Muay Thai classes because I did the same thing of waiting for this perfect moment I've been putting off going to Muay Thai for 10 years I've wanted to do it for that long um I boxed when I was younger I've always had a Fascination and admiration for fight Sports I never I don't even think I'll ever Spar um I but I like learning I like learning while I exercise I think martial arts are an incredible skill to have it's like a skill you can use naked which is like not a lot of skills are like that um but uh I've been putting it off for 10 years and there's all those things that were going on my head it's like oh what if I don't have enough time what if I can't get it in what if blue blah blue blue there was all these what ifs and I was like just go just go to the class just go sign up and just do the class and then just take it from there and then it fit into my schedule I figured out where it fit now that I was doing it get better in the class when I can show up when everything worked everything worked with this thing I was putting off for 10 years for a perfect moment I got to fit into my life in probably about a month and that's a month of going like once a week and now I go like two or three times a week um and I when I can't go I don't go but I'm doing the thing that I've wanted to do for a long time yeah so so Jay I mean just to kind of I get what you're saying but like how are you able to do that how I I think just you just go and do it and you accept that failure is you will fail at not at everything but you will like even this class or sometimes I fail to show up or I fail to schedule them properly or I fail to give my best or even focus properly in class you you you will fail and accepting that that is just like death inevitable that Perfection doesn't exist that failure is absolutely absolutely going to happen as long as I mean I guess you could avoid failure by doing nothing if you lived in like a padded room but you would probably still fail at something within the confines of that room um you'd fail at life dude yeah he found a life there you go uh so accepting that the those things are part of your reality gives you this freedom and it's also like what are you trying to attain are you trying to be like the richest person in the world are you trying to be like the best Muay Thai fight in the world the Best comedian in the world like are you trying to chase something are you just trying to experience pieces of life um like there's certain parts of my life where I'm trying to Excel and there's certain parts of my life where I just like to partake and taste uh and enjoy like if I go to a restaurant I'm not trying to aerate to the wine and the food to get this certain experience from it I'm just well I just like food I like eating and I'm sitting and eating and hanging with friends and we're talking and shooting the and and the whole moment is is good uh yeah I think it's it's fast so just uh it's interesting to hear you kind of talk about this stuff because I've had a couple of cases where I've worked with people who um we've seen some interesting consequences of challenging their fear of death so the one really bizarre thing is that a lot of people struggle with procrastination yes and one thing that I found is that like in 20 to 25 percent of people that I work with who have a fear of death most of them are actually pretty successful to begin with but if you can conquer your fear of death procrastination actually disappears and what happens in these people is like if you're kind of procrastinating right you're waiting for the right time and in their mind they sort of have this infinite amount of time the passage of time is really painful they can feel every day that they lose they can feel every year that they lose they can feel every five years that they lose but they don't really think about how much time they have left yes and once you realize that like this game ends in a certain amount of time it can be incredibly transformative because then like what are you gonna do today if you want to attain this thing like you can wait for the perfect moment and then it may or may not happen you can spend 10 years waiting for it you can spend 10 years planning for it getting ready for it prepping for it researching for it but you're never going to do it and once you sort of realize that okay like the time and The Hourglass is running out and whether I do it or don't do it the time gets spent either way and oftentimes what happens with people who procrastinate is they're looking for a good deal right that's what Perfection is like I want to set everything up so when I do it I'm successful so that my investment yields a good return yes once you understand that you're gonna die that cost is being spent like over and over and over again like you're losing that time no matter what you decide to do so the question is what do you want to do today do you want to that time is gone disappearing and and so sometimes what people will do is they'll like sort of realize oh crap like I have to like start living today even if it is not the way that I want or and I really love this what you said earlier about are you trying to attain or are you trying to experience yeah and I think I think both are are valid forms of of experience life experiencing life but there are uh I know there are certain moments where I think you gotta like step back and just experience like I think we do the like what you're saying about oh I'm waiting for this perfect moment there's this I think we're taught this idea of like retirement and and uh we're gonna build for a better tomorrow and all these things instead of just cashing in a little bit right now because tomorrow is never uh guaranteed like my like I watched my dad my dad was a very good example of this was my dad worked super hard worked two jobs for a long time my parents kind of grinded themselves to dust they were like kind of lower income family and then moved into like a middle income family um but they they sacrificed a lot to make sure that we had some stuff and their marriage was always Rocky and it was a lot of things of trying to fit into the slots of like standard uh uh like Suburban lifestyle uh and then when my parents when I got older I got in I was thinking like 20 my parents got divorced and then it felt like uh my dad kind of moved on and started Living his life the way he wanted to he was traveling a lot more he was kind of doing whatever he wanted he was retired he met a new lady all these things and he did that for about four years and then he got Alzheimer's and he got Alzheimer's from uh sleepless nights of working constant like graveyard shifts and stuff it was a it's we don't have a direct correlation with that but the type of Alzheimer's he has is non-genetic and is exacerbated from lack of sleep um so he said he sacrificed all these things to live in this idea of what he thought he was supposed to live in for a better tomorrow and then when he got the opportunity to have it he had a few years in there and then lost the ability to live that better moral so it's like capture these things now a little bit more uh and experience these parts of life now a little bit more and don't get caught up too much in this like work now save for later lifestyle because you might not get the later and also you wanna even if you are older and you live into your late years like you want it when you're in your younger years you want to be out with your friends and doing stuff and trying to drink in as much as you can because those experiences are good and they don't necessarily have to cost you a lot they're me and my um me and my buddies go up to a friend's Cottage and there's like you know last time I went up there was like 10 of us we're all comedians we would like do mushrooms and go on Hikes and just like laugh harder than I've ever laughed before and one of my buddies the guy who whose Cottage it is and this isn't like a fancy Cottage this is a place where we'd have to jump on a bicycle and then ride down next to the lake because there was a toilet down there we use the toilet there because the toilet was busted in the cottage um but one of my buddies was like this is what I live for these moments and he's 100 right the like the amount of fun and joy we had in like that four to eight period is it is bigger than a lot of any of the other experiences that I've had so and if you get super rich and super successful and then you're doing that on a yacht rather than a cottage where the toilet doesn't work it doesn't matter the people and the experience are the same and you're going to get the same enjoyment out of it so try and focus on those experiences and having those moments because one day you will not be able to so I trade that's fascinating can I ask so it sounds like you're you said your parents got divorced when you were 20 yeah yeah so they yeah sorry go ahead go ahead no go for it no I was just gonna say they had they were they were uh yeah together for like 30 years or so but it was not uh I I think at the start it was good and then the financial things were always a burden uh and I think that it just uh slowly crumbled apart and they definitely did this stay together for the kids okay and and when would you say that you you like sort of found that grounding with fear of death oh I think it probably would have been it was definitely before I moved to New York I haven't been here for very long but I would say like five six years ago I think uh I really came to terms with like oh what I was doing I didn't it it didn't like staving for the future saving for not that I don't save I'm very smart with my money I'm not telling people who are watching this hey just spend all your money willy-nilly but focusing on the enjoyment side of life rather than pushing myself into an area where I don't enjoy myself to save for something that may not even exist uh yeah I think it was through doing stand-up and stuff and kind of self-discovery through that probably five or six years ago was probably when I came to terms with it and how many years ago was your dad diagnosed with Alzheimer's I wanna say four could have been five years ago there's definitely a correlation between those two because like watching him not get the opportunity to live his life was like oh well I'm not going to make the same mistake for sure yeah I mean I was just like surprised by how you know that that seems like that seems significant to me oh oh absolutely and it's like it was it was kind of a weird experience because I because there was very much a division in my house my parents weren't very close and they were fighting and then so I distanced myself from them so I felt like I never really was close to either of them and then kind of started building a relationship with my dad but then he got Alzheimer's so then it was like we didn't couldn't really communicate or anything anymore um so it was a weird sense but I definitely saw the process of how this stuff happened and I was like I don't want to make that same mistake I really want to take the time to enjoy and live my life this trip to Greece is another example not just for my sister but for myself I almost didn't go I almost was like oh you know I'm gonna have to take so much time off work blah blah blah all the things you tell yourself I was like just go to Greece and then I booked an extra week to go to Berlin on my own and then it like I've never been to Europe let's go see a few different things um because yeah because I'm like oh when will I get this opportunity again and how long am I going to put this opportunity off for yeah I mean that's interesting because I I you know some people I've worked with Che when they haven't experience like yours they like you seem to have pivoted hard towards like living life and loving it you know sometimes when I work with people what I see is they they kind of get crushed by it like it's sort of like okay I'm just getting to know my dad you know I'm starting to build a relationship and like he's kind of taken away from me and then they're they sort of like enter into this like paranoid zone of like you know like it feels like pillars in my life can be like just taken away from me and if if anything can get can disappear at any time how do I find any kind of stability how do I because I I don't want to make the same mistake right so it's kind of weird like you're saying I don't want to make the same mistake so I'm going to YOLO it and some people are like I don't want to make the same mistake so I can't ever YOLO it like I've got to be sure because I can't afford to make the mistake I think um I think I've always been a very rational person I've always been very like grounded in reality um two plus two equals four like always in all of my is I remember one of the earliest not one of my earliest memories but oh my earliest example of this I think was maybe five or six I used to suck my index finger I'll check my index finger and play with my ear this was like a comfort thing I did um and I was doing it so much it was like pushing my teeth forward and my parents were like oh they would put hot sauce on my finger these different things to try and get me to stop and nothing would get me to stop the thing that got me to stop was they told me they're like you're gonna get braces and I was like okay I don't care they're like you know people might make fun of you if you get braces I was like I don't care they're like it's gonna hurt I said I don't care they said it's gonna cost three thousand dollars and I was like oh that's a lot of money and then I stopped that was the the rational grounding of like it's gonna cost money that's like I understood that my my parents always money was a big thing growing up so I knew that was going to be a big deal that's what made me stop I've always been very very rational so I I guess I don't know if this is healthy or unhealthy but I saw what I was losing I saw that I didn't have as close of a relationship with either of my parents and as upsetting as that is and I I thought I was gonna have this opportunity like I remember my dad came to visit me when I was in Toronto and this is before this is a few years before I got diagnosed we had like a week together where we were like going out eating hanging out and when my family was all together there was definitely it was everything was very disingenuous um uh and my mom isn't the most like trustworthy person she's a little bit of a liar and a little bit of a manipulator and so there's this like weird um oh like I guess there was like a weird hierarchy in the family no one was no one felt like they were being honest with each other and everyone felt like they were walking on eggshells uh with all interactions so then now that this was all removed I felt like my Dad we had like an honest week with each other where we honestly talked to each other's two people getting really getting to know each other um and then he caught Alzheimer's not long after that but that was like we had that week together uh and then he definitely started to go before then and communication was not the same and then you got diagnosed with Alzheimer's so I it would have been nice to have that time I felt like I was going into this next stage of my life where I was going to get to know my dad as an authentic person who's gonna get to know me as an authentic person but I didn't have that and I also didn't lose it because it was never there um so I just had to come to terms with it I just had to come to terms with that was that's reality what's it like having a mom who's a little bit of a liar uh it's another one of those things man you uh I there was a long time where I was very angry about it um uh uh the thing she said the the like the relationship we had I didn't I haven't talked to her in years and years and years it's a relationship I cut out because I felt like it just didn't benefit me in any way bringing if I was to bring her back into my life it would I think it would be a detriment to My Life um so it was another thing I just had to accept that that relationship doesn't exist but I have close friends I have close brothers and sisters and I have these people where I can have these growth conversations I can uh I can ask them questions I if I need help in in certain areas I have a good support circle around me is it okay if I we we I ask you a couple questions about that of course so because here's what I'm thinking I think that unfortunately not all mothers are great not all mothers are even good um and the challenges that oftentimes it's hard to tell or hard to accept when you're in that situation and I imagine there may be people who are listening to this conversation right now who are in situations with like a toxic parent and they may not even realize it yeah um because oftentimes what toxic parents will do is they trick children into thinking that the child is the problem like that's how they function um and as long as you have a child to blame then as a parent you don't have to take responsibility yes and then the child is put in this situation where they're bearing all the blame and so they never even think oh I need to actually like remove this person from my life for set kind of boundaries because I'm actually the one that's the problem I need to fix things but that they go on trying to fix the wrong part of the equation but that's partisan busted so they end up inevitably failing over and over and over again they fail over and over and over again the problems still continue so they try harder and it just creates this vicious cycle yeah so what did it I mean how did you discover that your mom was a liar um I think for me I when I was 18 I moved out and I moved to the coast I lived I grew up in British Columbia like maybe uh hour outside of Vancouver um and so I moved to the coast and I lived there I was going to college out there and so I got to have like time away and grow and be my own person I think that's very important for people to like kind of leave their Hometown because I think you can be very disingenuous in high school because that's what high school's about high school is kind of about informing um to fit in so I got to go and be my own person and then I moved to Mexico for a little while uh and I was uh living up there for three years I got to grow and be my own person so I had like a physical separation and got to do a lot of self-exploration and um through that came to terms with that a lot of the things they said weren't true I could see as you grow as a person you can see the inconsistencies in the stories they told how they would talk from person to person see how they would lie to other other people um and see how they would treat you in front of people and but treat you in private um and the then you can come to terms with being in control of the situation and knowing that this person is like that and you don't have to uh you don't have to carry their baggage like this person like you were saying they would blame you for things that's like oh that's not mine I don't need to hold on to that uh I can let that go and they're gonna choose to be whoever they're going to be and I don't need to change them I think a big part of it was me trying to fix these things and realizing that I'm the youngest in the family like I uh I for a while I felt like I should have mended something between my parents or there was like two sides of the family try to amend something there uh and realizing that I'm the youngest and being like Oh no all these people should be more mature and able to deal with this more than I am I'm not carrying any of this you guys go deal with it if you want to be friends be friends if you don't you don't I do not care and I'm going to hold on to the relationships that I feel benefit me better or at least benefit both sides and this one clearly does not and having the separation from that person lets you sort of uh unravel all the things that happened um what kind of two-facedness did you see from your mom like can you give us an example um yeah a great example uh would be like there was a family member who was sick uh on my uh like is someone who is on my sister's side uh so I have like a split down the family where her brother and sister on one side and a sister on the other side so my sister on one side a family member was sick and my brother and sister on the other side from my dad's side we're gonna go visit my mom told them no don't visit she doesn't want visitors but they and that family member was sick had a separate relationship with my brother and sister and found out later that this person never said that that they that my mom had made this up to keep a division through in the family which is that's a very hey it's yeah you're just lying and and moving chess pieces around for whatever reason uh and uh yeah that it was stuff like that where you just you just learned that you can't trust a person and so there's no point in like kind of keeping them around wow um so let me let me kind of recap sort of what I heard and and I think this is actually great so the first thing is how do you know if you're in a relationship with someone like parent or otherwise where it is kind of like toxic and you're like being taken advantage of so I think a big part of it is if you feel like a chess piece because I think even people who don't want to admit that their parent is a problem like they feel like a chess piece you kind of feel like the sort of situation where like okay I'm a pawn and I'm being like thrust into battle and I'm supposed to like someone is sending me into battle to like take out the enemy Queen yeah Rook but I'm just outgunned and I like I'm I'm doomed to fail I'm set up to fail and then what they do is they're like Pawn like I sent you in there to do a job and you can't even do that job and then you feel responsible right because you're the one who's actually on the front lines yes and then what happens is like you're kind of left in this situation where they're placing the responsibility on you but they're not giving you the freedom or the control to actually try to solve the problem because I'm also kind of noticing that your your mom kind of set you up in a lot of ways where she didn't say like you know she didn't let you fly free yeah um I I think it's really interesting that you actually started when I asked you how did you know that she was a liar you actually started with physical distance yes which I think is something that is underrated so a lot of times especially nowadays with the internet if someone is in a toxic relationship they think that the answer is something that they can do or they can learn I mean hell I mean our channel is successful because people try to come to us for answers for their problems yes I think the real tragedy is that sometimes like it actually starts with physical distance and if you look at research on trauma the the person who originally developed I don't know if you're familiar with like complex PTSD like this term or concept no no so the you know PTSD is like a as post-traumatic stress disorder it's usually induced by one event so like you know I was either assaulted or I was like you know I had a bad I was in war or something and there was like a really bad Mission or something like that but there's another flavor of PTSD which is called complex PTSD which is when the trauma is chronic so these are like people who um are in like concentration camps people who are prisoners of War people who are an abusive relationships like with parents growing up and the really interesting thing is that in order to heal from that the first thing you need is like safety and space so a lot of times I see people that are struggling to like fix their problems like in their four walls but what I think is really interesting is that physically getting space seemed to be like the first step for you oh yeah absolutely I feel like that physical space it gives you the freedom to think and move without this person you're not turning to this person for advice anymore uh because obviously they're going to give you their skewed view uh and you build relationships outside of people who know them and and that's a like a great way to know if someone is toxic it's like when you have the relationships outside of that person you can compare the relationships you can be like okay this I have this friend over here and when I hang out with them I have fun and they don't ask me for things or need me to do stuff for them they don't try to like put me in compromising situations and then I have a friend over here and when I do when I leave these interactions I often feel bad or less than and I they make me feel guilty for things and they yeah all they Implement these negative emotions on me so when you can start to compare and contrast to things side by side you can start to see that one is clearly better than the other and the and the one that's bad is using a lot of weird tendencies that the other people around you aren't using and that it helps you understand uh have a understanding of what is right and wrong in a relationship with someone yeah and I think it's it's interesting because you kind of said that so what you're describing almost sounds like a cult of one yeah you're like you're like in a cult but there's just like one member and it's you and then there's the leader yeah and they're imposing a lot of this like you know almost like brainwashing or like manipulation like controlling your relationships like inducing emotions in you like guilt and and I think it's really interesting how the way that you saw that was noticing the inconsistencies from the outside does this person like say things in weird ways do they try to gatekeep information do they try to keep you from like talking directly to other people um it feels very cultish actually and then the last thing that I think is really really important is that a lot of times even if people can recognize that this is toxic and even if they can get away one of the things I've noticed is that they carry the responsibility with them yeah and so I've had tons of patients who will every time they go home for the holidays it's like it's a mess but they feel obligated and they feel guilty and they're like okay I gotta take my like bitter medicine you know I can build my life but for two weeks out of the year I gotta go back and and go back into this and one thing that I think is really cool is that I think you're a quitter yeah right and part of the problem is in in today's society we actually think about being a quitter is a bad thing but I think some of the the most interesting things quitting a relationship is one of the healthiest and best things you can do yes and I would say that quitting the wrong relationship has a greater impact in your life than finding the right one yes and just being able to say like hey you know what I'm not responsible for this I quit I'm done yes you can sort of figure out your own yes I think that's uh like taking things and putting them back on your terms like when I come to visit now I don't necessarily come I came home for Christmas this past year for the first time in like 10 years and I was like I don't know if I'm gonna do this again not because the actual Christmas experience was bad but just because they're traveling around Christmas time sucks but I I took traveling and going home and made it my own for a while was like I'm coming in the summertime when it's nice out when you do outdoor activities when I want to be there and if I'm not there for Christmas or something that's it I'm doing that for you constantly and I've done things for you guys for so much so now I'm going to do things for myself and we can make things equal um but I'm not going to compromise so far that I I I'm not having a good time with everyone else's I'm curious has that affected your um is it okay if I ask you like a couple questions about romantic relationships oh for sure um has that affected your romantic relationships at all so to be completely transparent on romantic relationships I've only dated maybe like two girls seriously uh and each time the relationships haven't last very long I'm usually once I get about six months in I'm like uh I don't know if I want to date anymore I am in definitely a mental space where I don't know um what I want I'm definitely super work focused so I've up until just about recently like this year I was like maybe I put effort into cultivating like a proper relationship again because everything has been work focused and that's been like I've seen relationships as sort of detrimental to me working harder where now I don't as much but I also uh am trying to come to terms whether or not I'm like am I would I be happier in like an open relationship or do I want a monogamous relationship or like what are the standards that uh like what I know what the standards are of what people will think we should do like you're supposed to meet someone fall in love get married and like the white pick a fence or whatever but I'm like is that because that's what we're genetically made to do or is that uh like subconscious programming in quotations like there's all these social norms that are kind of falling apart before us and being rebuilt in different ways and I don't know where I fit in there and so now I'm interested in exploring those things again to see what I want but yeah romantically I haven't ever really pursued anyone and I think definitely my parents having a rocky relationship for so long I when I was younger I just assumed that relationships failed like if I was in my 20s uh definitely like all my relationships were like my early to mid 20s every person I dated that my mentality was like well this is going to end eventually like this is there were in our 20s like we're not going to meet someone we're going to be with for the rest of our life like that's just that seemed completely irrational to me because I saw older people taking a shot at it and them failing miserably so what chance do we have this is more just for fun okay interesting so it sounds like it's something you're thinking through trying to figure out what's what's right for you I also notice your being quite analytical about it in terms of okay like the world has changed so even if there was a formula that arguably worked which I I think you know we know that monogamy has been has not been um it works for some works for it doesn't work for other it's like it's yeah I think it it and that I'm trying to figure out where I fit in that like do I want to be monogamous do I not want to be monogamous like and then there's all the other things of like you're jealousy your emotions you're that get that come into play and and really feeling that out and not rushing into anything because I feel like I have a lot of time with this and spending the time to figure out what I want um yeah I think really focusing on how I feel through each situation is like a great recipe and communicating that to whoever I'm with is a great recipe for being successful um so you mentioned I may need it I just love the kids sure go for it um so uh a couple other things so you mentioned that you're focused on Craft right now can you just tell us a little bit about like what it's like to be a comedian and and how you view your craft what it takes to succeed yeah um for Comics It's Like Comics are a different breed for sure uh it's something I you that you don't really get it until you're in I think any like if you get really serious and to CrossFit uh then the people you hang out with the way you look at the world like if you go out to eat you look at the menu differently than someone who's not very focused on their Gallery intake every day like it it becomes who you are as a person and that potentially was who you are were all along comedy is very similar whereas like you're you're constantly joking about stuff riffing about stuff everything for the most part everything is on the table when you sit down with Comics very rarely do we go like oh uh how's the weather or so it was hot today you try you go like right to this I was serious isn't the right word it's just like we want to talk about real tangible things and have more intimate conversations with people because we divulge our personal on stage in front of strangers so peer-to-peer it's like yeah that we know we can talk like that and it sometimes when you're in conversations with people who uh can't do that it can be a little understimulating one thing about going like family get-togethers is there's there's always this thing and this is just I think this is just a good etiquette but you sometimes when you're hanging out with a bunch of people and family like the conversations stay very gray like all the we're putting the kids in this no one gets too political no one gets too uh too deep into any topics because no one wants to get anyone uncomfortable or comedy it's the exact opposite we can argue and talk about different things and everyone's on the same page because whether or not we agree because that is what we do um so that's my one of the best parts about the craft is like the Hang but then in terms of of creating and doing it it's like you try and write every day at least this is my process you try and write every day you try and get on stage I try to do 10 to uh 20 times a week you want to be getting up and trying out your stuff working on stuff taking it to new rooms uh evolving as the platform evolves so like uh everyone's doing like crowd work clips now so I make sure I do a bunch of crowd work when I'm going on the road so I have stuff to clip out and keep the social media and all those platforms going social is a big side of it podcasting's a big side of it now um so understanding how to learn and use these new skills as the landscape develops and changes um while constantly trying to get funnier and funnier and funnier and I think depending on what kind of comedian you are you value things at different stages like some people have Ultra successful podcasts and live they're not as good I'm not naming any names or talk about any specific is just something that happened it's like if the podcast is by far you're sorry just the sounds of New York City right now I can barely hear anything oh you can't okay great great um but uh uh yeah like if you if you value the podcast super practice your main income bringer then maybe your live stuff isn't as good um but their podcasting could be incredible uh but I think for myself the core has always been stand up first I want the live performance I want people to watch my online content go oh this is great I love this then come to the live show and be like yo this is incredible this is the this is the best because that's the thing I've been doing for the longest and crafting the most I really want at the end of this whole stand-up journey to be considered one of the great stand-up comics uh and all the other things that kind of come around it are just uh beneficial to my standard career beings so potent so how how many hours so you say you try to write every day you try to get on stage every day yes what does writing look like for you um so my writing process is like a little chaotic I don't think a lot of people write like this but I will uh open uh I have this folder on my phone both in Tick Tock and in Instagram called the best and in the best folder are like a bunch of videos and memes and stuff that have made me laugh I'll set a timer for 10 minutes and I'll sit there and I'll watch those for 10 minutes um because that gets me in a state where I'm laughing and having a good time and then when I'm in that like really happy jovial state of like laughing out loud I then switch over to writing and then I'll write for an hour and so I'll set a time for an hour turn my phone on airplane mode and it's literally me like I'll have some ideas written down and I'll look at like okay like right now I'm trying to work on a joke about Genghis Khan so pull up the Genghis Khan joke in my phone and then walk around my apartment talking out loud to myself like all this and like I'm actually on stage on the tone and mannerisms and everything so I'm like embody seeing what I do and then when something hits when I start making myself laugh with what I'm coming up with in jokes then you go back to the phone write that stuff down quickly and then try to springboard off of that and keep that going for as long as possible um that's my whole writing process how long does it take you to come up with a joke on average oh it's so hit and miss man sometimes you get a joke that like you come up with something and then you try it out and then it doesn't work but like maybe like 50 30 to 50 work so you like take it back to the drawing board and you Tinker it my favorite part of stand up is the tinkering like okay this didn't work with this and this works so then you take those parts that didn't work and you go through the same process watch the funny stuff right for an hour go back tinker tinker tinker do that again do that again do it again and until you have multiple pieces that work the best feeling and stand up for me is when you have like a new 10 minutes that is kind that has some moments and other parts are rough and other parts are good and it's like up and down and you spend like however long sometimes it could be two weeks sometimes it could be a month and you're tinkering each part and maybe you take out a joke this doesn't work and you put in another joke and it works uh and then you have then the whole 10 minutes like congeals and comes together and every bit's working and then you have probably about a week straight maybe four days where you can do that set over and over and over and you have no guilt because it's newly working so you still got to try it in its in its ultimate form and it kills and then once you do it for too long you start to feel guilty for doing jokes that you know that work and you're not working anything new and you have to go back to the stuff that is Rocky and start having rockier sets again and build up um so how the back to the original question of how long it takes to write a joke it's completely random sometimes the first time you say something it's funny from day one some jokes I've had jokes that have taken like six months because you work on them for a bit they're going nowhere and I call it putting it on ice you put a joke on Ice you stop working on you stop performing it and then sometimes when I'm stuck in my writing I'll scroll back in my phone to see what are the old notes of stuff I was working on you oh this idea you pull it out again because that once you haven't looked at something for a few months you forgot what direction you were trying to shove the joke in so then you have an open mind of where you could potentially take the premise and then you can and then sometimes the you had a base that was good but the rest built on top of it wasn't good now you've scrapped the top and now you're building on it again and it builds in a great Direction and then maybe stops at a certain point and then you go through that process again this is very involved yo yeah you live and breathe and are a part of your jokes they're like an extension of yourself and your opinions and your ideas and your thought process and what you find funny the and this is standard like most comedians will work this hard I don't know if most will work this hard I think a lot I think anyone who you see who you think is funny and has like if you watch someone and they can make you laugh repeatedly on stage for an hour I would think yes I don't know if they would describe it in the same way um I don't necessarily always have the we talk about comedy a lot but the you don't want to get too self-indulgent with your uh process with other Comics um because it can kind of sound like you're up your own butt uh but it is like it you you're living and breathing and feeding yourself off of your ideas just your ideas literally just talking or you're nothing's even taxed out I don't have to like build a thing and then sell it like I have to sell you reacting how you have a an internal involuntary laughter response to what I thought of in my head and said to you and that is a very intimate connection to something um yeah and that's just the that's the process over and over and over again and I think there's a lot of self-discovery in that because in at least for me to get better at this I remember when I switched from basically writing like call and response jokes I would say the first like six or seven years of me doing stand-up was all call and response like I know I I say this to an audience they laugh and I can repeat that process over and over again um at like yeah like the seven year mark I started writing material that I honestly found funny that I I could now take what I found funny and translate that to a crowd like sometimes you'll see newer Comics try something really edgy and they'll be like oh you can't handle this because the audience responds poorly and what it is it's like no you haven't done the work to translate your sense of humor to the audience and your sense of humor you know is it sorry hilarious about that is that's also what therapists do so therapists like say something and it doesn't sit well with a patient they're like oh you can't handle it yeah that's that's not and they don't do the work of translating or even workshopping their ideas they're just convinced that the patient is in denial it's your job to make that person accept it or lack to it or take the the like the work that you're giving them to better themselves that is your job as the therapist or as the Entertainer it's not the audience job to eat whatever slop you throw at them um like they bought tickets they spent money some of the therapists that I've known are like that though they're like yeah no like if you're not enjoying the slop it's like a problem on your end yeah it's like no no no you're especially you're supposed to you're supposed to help this person grow and and the way the way for them to grow is to understand that I'm right okay right uh and but we I you see a lot of comics struggle with that and it's like they haven't done the work to you know make that translation hearing you do this I I'm very tempted to try stand up myself give it a shot I just because I thought it was I mean I knew I know it's hard obviously because it's not you know it's got to be hard but I'm I I wanna I wanna get destroyed on stage just once I see what it's like audiences now are pretty Savvy and pretty generous and it depends on where you go some places are like way less forgiving um but for the most part if you go out and you do a show and you write your five minutes and you go out and try it out you'll only be destroyed by like deafening silence if it goes really poorly but definitely in the context of a show where it's like these Comics are doing are new and they're trying it out for the first few times you get a lot more of a generous crowd which can be great it's a great motivator um but I always encourage everyone who wants to try to try it there's no barrier to entry it literally if you can write words down on a piece of paper and speak into a microphone and some people can't even do that perfectly and they're still very very successful comedians um and then you should give it a shot if you don't like it then anyone who is doing stand-up I know some people who are like doing it because they think it'll turn into something which maybe it will but they don't enjoy doing it I can't imagine a worse hell because a lot of it sucks a lot of it it's like you're in stinky bars around surly's uh around like surly's like uh you're at a bar and there's like drunk surveys like bar flies um like they're Surly like yeah yeah like grumpy old dudes who like go to a place and drink for that's their thing um and you you have to like enjoy that whole process before it starts to get like a little bit more Glitz and Glam and then even when it gets Glitz and Glam there's a lot of grinding and flying and taking pictures for hours with people um which I enjoyed this entire process and if I didn't that would be hell on Earth wow yeah so you know it's interesting because you talk about how hard it is and I'm kind of like so I'm a little bit skeptical isn't the right word I think you're you're very authentic but I just don't think a lot of what you talk about translates to normal human beings no I think um a people a lot of people describe me as like their inside voice like I say things that people think and that's not my intention I'll be like Oh I'm saying what no one else will and that's not what I'm doing at all I'm very honest about my opinions about certain things no I mean but that that's kind of what I'm talking about like it's not the opinions themselves it's like so so like as a kid your parents are like children will make fun of you unless you stop sucking on your finger yeah and you're like eh yeah it'll hurt it'll mess up your teeth you're like eh yeah right and then and you're talking about going out there and just doing it and like sort of you know accepting death and like these are these are like big things man like death is scary for most human beings yeah and like imma go do Muay Thai imma go up on stage I'm a bomb in front of people failure is a part of life like you're you're kind of like you know Chad moaning it just like like even as a kid you're like who cares what people think and and I I get that you you you speak very authentic I mean like I think you're genuine I don't think we're getting any but I'm just like dude like most people like avoid pain you don't seem to give um I think part of it is my Constitution like I part of the rationalizing I'm like well if I go on stage and it goes bad that's fine like nothing really bad comes of that like I'm not going to lose a limb and have to walk with a prosthetic forever like nothing really bad comes from that they're going to Muay Thai class I know I'm going to start a beginner level and I'm going to move up and there might be some classes that are harder than others do you feel bad when you're at beginner level no no because everyone starts at beginner level everyone has to begin at something there's a guy in the class who's 50 who's been doing it for like I want to say like between five and ten years that means he started when he was like 40. and the guy's incredible he's hit super hard you think in incredible shape like um but he had to be a brand new guy at 40. uh so it's like here's the thing I I have you always been like that um yeah like I said I've always been very rational and grounded and I think you I've definitely one of the I think this also comes if we're going back to what we're talking about before the relationship with my mom my mom was very much Keeping Up Appearances and worrying about what other people thought about her and I've turned tried to turn out of that real hard is like don't care what other people think about you it was all at all for one you have no idea what other people think about you so stressing over that is like pointless and if people think negative things about you people will think negative people the ultra super the most successful famous people in the world like richest like people who apparently essentially aspire to be like well not everyone but some of us they are the most scrutinized people publicly so it's like you can't control any of that stuff um and I try to find humor in it so I think that's where it comes from it's like trying to get away from that keeping up appear references um because I think it adds no value to life um and trying to do what I want to do and have fun with that and yeah knowing that you're gonna suck at almost everything the first time you do it but enjoying that process like there's certain things on my bucket list that I'm like I know I'm gonna suck but I want to get good um like I love video games and uh I want to get really good at a video game before I die uh and I'm not I'm like oh I I decided like any like twitch shooter that's done I'm too old for that like I can't I don't have the reaction term for it so it's like I need something strategy based so I'm gonna go with Pokemon I mean I just got I got the new Pokemon I'm gonna start my Pokemon Journey learning about all the different types and everything it's all a strategy based game so if I put in enough work and learn enough about the platform which it will be a lot of work but if I enjoy the process of learning all that and it's great and then I get to that goal it's going to be a whole experience at a whole different Road and a whole new community and different people to relate to on different things and then different experience to have in life that keeps life fun and fruitful and exciting can we go back to the 50 year old dude who's good at Muay Thai yeah I feel like the average experience of let's say I don't know how old you are but let's say people our age and I'm probably a little bit older than you and then even like younger like let's say I'm like 25 and I'm gonna like I'm gonna listen I'm I'm a faithful follower of the Gospel of Che and so I'm gonna go out now I'm gonna live life right because death is inevitable and you gotta Seize the Day carpe diem I'm gonna go to a class I'm gonna go to Muay Thai because I'm a be something I'm yeah I'm gonna learn how to defend myself I'm gonna get in shape I'm gonna do all these things I'm gonna get my ass kicked by a 50 year old dude yeah and then I'm like well that sucks this guy is 50. and well I'm getting my ass beat and and then I asked I was like oh did you like learn when you were a kid and he's like nah I'm relatively new I started when I was 40 and then you're like well I guess I ain't going back well I think part of going through these experience is to do them intelligently as well like you don't just go and like or martial arts in general uh when I found the gym that I'm training at I tried a couple gyms before and they weren't bad in terms of like oh they the trainers were too aggressive and I didn't feel safe that's a very important part of martial arts is you want to go to a place where you feel safe but I felt like there were more workout classes uh and I wasn't no one was really coming up to me and being like Oh you're not kicking right you're not doing this right and I that's what I wanted I wanted if I'm having not as good of a workout but I wanted to learn how to do the things properly so do like take the steps to make sure you learn stuff sit down with people um can I jump in for a second and sorry sorry if this is I'm I I don't think you understood what I said okay okay right like it seems like it completely went over you that like people are like people feel bad like that you know well I guess if something makes you feel bad it's like at least you you tried it like if you went to the class what do you do when you feel bad when I feel bad um sometimes I do just watch funny videos on the internet and they make me feel good and then you're just done and you just you can just go back to I'm very fortunate that I've never battled with depression so I am a very unique case on that I'm very anxiety sometimes sometimes I feel very anxious about stuff like because I do pile on too much work and stuff sometimes so it's like getting those things done taking a breather um but yeah I guess if something makes you upset then try to avoid doing it but the whole point of me doing Muay Thai was to feel good and feel excited to go to class and and so find things that make you feel excited um I in order whenever I feel maybe like I don't know like I need more I start comparing myself to my peers and I start to feel like I'm not accomplishing enough I look at the people who I started with in stand up and I've surpassed many of them uh and I'm like I could still be there uh and then I also look at like this is maybe a little bit morbid but I think about how fortunate I am just to like be born in Canada and opposed to a place where I could have trouble finding clean drinking water or I could have been uh kidnapped or uh all these different things that happened to millions of people around the world I I am not experiencing it so I try to be very grateful for having just these things I take for granted every day um and that helps me get grounded and feel just like rationalize my situation and just be like yeah no things are going pretty good yeah so you know that's really interesting because because I I I think you have a couple of in interesting cognitive tricks because I'm trying to understand like how you are the way that you are okay yeah and and because I think that there's a lot of good stuff that you say I think the problem is that like most people just it's almost like it's it's like your mind is Teflon like stuff just seems to bounce off I am very I I there's a lot of stuff I can let go really easily um that's not how it is for most people man like I think most people like things affect them like if you go to Muay Thai and you bomb on stage and I'm sure that you know stand up and stuff has has made you quite resilient but I think there are a couple of like so what I'm trying to figure out is okay for this guy like what what's going on so you can say just do it everyone says just do it everyone who does it says just do it but the problem is they don't know how they're able to just do it when the rest of the people are struggling to just do it right like there's there's no insight into like why it's easy for some and hard for others I think um I think the the the turning out of the Keeping Up Appearances like really trying to not worry about the the outside perception that has been a baseline of who I am I think has helped a lot yeah so I mean but I think that too is something that like you can say right and I'm with you but your ability to let go of appearances is in and of itself adjust doing it I'm just gonna stop thinking about what people I'm gonna stop caring about what most people can't do that yeah and and if I can just finish yeah yeah so I I think what's really interesting is you do one thing and so I'm sort of I'm digging right because what I'm I'm sort of noticing is that on the one hand you're very inspiring but on the other hand like I don't think most people can do what you do and so the question is how what is it that actually goes on under the hood that allows you to do these things and I so I want to share one thing so I thought this was really interesting which is that when you find yourself comparing to people who are better than you you actually do this cognitive thing where you go back to people that you started with and so one thing I think you're really good at that you sort of do and I don't know if this is intentional or but I think this is more duplicatable is like gaining perspective so I've noticed this myself where I felt inferior when I was in high school I felt inferior when I was in college I felt inferior when I was studying to become monk in India I didn't really feel inferior in med school I certainly felt inferior in residency when I was training to be a psychiatrist I felt inferior as a streamer and then I kind of noticed that like what I'm constantly doing I I was in line with a co-intern of mine getting coffee at like 4 30 p.m one day like in the hospital and I was like holy this guy's on a completely different level but I'm not comparing myself to the people I'm not comparing myself to the people that made me feel inferior in high school I'm not comparing myself to people in college I so what happens is I'm constantly changing the goal posts on myself yes and and one of the things that I I don't think that we really do which is a really cool cognitive trick is like any time you're feeling inferior to really ask yourself okay like do I keep on changing like it's like I moved from the amateur League to the pro league but we never really stopped to acknowledge that I used to be an amateur and even before I was in the amateur League I was on varsity and even before that I was JV and that if you really look at like if you really do Fair comparisons which is not what our mind does we do really unfair comparisons and that's also because I imagine when we make ourselves feel insecure there's a part of us that wants to work harder right because that insecurity okay I want to be better I want to be able to play in this league and so people who have imposter syndrome are actually people who are the most successful and the reason is because they're feeling insecure and then they're like working really hard and then they rise and they rise and they rise in their imposters into that cognitive piece I think is actually really important because I I do think that what who you are we can we can learn from we can start to do some of the things that you do but the life that you're describing is like is wild dude like going out and like hanging out in a cottage with 10 Comedians and and you know like really enjoying life and traveling to Greece and and going up and doing stand up and like it sounds amazing but it sounds like you're just a different human I I being fully transparent I have the same issue with the Imposter syndrome I think that's I think that's a an important part of any creative is to have the doubt because doubt will it helps you second guess and helps you tinker and helps you work a little harder see you just did it again [Laughter] no I don't know what I did like I'm like it's good it's good to yeah yeah you know I have these problems they're like good problems they help me grow as a person instead of being crushed by the weight of imposter syndrome which is what happens to most people uh-huh I don't know I don't know I don't know any way to look at it yeah I I could tell and I I mean I hopefully this you know you're a comedian so I can say this I can see that you're completely clueless like that's clear to me and I I know I have friends who struggle with uh emotional uh and mental health things and I'm very very grateful that I don't in the same way um but it just has been it's always been like that I've always one of the things I uh someone asked me when I started doing stand-up they're like were you scared about like doing bad and I said I think I was too stupid to know that it could go bad I was just like yeah I'll be fine like I just was like yeah I'll go do it it'll be fine and I just did it and it was fine and then I just kept doing it that was like kind of the my thought process going into the first one yeah dude I I I think I think everyone talks about like success stories and and you know things like that is like stories of like perseverance and intelligence and Innovation and creativity and and you know like believing in yourself and and I I think the story of success I'm hearing from you and I think it's fair to say you're you know you're you're decently successful is is you know the chase story is like how to be a quitter and how to be an idiot yeah you know the real formula to to rising in life one of my one of my buddies very smart guy um he's very much like anti-work subreddit mentality like he's like yeah I don't want to work I don't I think jobs suck which I'm not completely off with that I'm like into the whole standard idea of working in jobs I don't think is the best mindset to have um but one thing he says he's like because there's this perception that the smarter you get the harder it is to be happy um like you start to see the whole world and like you you can't turn away from all these injustices that are going on constantly any and what he says he's like maybe you're too stupid like you're so smart but too stupid to be happy like if you're so smart you should figure out how to be happy um which is a very ignorant way to look at happiness um but I think the rat it's the same thing as saying like what if it could go bad what if it can go good they're both the same sides of the same coin like everyone you're having those negative thoughts of oh this could go wrong this could go wrong this can go wrong you can look at this can go right this can go right this can go right you you can make a decision in that moment to turn the ship the other way and you can use the negative thought as the trigger like a great trigger for like getting up and going to the gym is when you have that thought I don't want to go to the gym that's when you go to the gym that's when you're like I gotta get up and do it right now using the the the procrastination as the trigger for the getting the thing done that is a little mental trick that helps you get more stuff done and you feel good when you get the stuff done okay so first thing your friend is surprisingly correct So speaking of of you know there are studies that are done on suicidality and the greater your Insight the more rapidly the faster you learn how screwed you are when you get diagnosed with something bad the more likely you are to be suicidal there's also studies that show that so if you kind of think about depression and anxiety so IQ is good at like understanding things and is powerful the problem with a lot of things like especially depression is that depression hijacks your IQ so like if you hate yourself and you're really  smart if there's some kind of emotional driver that is controlling your IQ then suddenly it's like you've got this really powerful weapon but it's like pointed in the wrong direction so there are even we have a video about like it's really interesting but you can't like logic your way out of depression in fact there's some data that actually if you're smart like you may be more prone to mental illness in some ways um so even things like creative like raw creativity objective measures of creativity are higher in people with like bipolar disorder now creative output is lower in people with bipolar disorder because they're not able to you know do this craft process kind of like I mean I have no idea if you're bipolar or not but you know the craft process and and sort of resulting in something is hard but your friend is actually not wrong there um and the other thing that I'm really curious about is like this that you're talking about once again I'm like dude I don't think that's how humans work and which is like I'm procrastinate like I don't feel like going to the gym do you get that most people just don't go to the gym I I do how do you do that what did you how did you what the man um I don't know I just like you just use it as a I have a buddy who put me onto it who was like yeah use that as a trigger and I was like okay I'll try doing that it doesn't work 100 of the time but I tried to get it to work so so what what happens there when you use it as a trigger So like um this morning uh I was like you uh I wake up and I start checking my phone and then I tell myself oh before I go I like to go for a walk first thing in the morning it's like before I go for a walk maybe I'll just look for content to react to later so I can have an excuse to keep looking at my phone and I was like No just go for a walk and so I get up I just like and then also making those things comfortable it's when I saw so I'll wear shorts and flip-flops and it's like okay it's like a less of a barrier entry even if that small barrier is putting on your shoes flip-flops are easier to put on now you're out walking moving your body and now I'm a step closer to going to the gym because going to the gym after a walk it's nice because my body's nice and warmed up from moving around a bunch um but that's yeah that's kind of that's kind of it to get it go okay I think that makes a lot of sense so I'm gonna I'm gonna unpack that a little bit and this is really great uh are you how are you feeling about this conversation by the way great yeah am I am I like moving in the wrong direction like so can I grab water really quick yeah sure and I'm gonna have to wrap in maybe about 10 minutes but but go grab water and I'll cool um what I'm gonna say I'm gonna say look this this this this guy's been standing did you guys see that that's insane he's been standing this whole time what the okay you've been standing you're not saying I've been standing yeah yeah I'm standing yeah I have like a standing desk yeah that's cool okay um I have to do the you know yeah I know the sitting is great I love the city um so here's what I'm kind of noticing so if you want to use procrastination as a trigger to action I think where you're starting is first of all being fully aware that oh crap I want to procrastinate right now really just acknowledging I do not want to do this and then so most of the time when we procrastinate we don't realize that that thought is a trigger for a particular Behavior and once you realize that it is a trigger for a behavior if you can catch it in the act you can actually deviate away and then I think the second thing that you do is that you don't anytime you're feeling lazy you don't try to force yourself to do the thing that you don't want to do you just force yourself to do anything but sinking into the procrastination so if it's like like okay I don't feel like going to the gym and I feel like pulling out my phone I'm not going to pull out my phone but I'm not going to go to the gym either and this is where I think a lot of people trip up because they try to go like a hundred percent mm-hmm and I think what what's really interesting because you're like okay I'm just going to put on flip-flops and I'm going to go for a walk because if I can dodge getting sucked into this then going to the gym is easier yeah and and so I think your story is one of being a quitter being ignorant and actually being a slacker because you don't try to go to the gym you just put on flip-flops in shorts and go for a walk so catch it in the moment and do way less than what your target is and I think the um like the way I look at those things is I have I have like my what I call my dailies like I have five things I try to do every day which is um I'm called like education so when I walk I like listen to a podcast or have like an audiobook or something going and then uh I go to the gym right make content meditate those are like the five things to do every day so do get those things going one after the other and if you can get those done in succession then you're like you're on to a killer day and then if you get them all done then you look at the to-do list after that um but if every time I kind of knowing what I need to do every day if I start scrolling or doing something else I know I'm deviating from what I need to do so it's really easy to identify the procrastination um also you can do little things to make the jobs more fun like a thing that I made the gym a lot more fun was I have a podcast that I love listening to I try to only listen to it when I go to the gym so now it's like I get excited to listen to my podcast because I'm at the gym and so now I'm making the gym more fun these are like little mental tricks and you can also just do like fake it till you make it where when you have that thing I don't want to go to the gym you tell yourself in your brain you go no I love the gym I love it it's great and like that even though it sounds so simplistic it does help like this mental trick of like no I do I like it I like it I get in shape I like the feeling feeling in shape I like working out I like getting a sweat on and you think of all the things you do really like about the gym because a lot of the time when you're procrastinating on or at least for me I find when I'm procrastinating and doing something it's not so much that I don't like doing the thing I don't like the feeling of doing something I'm required to do I don't like that homework feeling that like I have to get this done like I procrastinate on writing all the time and then every time I write I'm like I love writing I love writing jokes the feeling of coming up with a new joke is incredible I love it like the gym I can justify not liking a little bit more because there's times where you work out really hard and you feel like crap or you've injured yourself or whatever but the writing is like almost 99 of the time I'm having a good time while I'm writing um so yeah so I I think how do you get over that feeling of like requirement homework feeling I've never gone over it so because I also think it's interesting that your dailies are not is not your to-do list dailies are just the requirements that you just have to get done every day like brushing your teeth or something um but uh those like that homework feeling of doing something getting those things done how I get over those I've never gone over that feeling but I have learned to subside the feeling of homework and usually it's just getting into the thing like just doing the thing makes you feel better like going for the walk and then putting in the podcast and then sitting down to meditate like doing once you're doing the thing you don't feel the need to procrastinate in it as much once you're started yeah yeah so you really just have to go and do and also just removing barriers to entry really helps like the gym I go to is I don't know like two blocks from my front door so I leave I I literally leave in my I bring no bag just my gym attire and I walk straight into the gym and I walk straight to the thing I need to work on I don't need to go to a locker and put myself in a locker and do these things like there's I've removed a lot of barriers to me working out and that makes it a lot easier the writing it's like I don't need a notepad and a pen and blah blah blah I need my phone and that's it the meditation I just need to sit down um the walking I just need to put shoes on and I can go um the education I've made it super simple where it's a podcast it's an audio book it's whatever it's something I'm listening to that makes it really easy um what is it writing exercise uh education meditation creating content on I just like creating content usually I save to the end because then I'm like chomping at the bit to look at my phone because I love looking at my phone and then so you do that at the end of the day so it's like oh no I finally get to look at my phone and then I'm like scrolling scrolling scrolling scrolling and then to help with that so I don't get too lost in it I set timers so I know I limit myself so I don't get caught in the procrastination of making an excuse that I'm trying to find the perfect video when really now I'm just mindlessly scrolling that's really cool Jay um I I'm gonna have to get going in about five minutes ten minutes or so but do you have any questions for me or anything else you want to add before you wrap um I don't know man uh I've of you for twitch uh you can find me at little dinky news we do a lot of uh gaming content and stuff we react to a bunch of different things we just watched the Playstations or whatever press conference they just had so we were like a lot of gaming uh Centric stuff uh we play a lot of fortnite been ripping that a lot recently um but yeah no I don't think I have anything else to to throw in there I think start small uh and then grow I've had a oh and uh one thing I wanted to say was like what helps with the knowing if you're procrastinating is like being really honest with yourself like when I go for a walk sometimes I listen to nothing and I will just think about likes anything I'll just let my mind run and like some like I got on a tangent recently where like I I don't like fashion I've always kind of never been subscribing to Fashion I was like and I was like why asking myself the question why why I'm like pulling that up it's like well I feel like it doesn't add anything to a person well why do I feel like what do I feel like adds to a person and like digging deeper and deeper and that's a whole other thing but that helps you get very honest with yourself of your likes and dislikes which I think comedy has really helped because what comedy is like finding your voice is just um finding your sense of humor so I'm like super in tune with one aspect of my life which is like laughter and joy and enjoyment and that has helped me understand all other things very similar to The Book of five rings where he's like I mastered the skill of strategy and now I can learn all of their skills so if you get in tune with yourself on something you can apply that process of getting in tune to learning other aspects of your life book of five rings is Musashi yes that's cool I'm good good luck yeah it's been a while since I've read it um cool well thank you very much Chase so so uh I know you're big on Tick Tock um stream on Twitch anything live coming up or anywhere else that people can find you if they're yes I'm gonna be in Oklahoma in July um Michigan in August Austin in September and we're adding on a bunch of stuff now it looks like St Louis uh Wisconsin those are going to be added very quickly we're kind of figuring out the pieces of what the next leg of road work is going to be going into the late summer uh fall into the winter so once I know all that all that will be announced but that those states are pretty much confirmed right now cool awesome man well um good luck to you on all of your endeavors um I may try to come see you in Austin and uh you know thank you so much for sharing your perspective I think a very different conversation from what I was expecting because most of the comedians I've worked with are like train wrecks like from a mental health standpoint but I I really think it's amazing how you pivot so much um and and how you kind of you know there's so many things that I think can wear us down or cause us to almost like crack under the pressure but you seem to do a couple of things that can really help you like move in the right direction I think those are actually learnable um little cognitive tricks even this aspect of you know why asking yourself why all the way down to the center about yourself yeah um is a big part of kind of what we do in psychotherapy but I think a lot of it can be done internally as well yeah just on a walk so thank you so much for coming and good luck to you man thank you I appreciate you having me on yeah take care dude bye okay um I got a X out of this all right so that's Chase dude what on Earth this guy is insane um in his you know it's so interesting because I I found myself judging him based on his comedy I thought he was going to be like a degenerate but he's like uh Miyamoto Musashi five rings reading Mega Chad Teflon Buddha type human who uses procrastination as a trigger to motivation like what oh yeah we're gonna talk about Envy we can do that and then we'll wrap for the day okay so let's talk about Envy for a second is there a lot of emotions that we talk about and we sort of like talk about how to deal with them right there's a lot of like stuff on like shame like how do I overcome toxic shame and like anger like how do I learn to accept my anger right the one that we don't really talk about is envy and envy is like it's really crippling in a lot of ways but the tricky thing is that Envy can be good so Envy for a lot of people is fuel like I want to be that person and the tricky thing is that also when we talk about emotions we talk about them generally like okay how do I get in touch with my emotions how do I overcome my emotions how do I allow space for my emotions man we don't think about them as discrete things that have discrete strategies to deal with so there's this old text called the vishudda Maga the path of purification which is really cool because what they sort of realize is a text from the Buddhist tradition is that each emotion actually has a particular key that unlocks it there's a particular way that you can take every emotion and transform it into something positive so let's start by understanding what is envy Envy is some amount of appreciation plus ego so if you think about it like what does that mean you can't Envy something unless you appreciate it we don't envy bad things we appreciate good things right makes sense second thing is we don't appreciate all good things I mean so we don't envy all good things right so there's all kinds of people out there who have all kinds of good stuff and we don't appreciate all of the good things so Envy at its core Envy has a positive emotion there which is appreciation so if you appreciate a particular thing that is what can lead to envy but appreciation is a good thing right like to appreciate stuff is like good like that's the point of life and like I appreciate like it's good so what is it that takes appreciation and turns it into the toxic emotion of Envy it is ego so there's a really simple diagnostic trick that y'all can do and that is the next time you envy you feel Envy notice that the Envy is directed towards a person but you envy that person for a reason right so if someone let's say someone like is good looking right Envy someone's physique or someone's success I envy the person but there is an attribute of that person that I appreciate and what I really respect is that thing but the second I I make a comparison the second I embody it with a person that becomes ego because I'm over here and this person is over here and there are all kinds of things where we can see like the value of appreciation where I can look at someone and I can be inspired by them right but when I get inspired by them I'm not thinking about them I'm thinking about me I don't know if that sort of makes sense but I say like oh wow that person is is is really in shape or works really hard I'm gonna start doing that too I can do that and so the focus becomes on myself instead of the other person that's the difference between inspiration and envy but if we real really look at like where is where are our eyes pointed in Envy they are pointed at another human being and there's a comparison being made and when I'm inspired by another person my eyes are pointing at myself and there's no comparison so I'm like okay I'm gonna start doing this and so how can you take envy and turn it into appreciation or inspiration you have to remove the ego component you must remove the comparative component because the appreciation is down there right even the longing for the thing is down there but this is what's kind of tricky is that Envy can sort of like Inspire us to act but it does so like in sort of a polluting way right it's like it generates like this nuclear waste like sure it Powers our submarine but we're like generating like nuclear waste as a result so it hurts and so what you really need to do is notice the next time you envy someone ask yourself a couple of questions one is what do I appreciate about this what is the thing that I'm actually attracted to the second thing is why do I compare myself to this person why is this instead of being about the thing itself that I want to do I'm putting my identity and their identity into it and I'm drawing a comparison it is out of that comparison that the toxicity arises so take as you notice like I want to be this person right it's not that you want those things which is what you tell yourself but this is exactly why we sort of Miss it because it's not really about the things you can't Envy you can't Envy a physique you can want a physique but you can Envy a person because Envy is person-centric and to try to remove that from the equation notice wow like I'm drawing a comparison between me and them and that comparison in turn has to do with your identity so I feel a particular way about myself and now we see why you're so far from the goal because the goal is the physique this person has the physique there's a comparison the comparison why do we compare Things We compare things because we ourselves are insecure about them that's why we compare right and you may say what what do you mean by that let's just understand that for a second if you're secure about something like you don't notice it in other people right it's kind of com it's kind of weird but it's like so simple and it's so automatic that we don't even realize it that all of our comparisons are based on insecurities and so now we can see that okay the root of Envy is actually ego and ego is a defense mechanism against insecurity so when do I feel egotistical when someone threatens my intelligence and I'm afraid that maybe I'm not quite as smart as I think I am and you can look at social media and certain famous people and you just can trigger them very easily because if you you know people who are confident it's like doesn't really bother them to be criticized but when we have an insecurity and that's like that's how like kids learn how to make fun of you right like they learn where the weak points are and why do particular kids make fun in a particular way it's because they sniff out the insecurity how do they sniff out the insecurity because of the way that you react so someone makes fun of you bully makes fun of you five different ways and five uh five different days in five different ways and what do they do next week which name do they they attach to you and then everyone starts calling you that it's the thing that you react to so that insecurity as we get older we develop an ego to protect ourselves I'm not stupid you're stupid this isn't my fault this is your fault I'm the smartest person on the planet I'm the richest person on the planet I'm so successful look at me I'm a mega chat I'm in shape I make all all this money I date lots of these people I have everyone lined up everyone wants a piece of meat all ego and underneath insecurity so if you want to disable Envy notice your insecurity notice the comparison and then gravitate towards the appreciation recognize that wow this is something that I want and instead of envying that person and your eyes being over there and trying to duplicate them notice what is beyond them what is it that I'm truly appreciating and then ask yourself what can I do to get that thing that I appreciate how can I actually move towards that what's the smallest thing that I can do to move towards that which I appreciate and something revolutionary will happen which is that you'll start to move towards it and you may say but Dr K that's hard I don't I want all kinds of things and I don't move towards them and the reason for that is because so much of your cognition is caught up in Envy where does the energy of Envy get you nowhere and it occupies your mind it fills your mind it's all of this insecurity all of this ego instead of actually moving towards anything that you want and so once you remove all of this ego from the equation you'll be able to actually move towards your goals and if you pay attention to yourself you'll find that the goals that are the hardest to achieve are the ones that have your ego involved if you're not trying to impress anyone you can hang out with them very easily I can hang out with my dozen gaming buddies because I'm not trying to get any of them to fall in love with me I'm just hanging out but the second that my worth I want to be accepted by this person I don't want to be rejected ego enters the picture and all of our cognitive energy is like spiraling out of control in a completely unproductive way and so as you dismantle a envy and move towards appreciation as you step away from ego and start thinking about what can I do how can I take one step towards this thing you will actually become like more motivated you will start to accomplish more and so practice understanding and catching envy and splitting it apart into appreciation and ego and then step back from the ego and you'll start moving towards what you want make sense questions Nicolette I'm I'm INTP I'm certainly not entp myers-brigg love it okay this is beautiful great question sporb iyosh is saying what if Envy comes from something that you think you cannot have whether or not that's true brilliant question what if Envy comes from something you cannot have there's the ego it all it's all not always going to do that but that is absolutely exactly what I'm talking about why can't you have it other people can have it but you can't have it that's ego that's your identity that's exactly that's gonna you're spot on that's where it's gonna come from but that's the whole point that's how you have to disarm it because it's still the ego why can't you have it and now this is where your mind will convince you it'll come up with all of this logic and all of this data I can't be happy because dot dot dot but you can go on the internet and you can find a thousand people who are convinced that they cannot have something and you can recognize that they're wrong and you can argue with them until you're blue in the face and it's never going to make a difference because once you have an identity that you cannot have something it becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy there's no way they'll hire me for this job so you go into the job interview thinking there's no way they're going to hire you you're dejected you're not even going to try you're certainly not excited how on Earth would you get excited instead what you're doing is you're protecting yourself from the inevitable rejection and if you're afraid that you can't have something and you don't deserve it because all of these logical reasons how do you protect yourself you protect yourself by preventing excitement by preventing yourself from wanting it and if you prevent excitement and prevent yourself from wanting it you sabotage your ability to get it because when you go in for the job interview do you want the job no I cannot it hurts too much to think that I may want the job and not get it the pain of an unfulfilled desire is too much for me to handle so instead what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna stop wanting and then your life becomes numb and empty because what do you do I don't want anything so I'm gonna sit at home all day in front of the screen and maybe drink or get high from time to time beautiful question is the goal to completely get rid of your ego only if you want to become enlightened so the goal depends on the goal so for most human beings what I would recommend is that you should be in control of your ego the ego is not a bad thing we've evolved it for a reason the problem is that the ego controls us instead of the other way around right so the goal is for you to understand when the ego is active and even let it act sometimes but for you to be in control of it so the ego is supposed to protect us like I'm not egoless by any means if someone tries to steal something that is mine my ego will arise and I will let it arise right so sometimes like it's kind of weird but like you know let's say I'm in the emergency room doing like an emergency Psychiatry shift and there's someone who's like calling me names and like that's when I let my ego come out and I say hey I'm here to help you it's not okay for you to call me these things I don't deserve to be called these things I understand you're having a bad night I'm here to help you I'm working overnight and like I'm not putting my kids to bed today to help your ass and I'm gonna help you either way but the way that you're treating me is completely unacceptable I'm here because of my ethical like I have an ethical obligation which is like part of the reason I come here is to help like you but I would really appreciate it if you could treat me with some respect and if you could stop being an because we got to do this like you're not leaving and we have to figure this out and I'm going to do my duty but like it's I'm gonna do a way better job if you stop treating me like and I'm on your side the only person you're really hurting here is yourself and you're like pulling me along on the Pain Train for no reason right so ego is good and sometimes like it's a huge problem because when a lot of times when people are psychiatrically ill they're family members enable them so much no one ever ever actually sets boundaries on them and it doesn't actually help them like I was working with someone once who had ADHD and they were in this relationship and like you know they had difficulty doing things because they have ADHD and like that's fair right that's what we're here to help you with but at the same time like they have to do their part like it doesn't change the fact that in the relationship their partner has to do everything because they're too disorganized so now the partner is doing the work of two people and is it the person with adhd's fault that they have ADHD does it objectively make things harder it's not their fault they have ADHD and it's not it does make things objectively harder but who is it making harder for makes it harder for everyone and yet this person is not engaging in treatment they're not using planners and organization and all this kind of stuff so they're not accepting responsibility for the circumstance is your life hard yes but just because it's hard doesn't mean that you shouldn't be working harder at it please do a video on your struggles Day in the Life okay I will do those things yeah you know no no saying my cure for Envy is fantasized having the thing in Daydream until I can't know more Ludwig does the same thing we had a conversation with Ludwig where he was like yeah I just fantasize about it and then it kind of disappears and I'm like okay that's cool ah how do you stop once you have to give in to your ego what a great question last question then I gotta run so you don't give in to your ego giving in to your ego is letting the dog off leash you don't give in to the ego you just take it for a walk and you're still in control but you don't let it off the leash giving in to your ego is a problem it helps to mitigate the pain absolutely that's the big tragedy in life is that we are so stuck mitigating the pain of life that we can't move towards anything right and now the problems see there's a there's a basic problem in in society today which is that in the past if you had some sort of pain that was a signal for you to change your life to fix the pain so if we look at like animals if an animal is hungry there's only one thing an animal can do to get rid of that hunger if we are socially ostracized as human beings there it hurts a lot but then that hurt motivates us to change our behavior and reintegrate into society this is why we have forgiveness as a concept because people feel bad and even if you screw up there's an Avenue towards reintegration now the problem is that when we feel pain you have a way to disarm that pain without actually making a change in your life this you can take the pain away without changing the circumstances that cause the pain and this is how we get stuck because it used to be that hey like if I'm sitting and I'm uncomfortable I have to move and then I will feel better if I'm hungry I have to eat but when it comes to this psychic pain I'm ashamed of myself I'm a failure I'm filled with Envy I'm angry what do we do with those things when you're angry what do you do you you downvote something instead of actually making a change in the world and when you actually make a change in the world you feel good about yourself and you help other human beings but now because of this we can make the pain go away without actually changing our circumstances and then we end up stuck in life because we haven't built anything and now we get stuck in this cycle of taking the pain away constantly and so our life is not something that we live it is a constant process of pain numbing and it's because this has short-circuited why we have pain in the first place pain is a signal to change we don't need to anymore and this is why mental this is why we have a mental health crisis because no one has to fix their lives anymore you just numb it so easily spectral is right it's like a pacifier brilliant brilliant okay we gotta run thank you all very much for coming Che is a mega chat not what I was expecting but that's what's fun about this and I think what's really cool about like talking to people is that we can discover that so this is the last thing I'll leave y'all with here's the last thing we go through life and life is hard the thing is each and every one of us learn certain tricks to make life better or tolerable but the problem is we never share our knowledge with each other because we don't even realize what we're doing the automatic things that make you good at life you're not even aware of but the more that we talk to people the more we're just going to discover different tricks and I encourage y'all to pay attention to these conversations and think like oh this person is different but like most people can become somewhat similar if they change the way that they act or the way that they think if one person is in shape and you're not in shape you can do that and you can do that for the mind too this is the big thing that we don't understand this is what the yogis figured out is the path to Enlightenment is like something that anyone can walk that's what meditation is and so if you want to figure out how to live life listen to conversations with other people and try to figure out how is this person able to do this and what part of this can I duplicate because each and every one of this is what I've seen is like every patient I've worked with will figure out some things on their own and if we pull all that knowledge together we can literally craft a life that is like perfect and you could say oh Dr K like you can't say that there's a such thing as perfect life like oh my God no like what the  where did we get off on the idea that we can can't craft a perfect life well because we haven't been able to that's because we haven't been working together and if we work together I think we can get pretty damn close so stay stick with it good luck and thanks for showing up today adios everybody
