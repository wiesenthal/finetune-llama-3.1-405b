today I want to talk to you all about how to stop taking things [Music] personally so as we go through life often times people will tell us things that we don't want to hear and we take it incredibly personally they'll say things like oh bro like don't take it so personally man like it's not really you or if we're going through a breakup like oh my God it's not you it's me and it's infuriating and when I work with my patients one of the most important things that has trans formed their lives is to teach them how to stop taking things personally when you take things personally it creates bad feelings and bad outcomes and if we can learn how to stop taking things personally which ironically means accepting responsibility those two are at opposite ends of the spectrum as I hope to show you what we'll discover is that it will help you feel better and do better now I was even debating making this video and I talked to about it about my team because I think while this concept is so transformation it is also really really hard to explain so when I work with my patients it's like at some point they get this like light bulb that goes off above their head like a a flip a switch flips in their mind and then suddenly they get it and it's really awesome but it's really hard for me to try to explain this so I I think it's really stressing my abilities as a teacher so please try to stay with me please try to get what I'm saying because I think it'll really help a lot and if that doesn't work out remember it's not you it's me so let's start by actually looking at narcissism which if we really stop and think about it for a second taking things personally is a feature of narcissism right so I want youall to think about the people in your life that you know who are narcissistic thankfully one of the interesting positive sides for the skyrocketing rate of narcissism that we see due to things like the internet is now at least everyone has seen a narcissist and maybe you are a little bit narcissistic it's what the internet and social media is doing to us we all watch videos on the internet because we want to change the problem is that even though we keep watching them we don't necessarily change I want to talk to you all about our coaching program and if you're not interested just jump forward 20 seconds and get straight to the video but if you're someone who is ready to actually make change if you want to see outcomes in 6 8 12 weeks if you guys are struggling with problems like career stuff burnout stuff social skills low self-esteem if you're trying to struggle to motivate yourself to actually act that's what we built a coaching program for check out the link in the description below to see how coaching can help you and now on to the video so here is a narcissist I guess they are green and what happens is let's say that you are over here and you say to the narcissist hey I don't like this thing that you do right so let's say that you have a narcissist who always shows up drunk they are drinking all the time this is a bottle of beer I it looks like lipstick I look look y'all don't watch me for the art okay so let's say they they always show up drunk and you tell the narcissistic person hey I don't like this thing that you are doing and how does the narcissistic person respond the narcissistic person is like oh my God I don't know what I can do to make you happy I've tried everything I do everything they take it so personally right they're like I've tried everything I don't know how to make you happy like this is a relationship that I can't win in they play the victim card and instead of focusing on this problem over here they take things personally this is a defect of them as a person and if it becomes a defect of them as a person they don't actually fix this right that's like what happens with the narcissistic defense mechanism is that they start playing the victim and then they never actually have to create their behavior they start saying all this crap they make you feel guilty and they like they never actually change because they don't understand that the problem is over here and instead you know they sort of make the problem over here and this is exactly the problem with taking things personally now let's flip things around so let's say that you are going through a breakup with someone and the person says it's not you it's me and if they say the problem isn't you it's me and you take that personally where do you think the problem is the problem is over here right and you're like oh my God like what did I do wrong like I knew I'm pathetic I I know that you're seeing someone else like whatever kinds of negative thoughts happen but you internalize the problem that's what it means to take something person personally now this creates a huge problem because sometimes you're actually right and there is a problem within you but even in this case you don't know what that problem is right because they're not saying this is the reason I'm breaking up with you that there's an external reason over here they're actually saying that the problem is not you at all so even in the event that they the problem does lie with you you still don't know what it is and you can't really take corrective action there's another devastating possibility which is that this person is actually being honest that they are going through some stuff in their life right now where they're not ready for a relationship there really is nothing wrong with you and then what happens is you feel bad and the other problem is that there is no corrective action to take see if you're dating someone and they no longer want to be with you because of they're that they're going through there's nothing you can do to actually fix that so there's no corrective action so there's no improvement that you can make but you feel bad and then you will further rack your brain thinking what is wrong what is wrong what is wrong what do I need to fix what do I need to fix what do I need to fix and this in turn leads to low self-esteem which in turn leads to more narcissistic defense mechanisms right there's not actually anything to fix because the problem isn't within you but the moment that you take it personally you beat yourself up the problem is you you don't really know what to fix and this becomes a huge problem so what is the alternative so this is what I work with with my patients which is is what we actually want to do is accept the appropriate responsibility let's say that I go for an interview at Google and there is some kind of Le code interview okay so the skill is lead code and then here is some prospective employer I go to the interview and they say sorry you don't get the job now in this situation I have two choices I can take things personally oh my God I knew I wasn't C cut out for this I really suck at this like oh my God like you take it personally right the defect is within you it is a part of your identity it is an identity defect and this is exactly how narcissists feel by the way right so they feel like there isn't oh no it's not you just don't like me it's not that you don't like how I always steal your  or I'm always drunk or I have no compassion for you or I don't listen to what you say or how I prioritize all my needs above yours it's none of that stuff you just dislike me I can't win right because what they see is they see the problem is over here and I want youall to think about this if you were a shitty human what is the solution to that if the problem is in your identity you cannot change your identity it is not actionable information so interestingly enough if you go through an interview and you don't get hired and some people will take this personally the defect is in here but this is not actionable so when I work with my patients what I try to help them do is see what the actual defect effect is right what we actually want to do is externalize the problem from ourselves when we externalize the problem from ourselves we open ourselves up to accepting responsibility and we also create a path of action the reason I didn't get hired is not because I am a screwed up human being the reason I did not get hired I know this is shocking is because there is a insufficiency of the skills that I presented and I want youall to think about that right that's literally what not taking things personally is it is not the problem isn't me it is there's this thing that I need to work on even in the case of a breakup right if someone says I need someone who's more emotionally available and if you're not careful you will take that personally and you'll be like oh my God how am I ever like there's nothing I can do about that this is who I am right this is who I am it's deterministic it's fatalistic and it's exactly how narcissists talk they never actually address their problem s which is why so going back to the narcissist right if I have a problem Behavior over here right like drinking and someone says this is the problem but the narcissist places the blame over here they take things personally then what that means is they never actually correct this this continues again and again and again the behavior continues forever so the more that they take things personally the less they actually fix things in their life which propagates the cycle and is what creates the life of a narcissist which is that no one ever likes me I don't know what I can do differently I've tried so hard everyone hates me and then they ignore their behaviors over and over and over again so now what we can do with some something super cool we can use the blindness of a narcissism to shed light on our own lives and when we take things personally we are literally doing the same thing here is you and here is your behavior and if you see the problem over here instead of see the problem over here because we as human beings are not good at seeing problems in two places we tend to look at just one problem right oh yeah it's not you it's me or I'm the problem in the relationship or you're the problem in the relationship shared responsibility is scary and way more complicated so what this does is when we see th things over here we do not see what is in here and then we can't take corrective action so instead what we want to do and this is what's revolutionary for my patients is when I help them see that you are actually totally fine as a human being it is this behavior that you need to change and what I tend to find with my patients is when they start to realize this not only do they feel better right because now I'm not a poos over here and they can take corrective action and this is what taking responsibility means so you can take corrective action and then as these problems start getting better their relationships start improving their performance starts improving everything gets better and they feel better because they don't feel like a POS because they recognize that the problem is outside of myself if the problem is outside of myself there is a clearer way to fix it so how do we go about doing that so literally what I want you all to do is to anytime you take something personally I want you to try to remove yourself from the equation so in try to practice a little bit of empathy put yourself in the other person's shoes and ask yourself what do they actually see what is the behavior what are the words what what is the visible expression it is not identity right cuz they have no sense of like who your identity is like that's not a thing that they can see there are going to be certain things that you are doing saying certain ways that you're acting that the other person is going to perceive so the first thing that you need to do is look through the eyes of the other person which by the way is the exact deficit that narcissists have right so even if we look at evidence-based treatment for narcissism one of the treatments is something called mentalization based therapy and in mentalization based therapy literally what we're training these people to do is see things through other people eyes so ask yourself if you get something that makes you feel bad and you're taking it personally you feel like a POS look at the other person's perspective and ask what are they seeing now the other thing that you can do is literally ask them what are you seeing that I'm doing what are the behaviors that bother you what are the words that bother you like help me understand so what we want to do is try to externalize our perception and look at ourselves or look at what they see the next thing that we want to do is try to focus on when when when you say I am a p o s and you take things personally that is going to result in once again certain manifestations so what are the manifestations is it that I don't text people back fast enough is it that what is what are the manifestations of being a POS and as you examine the manifestations you're going to start to discover things over here and then comes the most important step is once you start to isolate these things and this is the beautiful thing they don't even need to be right right so a lot of my patients will get hung up what if what if I'm wrong about this right what if I'm wrong about let's say this person says I'm not invested in the friendship and I ask them okay what what does this person see well they text me and I don't text them back and then my patients will ask well what if I'm wrong what if that's the wrong thing and that's not really the problem that that is in the relationship this is where I say I don't care what what do you how do you feel about texting people back more frequently like do you think that would improve your life in some way do you think that that could help may help your other relationships as well so as you take this as you take this approach you're going to start to isolate these kinds of things and then you're going to start working on them this is what we mean by accepting responsibility you're going to start to fix those actions and the Beautiful Thing is as you start to fix those actions you separate things from your ego as you separate things from your ego and you start to take the right action you remove bad feelings and bad outcomes and if you stop and really think about it right so we're going to end by talking about the narcissists what is it that the narcissist never does they never change their  Behavior they never change what they say they keep on insisting that the problem is within them but the whole reason that it's so infuriating is because they do not focus on the things that are outside of them and so if you want to take things less personally it will help you so much practice a little bit of empathy look at what other people are seeing and you don't get to answer with they're seeing a loser that is not something you can see right even in the case of a loser what is a loser maybe it's someone who's overweight maybe it's someone who doesn't wear properly fitting clothing maybe it's someone who doesn't it doesn't groom themselves properly boom action item number one action item number two action item number three so literally look at things through other people's eyes look at things look at the manifestations of what you feel makes you take things personally and then focus on those things it'll improve your life and it'll proove the way that you feel last thing is that there are a couple of other things involved with this things like ego and stuff like that we have other sources that we talk about the relationship of what activates the ego because taking things personally is a narcissist defense mechanism there's certain meditation techniques and things like that check out our videos on ego we actually have a resource pack that's all about ego and confidence and then we also have things in in stuff like Dr K's guide to meditation um the trauma guide and then the last thing that is very very helpful is when we have trouble seeing things the way that they are this is really what our coaching program excels at so the reason that their outcomes are so good is because they are they're very good at being an external lens for you right so if you're having trouble putting yourself in someone else's shoes or seeing what they see that's exactly what a coach is for they're there to look at things from the outside and share that information with you in an actionable way so depending on what y'all are interested check out more stuff thanks for making it to the end of the video and let us know if this actually makes sense to you or not so is it you or is it me or does it work out or let us know oh [Music]
