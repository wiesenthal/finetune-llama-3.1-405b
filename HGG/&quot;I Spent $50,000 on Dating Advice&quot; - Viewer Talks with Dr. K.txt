all right my friend welcome how's it going good dude how are you I'm great um and what do you go by my friend fish ish yeah um and so what are we talking about today ish uh we're talking about um dating [Music] I guess I just wanted to share my perspective on um yeah I guess like somebody who's been sold this idea that you know if you do XYZ then like women are gonna flock to you um I guess I spent the large part of basically my whole life feeling like there's something wrong with me and I need to fix myself and I've been on this like decade long journey of like fixing myself I'm like fixing one thing after the other after the other after the other and I'm like now I'm like 32 and I'm still like lonely and I'm still single and I'm just like confused and I've tried literally everything under the sun to fix things externally and now I'm at a place where I'm like maybe the problem is not external it's okay that's where I'm at okay um well I mean I how can I say this my first thought is like that sounds tiring exhausting yeah what's that like it's like this uh constant like internal drive to be uh enough and just trying to do everything possible to just be enough and yeah like I wake up every day and I'm just like what can I fix today like why am I not enough why am I still lonely I feel like I have a lot of things in life that um you know I have a lot of things going for me and I just can't it kind of externally I feel like yeah I can see why I have a lot of things going for me but internally I still feel like a lot of like self-loathing and a lot of um yeah I just I I just don't have a sense of self like of self-worth um regardless of all these external accomplishments that I've been able to have in my life like it kind of just means nothing because all I really want is like intimacy and connection and I just don't have that in my life and just confused as to how to like find that yeah dude I'm sorry you're in that situation I'm sorry I'm grinning you just seem like such an amazing dude thank you and um I guess that's part of I guess that's part of why I'm confused because um I guess um when I share like my struggles with dating or whatever to people I guess that I get invalidated because they're like well you're so handsome and you're so like intelligent you're like so funny and like they let's rattle off all these things about me and I'm like I get it I see it cognitively like intellectually maybe if I wasn't myself I'd be like okay why is this guy struggling with dating but I guess I'm just carrying a lot of Shame and things inside of me which make me unable to access feeling of like I'm worth something so it's just been confusing to me okay is it okay if I just start off by like asking you a couple questions about your background and it sounds like you've been on this journey for 10 years can we learn a little bit about that like sure what what have you been up to like it sounds like you fixed a lot of stuff externally yeah what did you fix and how how uh I guess I think the things that's that was plaguing me since childhood was like social anxiety so um like I had to move out of my parents home like maybe like 10 years ago I moved countries and you're like one person in the country I moved to and I kind of wanted to start this journey of like you know being independent and like things for myself and yeah so social anxiety was the first thing I fixed and I guess found self-improvement self-help and just started reading book after book after book and consuming YouTube and blah blah blah and I guess a lot of that was like mental masturbation but also some of it was like I put into action certain things I guess like exposing myself to things I'm scared of like progressively overloading and to the point where okay like I can now shrink a coherence sentence without having panic attacks and like I can now talk to people without like you know feeling like intense physical Sensations and and then after that I was like okay um I'm like ish can I jump in for a second what does it feel like to say that right now yeah what does it feel like to talk about your progress honestly I I feel proud of myself and I don't think I've ever felt that before and it's been recent that I'm like actually noticing that I have a lot of things to be proud of so there's a big difference between having a lot of things to be proud of and being proud of them yeah sure and where are you right now yeah I I have a lot of things to be proud of like because I can make a list of things but I can't feel can't feel it but so when I was asking you about you know what you've accomplished did you feel some pride at the time probably not because I was just like they're still a lot of things wrong with me so I've got to keep going keep going I'll keep fixing myself it's just like okay our social anxieties ticked off the list now I need to like go to the gym I've got to get ripped okay got it like in a good body going down that path and then like I got to make money and then going down that path and then it's like I gotta start a business and I'm going down that path and it's like all these different things that like I'm just like okay how can I I'm just being sold that idea that like money looks status like get all these things and be the most high value man all that [ __ ] and it's just like doing all of that and thrown off feeling like I'm valuable and it's just weird what are you feeling right now I actually don't know what I'm feeling right now okay so uh you said that then you started working on the gym right and it sounds like you got in shape and then and what was that ex experience like for you again I was I think I was just doing it for not for myself but for like external validation or been sold I guess just being like Oh like if I get into shape once I get into shape then I can be worthy of like women or like worthy of respect or whatever um so even though I was like a cop like getting into shape it just didn't feel like again it was I was just like I need to get bigger I need to like lose more body fat and yeah I just just felt like there was a chore I just felt like I don't even know why I'm doing this but apparently I have to be a high value man that's what they do so yeah okay um and then what about the the whole making money career Stuff how to can you tell me a little bit about that yeah um so I mean I gone into programming I've been into programming since the young age so I never really thought much about like what I wanted to do it's just something that I just fell into um and yeah just kind of just kept going and I just kept like chasing money even though there was a certain point where I was like I don't even enjoy this but because I was just I guess um pretty depressed and like I just didn't know like I don't really care I just wanted to just kind of survive but um there was this like lucrative aspect of it where I was just like oh I can just keep I think making more money and more money and more money and then the my whole like uh I guess intention to make money was to like fix myself so I could like make money and then like figure out how to fix myself even more so like that was pretty much why I wanted to make money to like figure out what's wrong with me and like throw money at that and yeah kind of like got to a place where I'm like in the top percentage of like income earners in the country and like that student feel like anything because I just still felt broken inside I'm still like none of this [ __ ] means anything and I guess the more money I made the more like negative emotion I felt because I was like convincing myself that if I made more than like I could be happier or like I could like spend money on things to fix myself and and then it just became like this thing where um yeah I was just used like spending money to get rid of this these negative emotions and and develop yeah and keep going yeah just develop like I guess like addictions to things like buying random stuff that I don't need and like just uh again like the addiction to like self-improvement self-help just like learning buying courses and like paying for like mentorship and coaches and blah blah blah and like yeah um and and what has that experience been like what are you feeling now I just feel uh I just feel like it's just like kind of ridiculous for me like just looking back at it like everything that I kind of did I just feel it's ridiculous yeah what's ridiculous about it I don't know I just I just wish like at the start of this journey someone just told me like I should just go to therapy and just spend money on therapy and just like do that and I think I would have been all right and have you tried therapy I have yeah um I again like that that whole journey was um like I didn't have great experiences with like early on um like exposure it's like mental health professionals so like I would like seek it out and also where I live like there's like a shortage of mental health professionals so like it's kind of like I've seen like even like when I'm in like a really depressed state like even picking up the phone making phone calls difficult so like even asking for help or admitting that I need help was like really difficult and then I got over that step and I like asked for help and then be like oh like the waiting list is like eight months so like we'll put you on the waiting list and I'll be like okay like I guess I just I need to fix myself then like I can't rely on someone else so so it'd be like in and out of trying to seek professional help and then being like Oh like let's try like a spiritual route and I actually let's try self-help books and then I guess I would go to like mental health professionals and then get diagnosed with a bunch of different things um and then I'd get like medicated and then I'd try like a cocktail of medications and then some would work some wouldn't work some would be like effective short term and then some would be give me side effects and then like I would just keep trying that over the years like okay maybe maybe this diagnosis is right maybe I can try this mood stabilizer you try really hard don't you I try really hard yeah I'm curious who can you rely on myself I'm seeing that um so and and can you tell tell us a little bit about kind of this like the mentorship throwing money at the problem what did that look like and what was that like for you um well the first five years was just kind of like I guess mental masturbation like just I would have like this did you say mental masturbation or Mentor masturbation mental masturbation A-L yeah okay and what does that mean that just means like I guess um spending money on things and like I guess buying courses online like for example like how to pick up woman or some something like that or like how to Build A Drop Shipping Company like just buying these things and like going through them but not doing anything with it okay and that would be like first five years of just doing that and I guess it was just it serves some like this intellectual curiosity of like not even intellectual curiosity but I guess um feeling like I was improving myself with like knowledge like learning stuff not doing anything with it and then the last five years was kind of like okay like the the problem that I wanted to fit now was like loneliness it's like how do I fix that and then um there's one half internet which is like invalidating my loneliness and then there's certain pockets of the internet we're like I know exactly how you feel I know I know I know how to fix it and that Center like the world of like dating coaching and like pick up artistry and um yeah kind of like I knew that like some of the stuff was shady you know and I knew like maybe this was not helpful but I was curious about it and I was like lonely I was like didn't really have any other Alternatives options so I explored that and um again like trying different things um I'd go to like boot camps and then I would like learn certain things and then that'd be the intellectual part of me which is like oh this is this is not working like and maybe there's like another approach that like do like multiple approaches and like compare all of them and then like it would just it's just like a mess so it's kind of like I've just learned like had this database of like information in my head of like I guess this problem of like loneliness like solving my dating issues and now it's like realizing it's full of bunch of [ __ ] and I'm just trying to unlearn everything that I've learned okay essentially and and can you tell me so you mentioned earlier that there was like you know a lot of investment without application and in terms of like the dating stuff and relationship stuff I mean have you have you tried to apply it or is that sort of remained somewhat kind of theoretical in the database yeah so in the last five years I've been applying it and what's that been like it's it's kind of just been um what it's been like is like I kind of learned to create this like mask of like how to present like project these like qualities of myself and project like a false confidence and project like bravado um and I was like attracting women and I was like sleeping with a lot of women um and I thought like that would like increase my self-worth so I finally like damn I used to be an InStyle now I'm getting like delayed a lot um but then the thing was like I felt like even more lonely and isolated because now I've learned that like the real me whoever that is is unattractive and like women only like this this mask that I'm putting on and and I'm I'm happy that like I don't get too much too deep into that like I learned like I guess after a certain period of like doing this over and over again like the first time was cool the first time of like implementing this thing and like getting laid was cool but then like you just keep doing it it's just like at what point like and how many women are like at what point will like become confident or will I like increase my self-worth so um yeah so I kind of learned that like the mask was attractive and um I wasn't whoever I was and like I guess now in the last few years I've been slowly trying to lower that and be myself and be vulnerable and um maybe nowadays like in the past year or so it's been over correcting in the other way which is like maybe I'm like too vulnerable like overshadowing too much and that's causing people to be like yo that's too much so it's just confusing what can you give us an example of that an example of what over sharing in people like yo bro that's too much that's just in my head but I guess there was um like a woman that I went on a date with maybe yeah uh the end of last year and um I really thought connected to her more than any other girl that have been on a date with in the last few years and at this point I've been on like almost at least 100 dates and a lot of them have been first dates and I don't get many second dates or third dates um but anyways like so I went on a date with this girl and I guess we would talk talking about like childhood traumas and stuff on like a first date which is I don't know if that was like trauma bonding or that's like whatever um so in hindsight it kind of felt too intense too soon and like she ended up ghosting me and I guess that was like um that was damaging to me because I I guess like I was like okay I've lowered this mask and I finally revealed myself and still I get like ghosted and I'm just make I don't know what else to do um it's like she's rejected the real me and so like it takes me a while to like recover from those situations dating experiences like I would like go back and work on myself for like a few months and I'd like you know get in this really good state of like my routine journaling meditation going to the gym and like yoga and like I just feel like super good about myself and I'd be like yes I'm ready to date and I'll go on a date and then I would just not hear from a girl your ghost did after the first date and then I'd be like oh [ __ ] this and then it would just be another kind it's just like the cycle that just like never ends I think we're seeing a little bit of lag yes I think we're fine um so what's your understanding of why there aren't many second dates or third dates that's the question that I I can't answer um and I guess this is like the people that know the answer is like the dating coaches or like and then each dating coach would have their own like interpretation of why that is and then one would have their own methodology and formula of like how to run a date and like this is what to do is what not to do and what to say it's not what to say and then another dating coach would have a different opinion and um like honestly I don't know um and and it's bemusing to a lot of people when I express it um and the only people that would know is like the woman that I go on dates with and I sometimes I like something I'm doing recently is like asking for feedback um I guess yeah you have to take that with a lot of salt because uh people don't want to hurt your feelings and I think sometimes some of the feedback has been good like I guess things like oh like you weren't making enough eye contact or like uh the date felt like an interview and I'm like okay cool I can improve those things and then other times has been vague like I don't I don't feel a romantic connection which is weird because the woman that said that to me like just to me on the day like she initiated the kiss and stuff like that so it's just weird and then the the last girl I went on a date with like um we were like met Our dating app she was like flirting with me and she initiated me to get off the app and then like flirting or week over text I asked her out went on date and then I thought the date went really well love to see you again she's like yeah I'd love that too and then I text her the next day or the day after I'd be like hey um when when you're down to like hang out again and then I don't hear from her for a few days and then she's like hey so I've just been thinking um I'm just not into dating at the moment but um I think you're a really inspirational guy and I'd love to be friends with you um I'd love to hang out with you against friends and friend zone so I'm just like yeah so then that first time that's happened to me but it's kind of like I'm an inspirational guy which is the biggest bad kind of compliment I've ever received but like uh so yeah confused and that's kind of like what prompted me to like express myself and just being like I don't know what's going on but I guess now that I've um kind of explode therapy again and I think I finally found like a therapist that I click with and a form of therapy that I resonate with and I think the answer for now the working answer is complex PTSD which kind of like leaks out in ways that people can detect and that is why I yeah can't seem to form relationships or get second dates Beyond just like the initial uh this guy's attractive this guy's amazing on paper but then something not right like what's not maybe that's a story in my head as well that people can detect I don't know should I have kind of a weird question yeah sure do you protect other people from yourself yes what do you think that's a help me understand I don't even know what the [ __ ] the question meant what did but you have an answer and you seem pretty confident I have an answer yeah yeah what do you mean by that I protect people from my darkness in that I have Suicidal Thoughts all the time I have like great dark emotions that come out of nowhere and I have no idea what they're about where they come from I guess the diagnosis that I've received for that as a bipolar one bipolar II bipolar three cyclothymia and all of those didn't really make sense so it's kind of like I would have phases where all of a sudden I'd go from like cheerful and like happy to just like this deep dark depression for no reason and I protect myself uh to protect other people from that because I don't I feel like I have a lot of friends I have good friends I'm grateful and I have family people I can rely on trust to talk to about these things but it's like a heavy burden for them and to like put on them all the time be like so that's that's I protect people from that okay so let's ask a couple more questions so let's say you meet someone and you really like them should they date you yes or no good what's the yes what's the no uh the yes is I think um think I'm kind I think I'm uh I think I'm curious I I make I'm really interested in people getting to know people um I will text you back um I will organize dates and I'm down to do romantic [ __ ] and I people a woman complain about emotionally unavailable men but like I'm emotionally over available so like I'm here if you want to talk about emotions I'm here um yeah I guess makes me dateable sure um I think there are many things about you that are very dateable thank you um uh no what makes me Undateable is yeah mental health and my emotional instability and yeah just just this feeling of Terror that's like just takes over me sometimes and just uh unsure why or what that's about and I guess there'd be moments where when I'm with a woman and we're on a date and then they'll be like what's wrong are you okay and I'll be like I I would have to lie about that sometimes so I I don't myself no what's wrong I just the only explanation I have is this certain situations trigger memories from childhood and like that's why I guess I get like emotional flashbacks or whatever I just learned that term a couple days ago but I guess that's what's happening and um becoming more and more aware of these things seemed like a good guy is sure you a good guy I think so yeah so like let's say you liked someone is it a good idea for them to date you they have the emotional um bandwidth to handle my intensity and if they are empathic enough to like support me on just yeah just whatever's going on in my head which very confused by sometimes do you test them not consciously okay what but I totally get that what do you think unconsciously yay nay probably okay because I mean I I had kind of one thought which is that so you seem competent right like you seem like you learn things and like you know how to improve things and you kind of like you're you're very good at I don't mean this in like a dating way but like playing the game right so you know how to like move towards you could you can put afford a lot of intentionality and effort and get to where you want to go and so you've done that over and over and over again except for this one thing which then kind of begs the question one is oh my God I can't get to where I want to go this is the one uh problem that's unsolvable or that sounds kind of weird maybe you're actually just as good at this as you are at everything else and where you want to go with this is exactly where you're winding up what do you think about that help me understand that last spot like yeah it's kind of bizarre and I I think there's a part of me that wonders are you like so kind that when you go on a date with someone and if you really like them like you want to protect them from having a relationship with you sometimes yeah so I mean I wonder if some of this is just like the reason you have difficulty getting second and third dates is because you're a very effective communicator and you kind of like know how to keep that from happening not saying it doesn't hurt I'm not saying that consciously you intend otherwise but it just makes me wonder what do you think when you say effective Communicator um and I don't want that uh what do you mean by that yeah uh so so so I'm I'm kind of like I think there's a lot more that we can talk about I don't know that this is spot on but so when there's someone like ish think for don't think too much about this question right like should someone date you gives it a good idea sometimes good right so so that that shows the work that you've put in but that it took some work to get to sometimes right yes and you were like the and so I there's something there's a part of me that's like I I kind of I can see a really tricky situation I don't know if it's actually what's happening where the more that you connect with a girl the more that you actually want them the more that you care about them the more you realize you know what you're probably off better off with someone else and I don't think it's conscious but I think there's It's tricky because if you're like genuinely a good person and you genuinely care about people and you try to protect them like the best solution is like don't date me does that resonate with you at all I think so I think either at a subconscious level yeah I think if I'm like yeah I think the woman that I was talking about that I really connected with last time she expressed to me that like she used to date like a famous musician or something and like that really triggered me because I was like what is she doing on a date with me or she can like literally date anybody that was one of my first thoughts and then I guess after the date during the date we were talking about like gender norms and stuff and like I I noticed that she said that I was like she noticed I noticed she said something like I like I like initiating things sometimes so then at the end of the day she's like a lot like I had a great time and then like you know it was it was an amazing day and um I was like um oh maybe you should initiate the second day like maybe maybe you should plan the second day and um he was like yeah I'd love that and it like text me and I think yeah for four days like I didn't text her because I was expecting her to set up the day and text me and maybe that was a way for me to protect myself against getting hurt getting rejected and maybe subconsciously I was like don't date me I yeah I mean I I'm not it's an interesting idea I that just seemed there's so many other variables there I so so for like second dates and third dates what happens after that I haven't gone many second dates what happens after your first date um most often it's just like um I would text them again like if I hey love to see you again I had a good time and either I'd get ghosted uh or I would um just be like hey I wasn't feeling it or just some variation of just some pleasantry and then most recently friend zone which is like a new one um and yeah do you have fun during dates sometimes a lot of sometimes yeah honestly like I think I think the because I would say like the first 20 or 30 dates that I've been on in my life like it was really like exposure therapy for me like I'm just doing this to like I'm socially anxious so I just want to like literally just sit here and like have like a five minute conversation then a 10 minute call I was doing that right so it's like my flight of flight response was just like triggered during dates and then wow that's really impressive dude thank you that you could do that that sounds really hard yeah thank you so I guess my early dating experiences were just that like exposure therapy um and like I would I would say that I wasn't really having all that much fun because I was just like in this like hyper Vigilant state um and recently my dating experiences have just been like I guess going through this the toxic dating pickup stuff would be like getting an outcome so I'd be like the outcome is getting laid like the whole thing is and I guess it makes sense for a marketing perspective because it's like do this course and you'll get laid like there's an outcome it needs to have an outcome was when buying to it so it would be like yeah I'm going on these dates and I'm doing this like Playbook of like things to do things to say and like how to like escalate physically and then like how long to spend on a day before you like invite the girl home and then you know like do this and and like have sex like this and then just what it's like this whole formula and I'm like doing it going through the motions and I'm just like this is just stupid but like at the same time I don't really know this this is the only thing that kind of like Works quote unquote so I'm just like let's just keep doing this and uh more do it more do it more MTF I realized like I wasn't really having fun but at least I was getting late that's better than like jerking off so um but I realize I'm just like masturbating with another person so it actually didn't make me feel any better yeah I think that's very insightful how are you feeling now I don't I don't really know honestly I feel a lot of different things but I don't really know if there's one thing I can pinpoint yeah what are you feeling what are the different things I feel I feel like this is like kind of surreal that I'm talking to you like that's probably like the overwhelming feeling it's like like discovering you and just like kind of like fanboying over you and I'm like now I'm talking to you it doesn't feel real um that's kind of like yeah probably the main thing I'm feeling and why is it well we got we gotta get past that I mean you know I guess we're lag Spike for a second um I was gonna say like we gotta we gotta you know get past that get to the actual stuff like okay sure I mean which I I guess maybe I'm not helping but I I don't yeah okay so can I think for a second maybe more than a second-ish do you have friends who are women I not in real life but I have relationships with my cousins I have pretty good relationships and they're a woman okay and um it sounds like you had somewhat of a rough childhood or something right because you mentioned cptsd yes um are you comfortable telling us about the impact of that you don't have to go into detail but I'm curious like you know what so you said that 10 years ago you started this journey of fixing yourself and what I'm curious about is where did you get the idea that you're broken um yeah I guess just emotional verbal physical abuse from growing up um feeling a little bit like not a little bit but like body just more fear as well um learning that like my face is deformed in some way I'm picking that up from yeah people around me um uh being bullied and just being feeling like I'm just quiet and I don't talk much and that means there's something defective about me overwhelming that's can't quite a felt also like I like a black sheep of the family just this weird kid in the corner doesn't say much um doesn't have much to say just hyper Vigilant I think yeah I think I think the effects of all of that is just hyper vigilance like I didn't I don't really feel safe um I was always on on edge on guard like and people pleasing is another effect like being feeling responsible for other people's emotions and feeling like I'm responsible for anything like it's my fault I'm a bad person and yeah it's interesting how you can articulate it so well but that doesn't help very much does it no what are you feeling now uh I feel like um no actually like what I said about like the fan blowing stuff what I feel is like I feel like being seen in my vulnerability is like I feel like I'm feeling proud of myself like and it's like a form of self-acceptance to like put my face on the internet and like talk about these things which I've been terrified to talk about so I feel kind of like I feel like Joy a little bit of Joy about myself yeah I've been wanting to tell you that I'm proud of you this whole time but I was afraid that that would not work out well I'm feeling PR I'm feeling proud of myself and I'm proud of you thank you now I'm uncomfortable but yeah yeah why is that never been told that before and now you're checking right making eye contact making sure what is what is my facial expression saying I saw that little glance yeah you're in danger mode now right yes it feels very scary right now yeah it's tough man should we make a dick joke sure love my dick jokes as do I hey that's something we share um you ready to hear this dick joke sure my dick thanks yeah so I I think it's it's interesting huh so what's it like to have someone be proud of you unfamiliar unfamiliar unknown Danger yeah I see that so I asked you a couple times what you were feeling and actually what I saw in your face was like actually genuine positive emotion it's a flash not that that was different but that there we're getting a little bit better that caught you right and and it can be hard it can be hard and and I I think it's like you were you would say I don't know and I think it's so interesting because what I'm hearing is you're very familiar with your negative feelings but like positive ones are just you know there's touches of Joy like and you've had to work so hard for each each of those uh what I think is honestly really I don't think you are sad but like what makes me sad hearing your story is how hard you've had to work for every slice of something positive in your life that sounds incredibly unfair to me any thoughts about that yeah um it's exhausting um and I guess myself about it oh but to be uh we're lagging for a second let me see if I can enjoy oh there we go it looks looks like we're back um you were saying that you were the last thing that we caught was you were gaslighting yourself yeah gaslighting myself and that like I have like on paper I have a lot going for me in my life so it's like I should feel happy I should feel Joy I should like feel some like positive emotions and and the fact that I don't makes me feel guilty it's like I compare myself I'm like people have it so much worse than me if they're happier and like that's that's part of that and I feel shame I feel guilt for that that compounds the negative emotions and like yeah yeah I think um so I want to just share another thought that I kind of noticed so when you started going to the gym how did you feel about yourself I felt um when I have soft discipline and I demonstrate self-love to myself taking care of myself it makes me feel good about myself because I'm showing myself that I'm worthy of taking care of and but then there's that uh achiever thing that comes in which is like oh [ __ ] like I'm I should be like I've gone to the gym like now like x amount of time and my body fat is still not this and then that's like the shame comes in and I look around and I'll be like [ __ ] like all these other people are like way better than me like and then it comes like okay let's fix this again let's get a personal trainer and then it just gets into this like like be better let's do more and be more valuable whatever and that [ __ ] it up and but like the initial like okay I'm waking up I'm packing my Bears and going to the gym cool but then when there's like outcomes and stuff and I'm like shaming myself or like feeling guilty for not reaching these outcomes these arbitrary things that I said for myself then it doesn't feel good yeah so ish what I'm noticing is that when you're taking action you can feel proud of yourself but when you accomplish something paradoxically it seems to evoke shame I don't think you it's very paradoxical at all but like that's what I'm hearing does that seem right to you yeah it's almost like I can't be proud of the accomplishments almost like don't register I can't be 100 and what do you think that does for your sense of self-worth makes it worse absolutely so the reason I I mean maybe I'm overshooting here a little bit and I think that I'm really happy to hear that if there's complex PTSD involved and some of that other stuff that you're seeing a therapist because I would work on this with them but I just want to point out to you like what I see is that you take the W's in your life and you turn them into owls yeah like that just ain't gonna work man there's no you know and and this is where I can share some information like any thoughts or reactions to that before I keep going yeah resonates and I think here's the real problem like oh do you actually so let me ask you how do you think someone does that how does someone how does that happen to someone's mind and if you want to just think about your own life that's you'll find an answer there but if not I just love to hear your thoughts before I share my perspective um I guess it's just like zero time for generalized but like I guess Asian parents anymore it's just kind of like a minus why is that not an A plus yep do this like why can't I came second in this national competition why don't you come first um yeah all these other kids are better than you um like this cousin or that cousin is doing this and that like you're a piece of [ __ ] like in comparison so it's just like I don't know nothing I ever do is ever going to be good for seeking the validation of the person seeking approval of the person one person that I've wanted my whole life um it's never going to be enough I could be uh I could be like a superhero and a store wouldn't be enough it could be a philanthic person a billionaire blah blah blah it wouldn't be enough let's do something else so that's my that's my guess yeah what are you feeling now I don't yeah I kind of I don't really know again okay so is it does it bother you that I keep asking you that question and do you feel uncomfortable saying I don't know and like oh my God like I should know the answer yeah it's like I should know the answer yeah I don't think I'm not knowing yeah sorry I I just noticed now I'm piecing things together um I don't think you're dumb for not knowing okay can I please explain why sure so you beat yourself up right random Suicidal Thoughts lots of Shame what were you taught about yourself ish when you were growing up what did you learn about who you are alert that I was ugly um my face is defected um I learned that I'm weird because I don't talk much I don't say much I'm not that I was too sensitive um I learned that I shouldn't trust people I learned that money is everything like if I get money then I'm gonna be okay in life and friends are gonna betray you people are going to betray you um uh did Friends betray you or you learned that from your parents that friends can't be trusted I learned that from my caregivers yeah they told you that friends can't be trusted okay so I mean here's the thing right so like is so no one no one has ever expressed being proud of you like for realsies the fact that I have to think so much about it probably says maybe somewhere but I can't really remember I mean so can I tell you what I I yeah go ahead actually I do remember one time is um well I guess the only time in my childhood was when I like when I achieve things is the sounding moment I felt someone was proud of me um and the first time was yeah I won this like a national competition of like web design and I was like in the newspaper the local newspaper and stuff and that was the first moment where I felt like someone was proud of me and I learned that like in order to make people proud of me I need to like achieve things and that's the only way I need to be the best otherwise it's not good enough and who was proud of you my dad I'm gonna just need a second to digest that um yeah so here's what I'm hearing-ish I think so like you kids learn language right and did you grow up in a in a bilingual household yes so do you mind if I ask what language was spoken at home English and Telugu okay um so you know like if you think about it like how do you learn Telugu like it's just what's spoken at home right yes and so but languages are not the only things that we learn we also learn about ourselves like we're going to internalize whatever you know we're going to internalize like whatever we're taught about ourselves so like kids like I'm sure you've seen little kids that are entitled little pos's that think they're the you know the best thing that God ever created and like how do they learn to believe that it's because that's what they're told they're told that you have a different set of rules for you all the other kids get one set of rules but your daddy or Mommy's little special boy and you get a whole different set of rules where you get to break whatever rules you want to and it's gonna be okay because Mommy and Daddy are powerful and we're going to protect you from consequences okay and and I think the reason that it's like like Pride makes you uncomfortable or like other people and this is where it's you know the fact that it was your dad is actually devastating because we don't really know and we're not gonna ask actually on on purpose because I think that goes a little bit I mean you can say if you want to but I'm not trying to pressure you but you know sometimes when you have a child who has a parent who they're trying to live up to and there is one case of pride that [ __ ] the kid because now they have like one opportunity that they have in North Star where they know this works and they go chasing that thing over and over and over again oddly enough what's actually bizarrely healthier in my experience is that if the parent is has zero chances of the abuser has a zero interaction of Pride then the child hopefully will find another human being and then they'll get Pride from somewhere else but if you get it once it's almost like more damaging because then you know it's possible like you felt it before and it feels so good and that feeling is like oh my God it's everything you've ever wanted yes because if you could do that then your self-worth would be good right because like and and so I think what's kind of challenging here so first of all I don't think your dating problems have anything to do with anything except for in a sense you I I do think that and that also I don't think is your fault and I have a couple of thoughts for you about spirituality and stuff but you know my first thought is like you've got to be you've got I don't want to trigger the complex in you that says I need to be better okay so like that we have to be super careful about because that's actually like playing into a bad belief set so I don't know does that make sense yeah so if you need to be better that presumes that you're unacceptable in your current state so there are things that you can do and grow but like don't let that part of you that says oh my God I have to do this to be a decent human being you're a decent human being already you're a good dude I think you have a lot like can I tell you what I see sure and pay attention to yourself okay and if you don't know how this makes you feel ask yourself is that a positive feeling and I just don't recognize it because it's kind of unfamiliar okay okay so first of all I see someone who was born into very hard circumstances may have had some advantages to be sure but was really born in a place where they were like not loved very much and I think that that's sad and I think that's unfair I see someone who despite all of the challenges of their upbringing has through sweat Blood and Tears like risen out of that and has done everything that the world has asked them to do and I think it's incredibly sad that you can do all of the right things and still end up in the place that you are and that's what feels the most unfair to me and what I see is someone who's incredibly resilient I see someone who's incredibly courageous I see someone who despite life taking every opportunity to beat you down refuses to be beaten down I see endurance stamina I don't see hope but there's I don't I don't know what's driving you maybe it's desperation and most of all I see someone who's incredibly tired and who I want nothing more for you than to be able to rest I want nothing more for you than to be able to go on a date and not have to think about all that stuff I want you to be able to go on a date and instead of asking yourself how do I get this person to like me or notice me or love me or get laid I want you to I would love it if you could go on a date and ask yourself is this person right for me is this person deserve to date me do I want to be with this person most of all I I'm I'm proud of you dude I think it's like I'm proud of you and what you've accomplished thanks can you stop saying thanks by the way let's try again wait what do I say instead I don't know you don't say anything okay so I want you to notice what thanks does to you okay so we're gonna try it twice a little experiment so first I'm proud of you thanks what did that do when you say that um let's try without maybe you'll notice the difference I'm proud of you it's like sinking in more of the second second time yeah so I think you kind of like deflect it with the thanks because thanks is like you're closing it off you're like moving on does that make sense okay yeah right because you're you're you're like that's actually like blocking the interaction you're not like and I know it's polite I know you've learned how to do it but what did it feel like hearing me say all that stuff good in what way it's about validating do you deserve you deserve to be valid like validating also it's like is it real though it's starting to become it's starting to feel like I deserve it do you deserve it yes is that the is that your heart speaking or your headset that's my mind yep what does your heart say my heart is still it is there's a whole construction site there with like walls everywhere yeah yeah so do we need to get you to say yes do we need to have you believe that you deserve happiness no you're damn right we don't why not I don't have evidence for that yet okay right answer in my opinion the wrong conclusion I mean sorry the right conclusion but the wrong reasoning so here's why so I I think you're great the Way You Are even if you don't have evidence like I don't think you need to fix that I think the biggest problem is is that you don't need to fix really anything I think you're great the way that you are and I don't I know that's gonna sound foreign to you does it sound foreign you see when I um get into like phases of I guess self-care and like routine so when I'm doing a lot of meditation I love journaling and I'm like you know doing things chasing my passions and things like that like I do feel I get into states where I do feel that and however it's like these phases are like three to six months at a time and then like if I don't do like there's like five things I have to do every morning to feel like that I feel worthy of Love or feel self-compassion and self-love if something slips and then the routine Falls away then I'm back to just self-loathing so it's very fragile but I do feel that and I have felt that but it's like my understanding of it is like I'm just bypassing and I'm not like the phases where I feel amazing it's like I'm just bypassing the actual group of like thing yeah I can I can totally understand that and and that's why like I know it sounds kind of bizarre but like this is so tricky-ish because all of your effort is to get away from that thing yep but it's a part of you and you just carry it with you yes and so you can block it out for three six months at a time and I think honestly like this is where like real healing like has got to take place but in your case I think that healing is going to be hard because I think of for a big part of that healing is actually accepting that you don't need to be any different yeah right you've been chasing you've been trying to fix something like over and over and over again and it's like and this is where like you said okay I fixed everything externally now I need to fix it internally actually you don't need to fix it internally because you ain't broken you're actually fine just the way that you are like you know you suffer a little bit sure or you suffer a lot sure and that may sound kind of bizarre because here you are at randomly having suicidal thoughts house is not broken but that that's just that's just a piece of you hmm and it's kind of like this is a really trick I can see why it's really hard for this to work because or everything you've tried quote unquote hasn't worked because bizarrely like the more that you try to fix it the more that you reinforce the idea that you're broken yes and so bizarrely like it's really weird but you gotta kind of like say like okay like here's the thing okay so if I say you're broken how does that you're broken ish how does that sound validating okay now here's the weird thing I agree you're busted like fundamentally busted okay I'm serious yeah here's the other wild thing I think that's perfectly okay I think you had some trauma growing up and there's a PC that's kind of [ __ ] I don't think it determines the rest of your life I don't think that you need to fix it I think it's just a consequence of your karma and that it's not your fault and it's actually not your responsibility to fix it that what you should fix are the things that you want to fix foreign not what you should fix how does that sit with you um the thing with like um the responsibility is like I do feel like it's part of my karma and I don't have resentment towards the people person that like you know inflicted this pain onto me because I have empathy for the person and like I've worked on letting go of that resentment because I feel like or people who hurt people so I know that but then it's like I feel like what's happened has happened and I've kind of made amends with the past and but like I'm still carrying this like Cannonball of like some scars or whatever I feel like it's my responsibility to fix that to like and and I guess healing is another thing Maybe It's tricky to be like is this another thing to fix and that's what I'm confused about like yeah because I go to there if I go to therapy and then I also do you like spiritual practices and all these things and is that like you're trying to I'm trying to digest these unprocessed emotions through meditation and stuff and is that not fixing another thing yeah so it would be not fixing as well yeah your beautiful question I think you're gonna hate the answer and unfortunately I've got one for you sure does it need to be fixed absolutely do you need to heal ish 100 percent but it's not your responsibility okay so I can hear if I want to but I don't nope you can't heal if you want to other people had to do it for you how it's a good question how does that sound to you it sounds good because something that I've recently been able to do is like ask for help more than I've ever done in my in my whole life and I'm proud of myself for that because it's very hard to do because I've been taught that I can't ask for help and I have to be hyper independent and fix everything myself but I think other people helping me yeah like I mean I'm talking to you and that's that's like I'm allowing you to help me as opposed to reading like 13 books on spirituality and trying to figure out myself so yeah I think I agree with that yeah so I Think It's Tricky right because the the biggest kind of scam that we tell ourselves so like who made you this way ish did you create this for yourself no so the biggest scam that we tell ourselves is when someone else does something to us that we're the ones who can fix it this is I mean it's not a hundred percent true because there's a lot that you can do but when I say there's a lot you can do you've done it all yeah right like you've done your piece bro I don't know what else to do yeah yeah so it and this is what's hard about life and I think this is where like we see the end of what like personal development can do I'm not saying stop doing yoga and like do your five things and all that kind of stuff by all means right but I I think there's there's this this question of like I asked you some time ago like who can you rely on and like that's the problem because I I think that at some point like if someone else has taught you how to hate yourself someone else really has to teach you how to love yourself and that's what's so terrifying is like then it's out of our control and that's also what's so liberating because you're damn right it's out of your control so you can chill the [ __ ] out and you don't have to wake up every day and do your five things and go sign up for this course and go sign up for that of course because when it's in your control when you're the only one who you can rely on like everything is on you and you're looking for a relationship but like you're a monolith like there's no Mutual anything what do you mean by that monolith like I think you're you're like you've got all these walls like you're you're a solo you're like a pillar and there's no there's no I would guess like not a whole I know that you kind of like trauma bonded or maybe like share it a little bit too much and there's like a very practical sense that people may not be ready for that but I I don't know if you uh something about this makes makes me feel like you're not really ready to be interdependent with someone yeah so what I'm hearing is that you can be very emotionally available you can be someone's therapist and there are times where you flip things around where you open up too much and you dump on them but I'm not hearing that you're ready to be interdependent okay but I I think it's going to be tough but I think you should do it actually exactly I'm optimistic for you like I think you can heal like I think work with that therapist I think reaching out to the internet and having the internet answer your call is like because you're deserving of help like you're and you don't have to do it on your own and like start I'm happy to hear you're starting to rely on other people because I think that's when you're going to really feel like because like one day you're gonna think oh I don't deserve it thoughts Reflections questions yeah so the thing with like being not ready for interdependence it's become this thing was like at what point am I ready and not knowing that because it's like as if I look back on my life for the last again maybe even 20 years like all I've ever wanted was like a girlfriend or like some kind of long-term committed healthy relationship and I guess like at what point am I ready for that and how do I determine that I'm ready for that the other part of the question is um like relying on some like being in a relationship wouldn't like allow somebody to support me or like love me in the way that I guess would make me feel like I'm worthy of help yeah I'm sorry I didn't catch that last part being in a relationship wouldn't allow someone to would allow somebody to like take care like yeah no bro you got to find that relationship before you're ready for it you can't let writing this stop you from but then you said I'm not ready for interdependence I'm like yeah yeah right ready uh probably after you've become interdependent or after you've found that person I know it sounds kind of weird but to be honest like I I I think that when you're when you're ready and I don't know what exactly what I mean by that like I think you should continue dating but I I think try to as best as you can like be yourself like work with that therapist heal some of that trauma don't overly emotionally dump but I think like really the main thing is like open yourself up to something without thinking about the outcome right and and really like what I would and I think this is plagued with problematic so this is the least confident thing that I feel like good about but I would say like if you want to go on a date like really just try to I know it sounds kind of generic and I'm sure you've tried this before but really just try to get to know someone and try to see like how does this person make me feel what amount do I want to share how do I feel about them because I I think that there's a certain organicness which is going to be required I don't think you're going to heal a hundred percent and then be ready for a relationship I think oftentimes the most impactful relationships happen when we're not ready and that's where some amount of you know like caution control but also like foolishness like foolishness is an important part of every really successful relationship I don't think you're being stupid enough you know yeah and and I think it's just you're trying so hard dude like just let let them do some of the work sure let other people carry you ish like you've been carrying yourself for long enough dude yeah there's definitely lightness there's a playful side of me which is silly and sarcastic and that's what I want to like engage with because it's fun yeah but it's locked away trying to be why is it locked away again maybe I was just taught to like that's it's not alpha or like just some [ __ ] about some conditioning about what to say what not to say what kind of jokes to make so it's like again like I said there's a database of [ __ ] which is old [ __ ] that I'm just I'm like trying to delete the row by row like every day like good yeah I I I see your situation is actually like a lot more unlearning than learning yeah there's including like the most important stuff to unlearn is all the traumatic [ __ ] and and I think like because you're not I don't see you being you sometimes you're you I think you've learned how to you know mine it from time to time yeah I don't know who I am like to be honest like yeah and I think I've grown up like a social chameleon like I can be whoever you want me to be you can play characters so finding out who I am I don't know it's the Eternal question but I don't know just because you've asked it so far doesn't mean it's eternal well it's been it's been the question are you acting for us today no yeah I think we know you quite well what am I acting today yeah I I believe you I I think I've we've seen measures of it but I I think that you are showing the more positive side of yourself you're taking some of those instinctive reactions and then turning them into what Dr K and the community want to hear which is like yeah I can love myself sometimes like yeah it's like honest yeah yeah there's a bit of performance as well yeah for sure I think but we see that too and I think we see through it too is but sometimes it can feel very hard for people to be seen through or is this hard for you today uh in what way are you thinking that you're misplaying or like oh my God like I should have said this or I should have done this or I looked stupid here or sounded stupid there I don't know the answers like during this during me talking to you not so much but I think like leading up to this and there was a lot of because I've watched a lot of these interviews there's a lot of like things I want to talk about like blah blah blah but it's like it's not being present it's not being spontaneous and that's what a conversation is so yeah you're proud of yourself um I see that that's that's very neither [ __ ] water bottle yeah nervous nervous yeah right yeah interesting yeah so I will I won't torture you much longer because I like and that's like take take the pride take the love and you eat it you eat every last bite-ish we're gonna give it to you and no I mean I I think um one thing I would recommend is like don't overthink this dude like don't watch it again anytime soon like seriously don't watch it like give yourself at least a month like I'm really concerned about what your mind will do you're gonna pick up on all the wrong things you're gonna think oh I I should answer this question differently like honestly I'm not I'm very happy with today you don't have to be about how how do you feel about today I feel good do you have any questions or thoughts or Reflections like and we still have to go I guess just um from a practical perspective moving forward like well should I kind of focus on I guess the main thing is like stop trying let go unlearning things but in terms of like moving forward to uh with my goal in mind which is like you know one day having kids or like being in out the loving committed relationship where would I how do I go from here like and like what does that kind of look like I know that's a big question but no it's it's a very it's a very big question and I have a very what I think is a good but unsatisfying answer you need to stop trying to go from here that's the [ __ ] problem okay now what does that look like that's hard but this is what I mean it's like yeah like you're right-ish like you've been like paying attention because you're like a good you're Indian yes you're good Indian boy and you've been paying attention you know what the right answer is right so you're like how do I like go on from here you try harder to not try so you've spent your whole life trying to make other people happy trying to make yourself happy for the last 10 years you've been growing and changing and moving on from here I think you need to sit down for a little while stop trying so trying is like good for a lot of things it'll make you the money that it makes you it'll get you the body that it gets you it'll get you laid but you've been your strategy has been trying and and I know it sounds kind of weird but like sit with yourself and don't move on like because you don't need to go anywhere and I know it sounds kind of weird but like if you want those things in life I'm not saying that you if you sit around that are gonna happen but like in your case let them come to you like on a weird I don't know like Morning Show yoga pants wearing kind of way like you're you're like trying so hard to find a relationship that you're not letting a relationship find you that's the kind of thing that like 10 of people out there will hear that be like oh my God that's so profound and like 90 what the [ __ ] does that even mean but I mean seriously like this is one of those situations where just like slow down man like give yourself a month or two months like continue going to therapy continue with your routine but try stop trying so hard try to like be with yourself for a little bit and the Very the other practical thing is don't shut people down who are proud of you let people be proud of you let people Express gratitude how do I you know how you said like don't say thank you in that way how do I like absorb that like how do I take compliment or like that kind of thing so this is going to be wild so if that's the right question and you're just you need to do something better okay fine so here's what I would I would ask them can you help me understand that so when they say like ish I think you're an amazing human let's try okay ish I think you're an amazing human being can you help me understand that yeah absolutely so like I think that you've got a lot of advantages and I think you've had a lot of hardships and I think the fact that you're still on this Earth is like I can understand why that person wanted to be your friend and was inspired by you because I think you're the kind of person that inspires people like she thought that oh my God if I get laid this guy's gonna move on but like I need this person to help me transform my own life so that that I can understand a lot because when I when a lot of people look at you they see someone who's been able to transform their life how's that it's good right let's just uh say nothing is this weird like yeah it is it is [ __ ] weird yeah so so you could you could you could like like but I I would I would pick and and choose like who you want to say that with but if you genuinely because I I think the other thing that happens is like it's really your way of shutting down the conversation I think a part of you believes it but a part of you doesn't right when people like say nice things about you yeah that's paranoia yeah so so and that's where like in that moment I I don't know if this is getting kind of very minute but there's a there's a lot of like shutting off of your mind or closing off of your mind when you say thank you right and so what I what I encourage you to do and it probably feels to you like oh my God I'm fishing for compliments right if I like ask people to explain it but like if you can do it with an open mind really try to understand because how the [ __ ] can this person think this about me um and just ask them can you help me understand that it didn't seem to me like what I did was that significant right and you can just own that piece and then like have them say something and then like really try to listen to what they have to say okay does that help or yeah yeah it does now one I don't know mind like okay that's that's usually a good sign do you have other questions or thoughts I mean I've got a million questions about like I I think I just don't need to I've learned that knowing things is overrated so I don't want to know anything I don't want to do anything anymore I think that sounds fantastic so that I mean I I hope you're not pretending to be what we want you to be but I think that's a prime example of exactly what we're talking about you've got a million questions but you're not going to ask a single one because just be right go cuddle your cat and like I don't know what you're gonna do for the rest of the day but like go go do something for you like be exist and live and feel yeah I'm going to like a an acting class something that I've always wanted to do I'm really excited for that and I'm just doing this for myself and yeah beautifully other people there so I hear you they're gonna be other people there nice there's gonna be other people there Adam maybe I'm not I'm I get to perform in like an intentional way I get to maybe I've been acting my whole life and why not do it intentionally yeah go and have a good time yes okay okay listenish thank you very much from our perspective I I really appreciate you posting I don't know I I actually took so this was kind of a funny story but my team reached out to you separately from me right and so I didn't know that they reached out to you but I I saw your post tonight DMD real quick um I don't know if I'm your if you responded back I don't know if I'm gonna see that but I think you know you're deserving of help dude and you're gonna get it like you don't have to do it all yourself like life is multiplayer game my dude and good luck to you and thank you for coming on and being vulnerable and honest and sharing I'm really happy to hear that you found a therapist that you're really working with I think that eases my mind a lot and I think that things are going to get easier for you pretty soon as my honest hope and also belief so take care of my dude cheers adios let me how do I click this up okay chat so thoughts questions Yeah man so I I think that's the thing right so this guy is struggling to connect and and this is like this is the tricky thing so we try so hard to connect with other people and in doing so we fail to connect with them because the harder that you try to connect to someone the harder it actually becomes to connect and so this is like what's so weird right is like ish comes on today and he's like yeah I have a lot of stuff to be proud of and I'm I've learned and we can see right like in his answers I think his answers were pretty honest he's like sometimes he's worked so hard he's like carved out positivity from like Stone like it wasn't like cutting through paper it was like he had to carve out each one of those answers and he comes on here and he's like yeah I'm kind of like you know I mean I I hope he wasn't bsing us too much because he's probably good enough to BS if he wanted to but I didn't get that and and if you really pay attention I think one good thing to watch in this interview is so one thing that we in terms of communication training is micro expressions so if y'all if y'all want to watch again ish if you're watching no watching okay dude you just let it be we're done you couldn't do it better you don't need to learn from it more or you go cuddle your cat but if y'all watch his expressions and and I think sometimes I would kind of put him on the spot and I realized maybe a little bit too late but I think some of what he was feeling and what's really confusing because what confuses him and this is true of a lot of people who have been like traumatized and also are very like functional right so like you all work really hard and you know those negative emotions and you use those negative emotions as like fuel forward but what really confuses people and scares them I mean if you listen to him I'm like are you feeling proud right now and he's like yeah it's terrifying like that he used the word Terror and we like we get so bewildered and when we feel that Terror because we've been taught that we shouldn't be proud of ourselves and when you feel that Terror what it does is it engages all of these like adaptive mechanisms which are generally speaking unhealthy or don't help you so what I'm guessing May really happen with this guy is that he goes on dates and he does have some moments of genuine connection but it just scares the [ __ ] out of him and once it scares him he like goes into some weird like mode and then that shuts off the connection
