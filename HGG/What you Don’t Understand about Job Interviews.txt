a lot of times i'll work with patients who will say like i'm socially anxious i have to give a presentation oh my god i'm socially anxious they're like what if i screw up or i have this big interview what if i screw up am i going to get the job am i not going to get the job are they going to like it are they not going to like it am i screwing up am i not screwing up it's all about me me me me me me then you start to think oh i hate giving speeches i'm bad at giving speeches and once you say i'm bad at giving speeches what have you determined once like simple idea that if you can sort of center in yourself before you give a speech i think it's going to make your speeches 10 times better interviews too yeah so average x 2 says i have an interview in one hour big if i get it any tips absolutely so here's here's a tip so while i was talking so i gave a speech recently right so here's the thing someone asked me um someone from our community asked me afterwards they're like you know did you like get any formal training in like giving a speech like did you like how did you learn how to give speeches it's a really good question the interesting thing is i have very little if no formal training so i had about a two hour workshop in preparation for a talk that i gave when i graduated from residency so that was pretty cool but here's my advice for both interviews like if you want to learn how to give a good speech it's very very simple so a lot of times i'll work with patients who will say like i'm socially anxious i have to give a presentation oh my god i'm socially anxious they're like what if i screw up or i have this big interview what if i screw up so you go into the the speech you try to prepare for it you practice for it you memorize everything you're going to say you just talk in front of a mirror all that kind of stuff so let's think for when you think for a second what's going on in your head when you give a speech what are you worried about like what what is your occupied by your mind okay i have to remember all these things i wrote 300 lines i have to remember what comes next and what comes next what comes next what if i look like an idiot are they are they liking it are they disliking it what if people like what if i stutter what if i do this what if i do this so where is your mind occupied it's not occupied on the speech it's occupied with the way that you are being judged you're worried about judgment right and that is going to lead to a sub-optimal delivery of a speech so there's one really simple tip once like simple idea that if you can sort of center in yourself before you give a speech i think it's going to make your speeches ten times better interviews too and that is to remember that if you're giving a speech right even if it's for a class so you're giving a presentation you can't just randomly give a speech the only time you can give a speech or a presentation is if someone asks you to do it right someone has to like invite you to do it like so at the end of class like even your professor i know it sounds kind of weird but is giving you the opportunity to like give a speech they're giving you an opportunity to give a presentation even for an interview someone is inviting you there to talk to you so they are there to listen to you everyone in the room is not there to judge you that's not actually what they're there for the reason you are being called to give a presentation or give a speech is because they want to hear what you have to say it may be part of a class but still you are being invited so here's the main thing you need to remember this is an opportunity for you to share and enrich the lives of everyone who's like listening to you so if you're giving a presentation i sort of learned this in medical school where i realized even as a medical student so i'm giving a presentation in front of people who have 30 years more experience than i do and at the same time like i'm studying this stuff i can share some piece of information that a room full of doctors can listen to that may actually help them save a life one day even though i'm a student right like there's some tidbit that this person may not know these people are not omniscient and in the same way any time you give a presentation you are there to enrich and explain and share information about something that you know about that other people don't know about you can enrich the lives of other people even your professors so anytime you give a speech remember that you're there for them they're not there for you right like you're the one who's giving something it's not about judgment it's not about grades it's not about any of that stuff you are there to share a piece of what you understand with the rest of the world and enrich their lives by it that's the way you should give a speech so this is 15 minutes where if i'm gonna talk about let's say familial fatal insomnia or hypertensive urgency or how to be positive in video games what what i'm thinking about when i go up there is now i have 15 minutes with a room full of developers and what i say in the next 15 minutes may equip them to build games that have more positive communities if they have games that have more positive communities it'll help people who are feeling suicidal have a better day it'll help people who are bullied in the rest of their life have a like a safe place to go to this is why i'm here i'm here out of service it's not about whether i'm good it's not about whether they like me it's not about whether people clap at the end it has nothing to do with me i am here for 15 minutes to try to enrich the lives of other people and help them do their jobs that's why i'm here and that's what you should base your entire speech on so then the question becomes what can i teach these people in 15 minutes that will help them in build positive communities within video games and in terms of an interview this is the way you should interview you have to understand that this company is looking for someone to do a job for them and ideally they're looking for someone good because the job that they have to do is very legitimate right like they want to do a good job it could be very important hopefully it's important so you are there not to get the job that's not your goal in the interview is to land the job forget about whether it's good for you if it's big for you forget about all that stuff when you go into the interview remember that you could be the savior that this company needs not out of arrogance but that you have something to offer and that this could be exactly what the company needs so that's what you should try to do you should go there and try to offer whatever you have and let them decide don't try to convince them to hire you just genuinely offer whatever it is that you have to offer try to do it out of service right so say hey here's who i am this is what i'm good at this is what i can help you with it's up to you to decide whether you want that help or not it's up to you to decide whether i'm a good fit or not it's not for me to convince you this is just what i'm good at this is what i'm bad at this is my strengths these are my weaknesses here's my experience here's what i'm looking for i'm hoping that this will be a good fit but if it's not a good fit that's actually totally fine right so what you have to do is let go of that idea of you being judged am i going to get the job am i not going to get the job are they going to like it or they're not gonna like it am i screwing up am i not screwing up it's all about me me me me me me me right and if your mind is thinking about you when you're giving a speech you're gonna be empathically disconnected from your audience if you're empathically disconnected from your audience it's going to lower the quality of your speech oh what do they think what do they think like it's not about what they think you're not there to convince them of something you're there to offer or to try to help and once you shift that from your ego and where the way that people are perceiving you to genuinely trying to help and if it's not helpful it's not helpful like even when i gave that speech like on friday or saturday i knew it could have been useless or sorry on thursday right like maybe these people aren't it's not gonna benefit them like i have no idea i don't know what it's like to be a game developer so i'm gonna show up i have no idea if it's good or bad i didn't check with anyone ahead of time maybe i should have retrospect but all it is is like i'm gonna try to do the best that i can given the task that i've been given and try to help and enrich the lives of other people that's what you should focus on it's gonna make it beautiful in terms of like the way that you conceptualize what you're going to say because okay who is this person what do they need to understand what am i trying to teach them what can i accomplish in 15 minutes all of these questions will then like sort of come to the surface and they'll organize your speech for you okay and if you have an interview just do the same thing recognize that like take a look at your resume take a look at your cv look look at the in the mirror and recognize that you are the person who may be able to help this company immensely it's not for them it's not for you to decide whether it's the right job or the wrong job it's for you to go to them and showcase who you are right you want to let them know what you're capable of so you don't want to like upsell yourself or anything like just be authentic be like hey here's who i am this is what i'm good at this is what i can do for you now you tell me whether that's something that you all want or don't want right and so the more that you kind of orient yourselves towards service and this is something where you got to be careful because a lot of companies will like take advantage of that sort of thing so that's like a little bit different but we're talking about foreign interview i genuinely do think so even like as an employer like i do the same thing when i interview someone i'll sort of think a little bit about what can i do for this person right it's not just about a job it's about like someone's growth longitudinally like is this the right place for them to be can i do a lot to help this person is this the right place for them to be and the more that you think about the other person the more you step away from your ego the more you step away from your ego the less you engage your default mode network for those of you that have seen dr k's guide to depression the neuroscience lecture right and the more you step away from the default mode network the less self-critical you're going to be the more natural you're going to feel the better your interview will go the better your speech will go make sense hopefully that helps that's how you interview that's how you give a speech think about them not about you i know it's kind of wild but the interview is not about you right it's kind of weird the speech is not about you that's easier to understand okay sounds an awful lot like detachment you are correct so this is the thing about detachment everyone's like oh be detached question is how how how do we become detached if you want to understand how to become detached look at your mind right what are you thinking about oh my god what are they going to think what are they going to think am i going to say too much am i going to say i'm too much if you start thinking in the middle of a speech am i saying ah too much am i going to say uh i'm too much what do you think you're going to start doing say on um and then you panic oh my god i'm saying um uh and then you're like oh my god i'm doing it again then you start stalling your flow gets disrupted it gets worse then you get into a vicious cycle then you're traumatized then you end up with then you start to think oh i hate giving speeches i'm bad at giving speeches and once you say i'm bad at giving speeches what have you determined you've determined that your identity you've become deterministic now i am something right i'm so bad at it never again you see how deterministic that is it's not i screwed up it's not my mind got away from me i got distracted i couldn't focus on the speech i started thinking about the wrong things that's not what you think you say i'm bad at giving speeches and why is that that's because your default mode network is activated your default mode network your ability to self-reflect a lot of your sense of identity comes out of that and then you lose sight of the other person then you lose sight of empathy when you get caught up with yourself when you lose sight of empathy and you don't understand the other person's perspective your ability to tune into the audience gets shattered because all you're doing is tuning into yourself and then your speech is going to come across poorly right because you're not connected with your audience it's about the audience it's about the interviewer got it make sense yeah so xc11 is saying wow can we use this for social situations yes but there's an important caveat for social situations okay so in social situations you're not actually there to serve right so that's important because if you're not careful if you adopt fully the same idea as a job interview or giving a speech you're going to be tuned into just them which is going to make it a poor experience for you so what i would devote yourself to in a social situation is having a good time yourself and creating a good time for other people but you don't want to make it too lopsided we see this problem a lot where people are like you'll emphasize everyone else in the social situation without looking for your own entertainment because in a social situation it's more even right you're there to have a good time and other people are there to have a good time but i'd still do the same thing in terms of don't get caught up about oh my god am i having a good time oh my god it's not fun here oh my god these people aren't having a good time oh my god like you're just thinking all up here which that may be somewhat true like you know there's elements of that that could be true but you don't want to get caught up in that right so it's just like try to enjoy yourself like what could you do if other people are playing a game you may think to yourself okay i suck at that game i don't want to look like an idiot so then you don't play the game you're standing in the corner on your phone looking at other people with envy and then you start thinking oh my god i'm such a loser they're all hanging out i'm just sitting here on the corner of my phone they're gonna think i'm a loser and then the more they think you you think they think you're a loser what do you end up doing scrolling right and then it just gets worse so like if you feel like an idiot you can say hey i've never played this game before does it matter if i suck and then what are they gonna say they're not gonna say yeah it matters if you suck screw you go go to the corner and start browsing reddit noob no one's ever gonna say that right you're gonna say like no big deal like join us they now they have low expectations for you then you just try to have a good time you're there to have a good time right you're not there to win you're there to have a good time and then like what are people gonna think if you show up and you suck like oh look at that guy like he's confident and all the other three people in the corner who don't know how to play either they're like oh man i wish i could be like that guy that guy sucks and he's playing he's not in the corner on his phone i wish i could be like him right y'all get it just tell people like hey i suck at this can you all teach me cool right because like who's gonna like yeah of course we can teach you absolutely i would love to teach you okay here's how this works and then what's going to happen if they're decent human beings one of them is going to be better at all the rest and that person is going to be on your team and then you'll kind of break even because they're going to carry your shitty ass but then you still get to kind of high five and you can say hey man like thank you so much for carrying my shitty ass if i was a little bit better then you'd turn to your opponents you could say if i was a little bit better i'd be trash talking y'all because we would have absolutely destroyed you i suck at this and this guy is like amazing and we still ended up somewhat even right and then like then i'd be trash talking but it's clear that i can even though we kind of broke even and then you all just laugh right you'll get this it's just i don't know how else this you just you get it so if you guys are curious how to do this okay if you're curious like because like what am i doing right like we're sort of commenting in a meta it's hard to internalize that's what i'm talking about we're gonna this is why we develop i swear to god this is the hardest thing that we're trying to do so we developed group coaching to help you with this stuff the thing is it is so hard to help people understand what group coaching is so if we think a little bit about not getting too caught up in yourself paying attention to what's going on in the room reflecting or commenting about what's going on in the room but not excessively tuning into other people having a shared experience with other people that you benefit from and other ben people benefit from reason we developed group coaching is because we realize that we need a sandbox for people to learn this crap and actually implement it so group coaching has two levels it's not so we're going to formally train you in these techniques about how to interact with another human being how to be empathic we've got a study running right now to see if group coaching boosts eq which is we're pretty sure it does the other thing about group coaching is we're going to use these skills though we're going to teach it to you and then you won't even realize how well you're learning them because then we're gonna turn it to like more standard goals like i don't know what what kind of job to get i don't know i'm struggling to find a relationship i have trouble setting limits with my parents um like i'm confused about what to do with my life like i'm stuck in a dead-end job you take all of these problems and then like you know we're gonna like try to help you with those problems but we're gonna use a skill set which is transferable to other parts of your life and as you boost your eq you're going to be able to tune into other people you're going to be able to tune into yourself and once you tune into yourself then you're going to understand resistance oh i should do this but why don't i do this you don't know you're blind as to why you don't do something because you don't know what's your internal state right so how do you learn that stuff you have to you have to practice this stuff you have to work with these skills other people are going to reflect they're going to notice things about you and group you're going to notice things about other people in group the wildest thing is that you will notice things about yourself in other people and that's when it clicks holy crap this is exactly what happens to me so why did we do group coaching it's because of the aoe effect this is wild right because everyone's like okay personal coaching like sure is great and fantastic and it tends to be full because people get a lot of value out of it so i'm not saying it's bad in any way but the key thing that we discovered that i discovered by showing up on twitch and youtube and doing stuff publicly is that you can actually learn about yourself by observing another person but the observation that what you observe has to be authentic it can't be like an edited blog post it has to be an unfiltered experience of the person and you're going to see the resistance in your callings when you're in group you guys said i remember there was a one i was running a group once or one person was like my goal for the week is i'm gonna cook something we're like okay what are you gonna cook i'm gonna make shakshuka then we check in next week did you make shakshuka no i didn't and then the excuses start coming right and then as you see that your  meter starts going off and then you learn how to detect the bs you point it out to that person hey man you're bs'ing what really got in the way and then when you try to do something and the excuses start popping up in your mind your bs meter is going to go off because now you've developed it and then you'll see the bs and you'll be like hey wait a minute what am i doing to myself how am i shooting myself in the foot right so that's why we do it because there's there's a certain amount of like getting in the ring that group coaching offers that personal coaching sort of doesn't like you're also in the ring i mean it's good because you're working with someone who's you know tuned in to you so that they've been formally trained in all this stuff but if you want to learn this stuff if you want to boost your eq we think personal coaching also boosts eq but group is like it's it's fun like i think consistently there's a handful of coaches and i sort of fall into this category where i personally prefer group work to personal work as a facilitator so i really enjoy working with people individually it's like really fantastic but man it's group fun like it's great you
