so that you can play this stupid game hour after hour after hour after hour and you never get bored and here's the thing that here's where the colored helmet comes in because what are the game developers worried about once you're in the game loop they've got you once you queue up for a game of dota you're stuck in a game of dota if you disconnect you're going to get reported right so they've got you in the game loop so when or when do the developers lose you between game loops so here's the crux of it i often spend hours grinding away at a game for little to no reward but the minute i have to do actual work everything starts to suck so working for 30 minutes feels bad man and grinding in a game for eight hours for slightly cooler helmets so how on earth does this work right why is it that like so we recognize that when we we recognize that when we grind for something in the in in a game it doesn't actually have like real value right like we know that it's like hey this this helmet is different or i get this kind of trophy and this helmet is a virtual item in a virtual world and let's assume for a moment we're not even getting bogged down in like real world economies and auctioning it off for real money or any of that stuff let's just assume that that's not even a part of and yet like when i grind for 30 minutes in real life that actually has a real benefit and so you would think that obviously since one thing means more like in the real world since one thing has real benefit and something has no benefit why is it that like we why is it that i can game for eight hours but i can't grind for 30 minutes in real life so a couple of different things to understand here okay the first is going to be like something about game development so we're going to actually talk about video games for a second and like how they're developed and what developers do second thing we're going to talk about is a little bit about like neuroscience and how that kind of works and then hopefully we'll come to some kind of conclusion about what to do about this so i went to the game developers conference in san francisco a few months ago it was a fantastic conference i really enjoyed being there i talked to a bunch of game developers offered my own thoughts about sort of i was invited to speak about creating positivity and stuff but i sort of figured out like a couple of things that i had never really understood before so i got one interesting question so someone asked me how do we so that just to give you all some context so i was i was there speaking about the psychology of positive gaming so how can you create a community that's like positive in some way and so someone asked me a question um actually let me give you all more context sorry so my general answer was that most of the attempts to create positivity within gaming seem to be tacked on okay and so what do i mean by that that means that if you look at the way that a game is designed they design the game right so they like make the game and they're like by the way we need a positive community so let's like implement some features so they add like a reporting system or they add like a cheering system or they add they like add some system on at the end because someone up there with an mba is like hey everyone's into positivity and gaming right now like developers make some positivity feature like let's make the game positive and that that's when like you as a developer you go to the the person like you know you go to the person who's telling you to build this feature and you're kind of like well like we can build something but the truth is you know we probably need to think about this bigger and like we may need to rewrite some code they're like no no no no no no no rewriting code that's too expensive forget about doing this from the ground up this is the sixth iteration of the game that we're making all the code is already built just tack something on just hack it on we gotta implement some positivity let's do it and so the positivity in the game is like not a core feature of the game right it's like something that gets tacked on so like i think actually dota does a good job of this but let's just use dota as an example so you like play the game of dota and then afterward you can commend someone or report someone but it's not part of what they call the game loop okay and this is really important to understand so someone asked me the question when i was at the conference how do we incorporate positivity into our core game loop and then there i am asking i was like okay that's interesting i have no idea what words you just used can you explain to me what the core game loop is and so this is where like this is the crux of like video game development so especially if you guys look at mobile games you'll understand this very well what is the basic activity that you do from minute to minute or like for a set of minutes within a particular game that's the core game loop and what's essentially done is like that process is optimized okay they optimize that process so that you have the most engagement and you will continue to engage in that loop over and over and over and over and over again here's the key thing the reward in the video game is not part of the core game loop do you all get that this is what's so damn confusing because you're like i don't understand why i'm playing for eight hours for this colored helmet you're not playing for eight hours for the colored helmet the colored helmet is not actually part of the game it just happens at the end the reason for the colored helmet is to get you to cue up into the core game loop again so all all really the helmet does is it causes you to like enter the path and most of your time is spent in the path so this is the way to kind of think about it how much time do you spend queuing up versus playing the game and when you're actually playing the game you're not thinking about the helmet when do you actually think about the helmet you think about the helmet when you finish a game and the game shows you your progress bar you have two out of five stars and once you get all five stars once you get five wins for the day you get the color helmet we have two stars so when does the the when does the helmet enter your psychology it enters when you click play but you're not playing for eight hours for the helmet the only time you're playing for the helmet is when you click the play button and then you enter the core game loop and you lose an hour because that core game loop is designed with so much sophistication that you're going to lose a whole hour hands down right there's going to be the like whatever it is and you'll see this a lot in mobile games where like if you think about the level design for all these like you know different games where you bust stuff right like you're like popping things and popping i don't even know what to call like all these games where you like slide your finger across stuff and you like break crap yeah like fruit ninja or whatever right like whatever like if you think about that like what's the core game loop there like once you enter it's kind of like you board a train and the only time to disembark is it like at the station you're stuck you can you don't stop in the middle and these core game loops are designed with a lot of sophistication so people figure out like what's the right amount of squishiness to add what's the right amount of color what's the right amount of like feedback right when you act within the game you'll see a burst of color you'll hear a satisfying sound you'll even have vibration which i personally find hella annoying in controllers you'll get all this feedback that keeps you ensconced within this game loop and so the reason that you spend eight hours is not for the colored helmet it's because of the sophistication of the game loop and what do i mean by sophisticated over the last 30 years developers have figured out which game loop keeps you the most engaged they figured out what level of color saturation do you need how much sound how much music what kind of music do you need how often do we need to update the terrain so your brain does not get bored of the seeing the same old thing over and over and over again how often do we need to release patches so that people get interested in the game and they'll engage in the core game loop again right so even things like balance patches people want to mix it up right why do they want to mix it up they want to mix it up so that it stays fresh and if it stays fresh you're going to enter the game loop over and over and over again so even if you look at these like you know these mobile games where you're kind of like doing you know one level and then the next level and the next level and the next level they're like 600 levels but every 42 levels there's a new mechanic right there's like something else you have to pop it twice you have to slash it twice it explodes and then they give you different like bomb things that you can pop and this thing that you can pop they make like modifications modifications modifications so that you can play this stupid game hour after hour after hour after hour and you never get bored and here's the thing that here's where the colored helmet comes in because what are the game developers worried about once you're in the game loop they've got you once you queue up for a game of dota you're stuck in a game of dota if you disconnect you're going to get reported right so they've got you in the game loop so when or when do the developers lose you between game loops right so when when i am done with this round and i'm bored of playing the game what i'm gonna do is switch to another game and then someone realized oh my god people will play two rounds of our game and they'll get really really frustrated with it but if we make them play five games and we give them a colored helmet they won't switch between game loops that's where the colored helmet comes in okay now the next thing to think about is like this question remember if we go back to the original question does that make sense people so working for 30 minutes now here's the problem so what i want you all to think about is what is the equivalent of the core game loop for this so if i sit down to study for my algebra test or my pre-calculus test what is a five-minute experience of that like torture pure torture in fact it is the very opposite of the game loop because the second i start studying all i want to do is enter the core game loop that is going to be like makes me lose an hour you all get that so that it's it's sort of like it's not a false equivalency but the fo the focus of what keeps the difference between these experiences sorry i gotta find my words the difference between these experiences has nothing to do with the reward at the end because we've already established that the reward at the end should lead to the opposite behavior i should be studying a lot more and playing a lot less because the helmet doesn't matter whereas in a actually matters so what explains the behavior it's not the reward it's actually the core experience of the activity so studying calculus for five minutes is friggin boring and even though an a is worth more to me on a test then you know some colored helmet in a game that i'm not even gonna play for six months from now like i can't grind in real life and that's because the activity the actual activity the actual gameplay of real life is not rewarding at all there's no squishiness there's no sounds like whenever you get an algebra problem right whenever you solve a calculus problem right there's no there's no reward there's not like a like a you know a flop and a star there's nothing nothing on the dude this my text textbook doesn't even change color like what the hell the page doesn't even turn itself right like i don't even get any stars when i get an algebra problem right like what is this boomer stuff i gotta turn the page myself i have to pick which problem you go to your you go to the back where you've got your like you know 16 problems there's like 16 it's like a pile of random problems that's not how it works in a game in a game they give you one and it's flicking bing bing click it let's go next level and then you see click it and what i'm just supposed to like look at this algebra textbook and just do one freaking boring problem after another boring problem and the second i get it right whether i get it right or i get it wrong there's no differential and reward i don't even know if i got it right or wrong like why am i even doing this freaking algebra problem like i don't even know if it's right or wrong what are you telling me you're telling me that i have to flip to the back of the book and look up the answer and what the hell is this crap only half only the odd number questions have answers half the answers are even missing where's the dlc where do i pay the extra money for that y'all get this so the grind in real life is not optimized to be fun now here's where the here's where the neuroscience comes in and it's short i mean it's complicated we could talk for years about it if you wanted to but here's the thing there are parts of your brain that can't tell the difference okay so we have like the cortical centers of our brain our cerebral cortex is what makes us human it gives us you know the sense of identity and it gives us actually even partially even that not it doesn't even give us that that's part of our primitive brain it gives us high order thinking and higher order functions and all this kind of stuff and then we've got our primitive parts of the brain that are like ooh shiny ooh color like you know that when like you know when you like if you see a piece of jewelry and it looks like vivid and colorful you're like wow like we as human beings universally revere certain kinds of objects like stuff that's shiny we're like friggin magpies so if you have a sparkly something like your eyes are gonna look at it right this is like primitive crap we like particular things we like things that are colorful and a little bit squishy right so if you play games like you know all this like chibi stuff and jelly splash and like there's like a certain you know that we just like right like we think babies are cuddly we think like babies from all species of animals like cute baby deer cute baby kitty cute baby puppy we're attract like it's like a primitive thing and now what the video game does is like it activates all that crap it takes advantage of all that that crap if you look at the font in your algebra textbook it's not like a chibi font it's like you know times new roman which is like we're not into that and so the tricky thing is that you know the higher order functions of our brain that tell us oh yeah an a is worth more to you than a colored helmet that's true but on the deeper order functions of the brain like the stuff that regulates like hunger and thirst and like that kind of stuff like a basic sense of like enjoyment and attraction to color and like you know the parts of our brain that's more like a bot those things can't tell the difference between the two so the higher order value that we apply the abstract value that we applied to a grade versus a colored helmet that may be able to tell the difference but the deeper parts of our brain can't tell the difference so success in a video game activates this is not a real circuit it's just something it's like an emergent phenomenon so you know many years ago i gave this lecture on this thing called the triumph circuit which goes to there's science there but it's basically this idea that we have this human uh you know some psychologists came up with this concept called intent to mastery and what they were looking at they made a really interesting observation which is that kids drop things all the time but they never get fed up of dropping things so if you take a six-month-old that like literally cannot hold stuff right they'll like try to pick it up and they just keep dropping it and an adult will get frustrated after trying something over and over and over again and like not succeeding will give up but kids who can't do stuff like walk like a kid can't walk but they keep trying keep trying they'll fall 50 times 60 times and mind you they're falling a hundred times and they'll keep trying until they get it right what on earth is going on and what they discovered is this is part of our brain or psychology that they call intent to mastery that all human beings have an intrinsic drive to master something that's difficult now what happens this is why kids learn how to walk okay in short what happens with video games is they tap into this primal sense of intent to mastery more so than the abstract goals that we have in real life so our algebra textbook does not tap into intent to mastery the way that video games do and this is what i kind of call the triumph circuit we basically got this this part of our brain that values triumph so what we value in human society is adversity followed by victory the person that we celebrate the most is the one who struggled and then was successful not the person who was handed everything on a silver platter and then they like you know i'm a billionaire today and my path to success was i started a business i inherited two billion dollars from my parents and i started a business and today i'm worth one billion dollars go me that's not what we celebrate right what we celebrate is the person who rises through adversity and so then we look at even games like from software i think is the best example of this or cuphead or whatever and the games that we enjoy playing are the ones that are challenging this is why video game developers have figured this out that like why do we even have matchmaking like why do we pair people up it's because challenge followed by triumph is what we enjoy the most but where's the challenge in triumph in our my algebra textbook compared to something like playing a game of dota so this is what happens this is why like this you know why is this so accurate because game developers have figured out i don't even know that they did research but i think this happens organically it happens like kind of like evolution where someone creates a game and then they add a feature and then that game gets really really big and then a bunch of games add that feature because they're like oh people like this feature so a good example of this is also like if you look at you know games are souls like now right what does that mean that means that when you die you drop your xp there which is a terrible feature i don't know if you guys remember but i remember when i first started playing dark souls i was so infuriated by this feature what do you mean i lose my xp this is bs f this and now half the games you make do it this is what happens they figure out that xp feels so much more to you in your primitive frigging brain that which we can lose and we don't take for granted means more to us and that's like a feature of like human psychology right we value that which we can lose and miyazaki figured that out and now you see a bunch of people doing the same damn thing do you all get that so why does it feel so real because it is because games have game developers are figuring out i don't think this is nefarious i don't think it's necessarily malicious there are people out there who are malicious but i think this is just someone like you know i don't think miyazaki's out there trying to take advantage of our neuropsychology i think he's out there trying to create a truly like intensive and triumphant gaming experience which i think he does that's what they're going by right so most game developers what they at least the ones i've worked with will will try to make the game that they themselves wanted to play they're like i would love to play a game that dot dot dot but if you even think about it where does that love for a video game come from it comes from i've played this game that scratches these five neuroscientific itches but is missing this itch in this itch so i'm gonna make a game that includes these five things and tax on this and tax on a community element and tech tax on some kind of progression and tax on this and so over time this is what's happening games are getting more and more engaging three years ago just to summarize three years ago i went to the american psychiatric association i said hey i think video game addiction is a huge problem i think we should take this stuff more seriously the response that i got was nice they said it sounds like you're really on to something but we don't have the bandwidth because we have an opiate crisis here in this country and that's where all of our energy is that year i submitted an abstract to present at the national conference and the abstract was declined because they had more important things to worry about so this year we presented something at the apa conference but more interesting there were four sessions that i could see that were related to video game addiction this year so this problem is getting worse about 10 or 12 years ago about six percent of people were worldwide were addicted to video games six percent of people 10 years ago now the number is closer to 11 percent so this is getting worse and like that's because the games are getting better right and the better the games get the more true this becomes so be careful so coffin rock 15 is saying bs games are crap now yes they are you are correct so this funny thing is that i actually agree with that and more people are playing them and why is that why are games getting worse and more people playing them total amount of time played is increasing why is that it's because people are figuring out how to scratch your itch your neuroscientific itch and it's not about creating a brilliant game anymore it's not about creating a game that is based on making it as fun as possible it's about creating games that are geared towards engagement towards play time right so you're right that games are in some ways getting worse and they're getting more addictive and half bunny's saying it's exhausting you're damn right but boy do you gotta keep playing sleeping with this 108 is saying seven thousand hours of dota still need more yep frustrating but rewarding just like life is supposed to be 789 frustrating but rewarding right because that's what our brain loves you
