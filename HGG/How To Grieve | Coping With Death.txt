okay so let's talk a little bit about grief what does it mean to grieve and how do i do it in the past two months i lost my oldest brother and my mom their deaths were totally unexpected and my family is pretty shaken up this is my first time having to deal with loss within my direct family and i genuinely have no idea how to grieve so far i've just been trying to go with the flow of my moods and thoughts i.e cry or reminisce when i feel like it requests space from friends or family when i when i want to be alone indulge in distracting enjoyable activities like watching tick tock or reading fan fiction i also journal journal slash record videos and audio notes of my thoughts as a way to process but i don't know if i'm making any real progress on that front as i'm just thinking out loud aside from this kind of passive moment by moment approach i don't know what to do to make sense of their deaths or heal the rest of my family seems to be understanding this through the lens of our religion islam by reasoning that it was just their time to go back to allah and we'll be reunited with them in the next life because i'm not super religious myself this kind of framing doesn't really comfort me or help me to process their loss in a meaningful way a large part of me doesn't think that i will ever see them again and i'm having a hard time coming to terms with such an unfathomable idea especially because i can't really voice that thought to my friends as they become distressed and uncomfortable anytime i mention doubts about religion or suggest a different way of seeing things i do have friends that i can talk to about these thoughts but i worry that i will emotionally dump on them or burden them with my fears so how do people grieve what does it mean to grieve how does one grieve if they don't have a general philosophy about life or a way to understand the world i think the fact that i don't have a central religious philosophical scientific framework for understanding life makes it difficult for me to know how to go about this because death just seems random and unfair to me any advice suggestions or personal experiences that you'd want to share are greatly appreciated and i hope you're all safe and well thanks for reading so this is a fantastic post because it asks a really important question what does it actually mean to grieve right how do we do it like how do we accept death how do we move on how do we learn to live like what is when people like go through this grieving process like what does that mean like how do you know when you're done how do you know if you're doing it right how do you know if you're doing it wrong furthermore i think as people have started to become a little bit more religiously flexible let's say so as a society you know there's a trend towards agnosticism or atheism which i think is totally fine but i think the the bigger trend is not necessarily towards those things but towards a general sharing and greater understanding of different religious perspectives which i think is hugely positive right so in the past like let's say a thousand years ago your religious exposure was like very limited and nowadays like people can learn about all kinds of stuff right like if i want to go out and buy the quran and read it i can i can read commentaries about the quran i can watch youtube videos about the quran i can read stuff about the gita i can read things about the gita from this person that person um i can go to a buddhist meditation center and like walk in and like learn how to meditate i can walk into a church so generally speaking what we're doing is we're seeing a ton of exposure to different kinds of religious or even non-religious thought right so even kind of in the non-religious realm like there there's stoic philosophy there are people who are atheists who will sort of talk about morality and like you know how to make sense of death and like all this good stuff so we have a lot of these different perspectives so how do you know like how to grieve right you know what what do you mean how do you make sense of it because in the past what used to happen with grief is that like we would have a large you know religious perspective which would make sense of the world for us and much like this person's family you know people would just use religion is kind of like the playbook for how to manage death but as we get exposed to all these different fla like concepts like we don't really know okay which one is like the most correct we don't know so as we become sort of religiously more flexible people oftentimes people like this person right who sort of grew up in a religious tradition but doesn't necessarily believe it they're left kind of like spinning in the wind because everyone else has this playbook but like i don't have a playbook so how do i do this thing right and so we're left asking these questions like how do people grieve what does it mean to grieve how do i know if i'm grieving so i'd like to talk to you all today about grief okay oh there we go so let's talk about a couple of things so the first thing that we're going to do is talk about oh it's green oh my goodness okay let's go back to white so we're gonna talk about grief today so the first thing that we're going to do is we're going to you know talk a little bit about you know what is grief we're going to talk a little bit about why is grief hard and this is going to get kind of interesting but when we ask the question how do i grieve what we're going to do is actually talk a little bit about how death affects people right so if we want to get if we want to get past something what we need to understand like if we want to fix something then what we need to understand is what the damage in the first place is right so like if i have a flat tire then i know how to fix my car because i understand what damage has been done to my car so what we're going to start with is actually like how does debt death affect people and once we understand how it affects people then we can sort of move on to you know how do i set things right and then once we understand how to set things right then we'll sort of understand what the grieving process is okay and um and this is this also we're going to talk a little bit about you know science and medicine and epidemiology we're going to talk just a little bit about death today um and then you know if you guys want to we can touch on certain like eastern perspectives that are a little bit more spiritual or uh religious in nature that's kind of optional i'm not sure that i want to do this along with the rest of the grief stuff because i think it's important that i feel pretty confident that this part is going to apply to everyone whereas depending on your perspective or your belief system like this part may not apply to you and i just haven't decided like internally whether i want these things to be together right because then i i don't want to come across as being quite objective here and feeling very confident in what i say like scientifically and then sort of adding some eastern stuff at the end and i just want to make sure that we separate those two things out because i don't want anyone to think that this is just the scientific is like the stuff okay because it really isn't so the first thing is so we're gonna define a couple of things okay so number one so what is grief so the term bereavement and we're gonna start with some vocabulary means losing a loved one okay so this is kind of interesting statistic so on average when one person dies there are nine people who are bereaved on average so what this means is that if you look at the average human population if one person dies there are going to be nine people who are going to be severely affected by that person's loss so this includes like close family members friends like best friends you know so on average every person that passes away leaves like nine people kind of messed up next thing to note about bereavement is that it's not always dealt with um kind of in the same way so there seem to be cultural dependencies with how we deal with bereavement so i'll give you guys just an example so there was one study that has a super low sample size um about like less than 30 individuals that looked at parents in the united states and china and these are parents who had lost children and so what they sort of they tracked these people over time and what they found is that at four months um both parents were about the same in terms of like their impairment and like how sad they were and things like that how much the loss of their child was affecting them but the interesting thing is that at 18 months um on average the chinese parents were actually like more adjusted or had learned how to cope or were kind of back to normal in a way in in a greater way than the parents from the united states so like i said this is a relatively small study you know just looking at how different people process grief it doesn't we don't want to infer too much about cultural the purpose of citing this study is not to assume that chinese people are better at dealing with grief than american people are it's really to just point out that there is evidence that there are cultural dependencies and so if you're watching this understand that what i'm going to be sharing with you may be like adjustable by your culture okay that's really the main point of citing that study and if we kind of look at like what you know what happens when people pass away what's the you know what is the experience of belief bereavement so people get all kinds of different symptoms so for example they'll get they'll have difficulty concentrating right you it's like hard to focus on your schoolwork and stuff like that you tend to be preoccupied with the person who's passed away so you're thinking about them all the time you're like having difficulty sleeping and stuff like that that's another one by the way sleep disturbance okay so you're thinking about them it's a difficulty sleeping is this person kind of said you know we'll cry and things like that you'll get more emotional so there's tends to be a little bit more emotional disturbance or dysregulation so people feel sad more right we oftentimes feel lonely after we lose a loved one and this is it kind of important sometimes we experience mild hallucinations which are completely normal okay so it is not unusual to sometimes even see your loved one or hear them calling your name so remember so a lot of people assume that hallucinations equals mental illness or equals psychosis or schizophrenia right people just assume that if you're hallucinating you're mentally ill but it turns out that none of these are actually true so a hallucination is a symptom right it's like fever there are all kinds of causes for fever it's like chest pain there are all kinds of causes for chest pain or even pressure in your chest so chest pressure what's the differential diagnosis of chest pressure could be myocardial infarction which is a heart attack or could be falling in love right so remember that we as human beings we experience all kinds of things and generally speaking one of the things that a lot of people tend to do is they'll assume that a symptom equals a diagnosis right i feel pressure in my chest well like what is that is are you bereaved are you having a heart attack are you falling in love like what does that mean similarly hallucinations there are a couple of cases of you know hallucinations being a normal human process and bereavement is actually like one of them so bereavement sort of is losing a loved one and these are some of the symptoms that we experience it's culturally dependent right so these these may change depending on what part of the world you live in or what your religious tradition is and then we get to grief so grief is the natural response to bereavement right so grief is like the way that human beings adapt to and respond to losing a loved one so it also it's also important to note that you know grief is not necessarily or definitely a response to bereavement but it can also be like a response to a breakup even losing a job right we can be grieved about all kinds of things you know getting expelled from school like it's not necessarily the death of a of a loved one and so grief actually has um a number of different kind of manifestations so this is like this is bereavement right and then as people start to grieve as they start to respond to the loss of the person you know it's characterized by similar things to bereavement look like there are a couple of things that are a little bit different so one is that exploration is inhibited and we'll get to that in a second right so there's like a reduced interest in life um there's this is a really actually common one that people are surprised by there's an unfamiliar incompetence in daily life so this is a key one to zero in on when someone you love passes away it's it's kind of funny because it's like bizarre but you just start to feel like you're bad at stuff that you're normally not bad at so and this is the thing is that people will oftentimes beat themselves up right because like they lost a loved one sure like maybe your best friend passed away but your best friend passing away doesn't mean that like you're incompetent at microwaving food or like reviewing resumes so oftentimes as a result of some of these things like difficulty concentration preoccupation with loss right what that'll end up doing is like make you not as competent as you used to be and so this is a really common one that i oftentimes see a lot of like shame and like guilt and confusion for this one but the truth is it's kind of a normal part of the process right so like you just kind of feel like incompetent we'll get to a little bit about why that is as well so and then the last thing is that often times when someone passes away there's confusion about long-term goals um if you all are very interested in like learning more about this stuff i think there's a lot of stuff with attachment theory that we'll touch on today i'm not an expert in attachment theory but i think that there's a lot of good stuff from the realm of attachment theory about grief but this is essentially what we can expect from you know the grief response and over time what we're going to try to do is like since these are the ways that we get affected we're going to try to like fix each of these things okay so these will end up with sort of like um let me just think a little bit about you know what are the different things we'll talk a little bit about how as we resolve these things we'll sort of go through what healthy grieving looks like but before we get to healthy grieving let's talk a little bit about unhealthy grieving so this is really key okay so the grief process the normal grief process i'd give people four to six months so a lot of people like i guess we don't get taught this stuff right but like how what's a normal amount of time to grieve so like how long should you have this grieving debuff and i'd say that on average it should be like four to six months with some stuff lasting up to a year but generally speaking if if you're still having some kind of struggle like really a struggle uh you know after one year of a particular loss chances are you've moved into the psychiatric diagnosis of prolonged grief and prolonged grief is characterized by you know sustained grief longer than normal and also impairment to function so if your grief is really like i mean it's okay for it to be like making things a little bit trickier but you should still be able to at the four-month mark be able to you know participate in school maybe it's not quite as easy to concentrate but you should be able to do your assignments you should be able to take tests you should be able to go you know continue to work at your job if you want to you should be able to exercise cook for yourself clean for yourself whatever your standard is you know maybe you should still be dating or you know be able to enjoy going to the movies or things like that you may miss that person when you're at the movie because you have memories of you know how you all used to watch movies together but generally speaking we're talking about you know the normal grief process like these kinds of symptoms should last about four to six months and then you know some of this stuff should start to get better over the course of like one year and if if it's taking you longer than that then you should seriously consider seeing a mental health specialist and sort of think a little bit about prolonged grief for kind of what's holding you back so the other thing is that it's not just prolonged grief so there's evidence that shows that grieving can be a risk factor for precipitating other diagnoses so for example 20 to 30 percent of people who have who grieve and have lost a loved one will end up with mdd or a depressive episode now what this sort of means so it doesn't mean that 20 of people i have to clarify that number it doesn't mean that everyone who passes everyone who loses a loved one has a 20 chance of getting depression that's not what that means what this means is that for people who have major depressive disorder about one out of five of them if they lose a loved one that can be a risk factor that will trigger their existing illness right so remember that major depressive disorder or clinical depression is a case where someone has some kind of like genetic or like um you know upbringing related predisposition for depression there may be like some kind of vulnerability to ano to a neurochemical imbalance so what we tend to see in people who have a depression is that grief can trigger that imbalance and then they get into the depressive episode they get treatment they get better and everything can still work out it's not that big of a deal but you know it can absolutely trigger an actual depressive episode the other thing that sometimes happens is that remember that major depressive disorder is a vulnerability right so there's some amount of like genetic stuff going on and then in the right circumstances that predisposition for depression will actually manifest as depression so in some cases what we'll see is that major depressive disorder their first episode is triggered by grieving right so that's like a major stress on the mind a major stress on the body as a result like it can trigger your depression so we also see that about 22 to 27 percent will get some kind of anxiety right so once again about a fifth um so generally speaking loss of a loved one does not cause ptsd unless it's like particularly violent or something like that or like particularly traumatic loss but it does appear that losing a loved one increases the risk of ptsd if something else happens down the road and it about doubles the risk so there's something about you know the state of grief that forms some kind of stressor on the mind that allows you to be more vulnerable to other things so if you have ptsd and you lose a loved one sometimes your ptsd can get worse if you lost your loved one in a particularly traumatic or profound way it can cause ptsd but we do tend to see things like depression and anxiety kind of get worse or sort of get triggered somewhat by the grieving okay and so these two weren't mental health evaluation and treatment so like this is where you know if you guys have if you've lost a loved one and you're kind of like difficulty concentrating for a few months you know you're feeling kind of lonely like you're having trouble making sense of the world and your life and stuff like that that's all completely normal but if it's getting to the point where you know six months have gone by eight months have gone by you're having trouble getting out of bed you can't go to work anymore you're having like nightmares or flashbacks or things like that or your grief lasts longer than a year then you should seriously consider getting mental health treatment okay now talked a little bit about unhealthy grief so now we're going to do is talk about the process of morning so morning is like going through grief okay so it's kind of like the process of adapting to and integrating grief right so once we have a loss like we as human beings need to like adapt to it adjust to it integrate it into our lives and generally speaking there are a couple of important like components of mourning so one is accepting the loss right which like you may know they're dead but like on some level your mind may not have fully integrated and we'll get to this in a second may not have fully integrated like what their loss means for you right so as you go through your first birthday without them as you go through your first holiday without them as their birthday comes up as your graduation comes up like as is milestone events start to come up without this person like their loss becomes like more and more known to you right you sort of like it sinks in and then over time you'll gradually accept it a second thing is accepting the consequences of loss so this may sound like a little bit redundant but as i was kind of saying like you know as you go through birthdays and stuff like that there may be like consequences of like losing your parent right so one is that your parent may never be around anymore but then like let's say i'm a young woman and i want my dad to walk me down the aisle like accepting the consequences of dad no longer being around can be a little bit different from him not being around right so one is that your dad is never going to be around again which can absolutely be painful but then there's like all of the stuff that comes with that absence in your life okay and this is kind of a little bit tricky because if we look at people right what do people do for us so this is where we're going to touch on attachment theory for a second so what do people provide so what do we get from people right what we get is they provide a safe haven like important people in our lives right some somewhat of a home base they allow us to like learn new things um they allow us to take chances and then they offer some degree of constancy in our life right so like when i say they allow us to learn new things i mean obviously we can learn new things without other people but let's say i'm picking up something as simple as a video game right so like if you think about when you start playing a new video game who else starts playing a new video game and so your friends you and your friends decide to all get a game together right and we're like oh we're going to play apex legends or whatever we're going to try dota we're going to try law whatever and so if you really think about it like having close friends allows you to learn new things in sort of like a safe environment where all you all are going to experiment together let's say you and your friends are going to go you know y'all are going to go to the beach and you're going to learn how to surf together the other thing that people allow you to do is to take chances close people right because they're going to be there for you they're going to be some degree of like support so let's say i want to ask someone out that i'm attracted to and i go to my you know my friends and i say hey i'm going to ask this girl out like and they're like okay bro like you got this like good luck like you know we you know we're we're here when she rejects you lol right so like they like people provide us some degree of security they allow us to take chances very true for parents right so like your parents are oftentimes your safety net your parents are the ones that encourage you to try new things and then people also in like give us some degree of constancy so this too is we'll talk about parents and people on discord right so your parents will oftentimes you'll go home for christmas or you'll go home for thanksgiving or you're go you'll go home for a particular holiday and so if you practice a particular religion and you go home during the time of your religion like you're celebrating hanukkah or diwali or whatever there's a certain amount of constancy and tradition and like your life sort of like has this stability which they provide so even if you know things are uncertain in other parts of your life you have this one source of constancy that people provide the other thing that's really really important about what people provide is our sense of identity this may sound kind of confusing because you know are wouldn't you assume that identity comes from within well no actually like your identity a big part of your identity actually does not come from within the lion's share of your identity actually depending on how much into yoga are you can even say all of your identity comes from everywhere except for within and that may be kind of confusing for a little bit but if you think about who you are and how you identify yourself those ten like all of those attributes don't actually come from you they come from the external world so if i identify as like a gifted kid for example right where did i get that identity i got it because my parents were like oh you're so precocious you're so smart right like our neuropsychologist tests you and says you have an iq of 185 right so that identity that sense of identity actually comes from another person so we get described as funny we get described as you know grumpy we get described as awesome at dota we get descri described as you know a one-trick pony in apex legends or overwatch like we get described as all of these things that we sort of internalize our ide as our identity i'm a smart person i'm an ugly person i'm a good person i'm a bad person if you think about a child who grows up in an abusive household right how do what do they think about themselves they think they have very low self-esteem they value themselves lowly right so all of these issues of identity right when when you're kind of viewed as a good person and everything is going to be okay and you'll bounce back your resilient kid i have faith in you all of that all of those aspects of identity come from another person actually don't come from us and so when we lose someone who provides this sense of identity our identity becomes uncertain right so if you just think a little bit like i you know i'm going to mention a couple things that are kind of sad but like well let's just take the kid the case of a kid right so a kid let's say a seven-year-old kid who loses a parent the parent is going to be a major source of you know like comfort and reassurance and telling the kid like you're a good kid right you're loved and so if you think a little bit about that if you remove that parent from the equation what is that how is that identity gonna change for the kid over time like there isn't that person telling them constantly that you're okay and i accept you unconditionally right so that's gonna be like a very very big shock to their sense of identity so when we lose someone who is close to us our sense of who we are changes so the next thing that happens is that we have to change our relationship to the lost object so like i have a particular relationship with my dad let's say but if my dad is no longer around like i still have some kind of relationship with him i know it sounds kind of weird but like i relate to him right so like i will something about my life will continue to be affected by him the things that he taught the memories we have the pictures we have like all those kinds of things are still going to be like part of my life right he's not like truly gone because he continues to exist in my mind i i listen to his favorite music i hear his you know i see people wearing his favorite brand of clothing i go eat food that reminds me of our dad so then we have to change our kind of relationship to that person even though they're gone because they're gone now right so we can't have the same relationship we used to have and over time as we mourn we restore the capacity to thrive right so like generally speaking and we'll get to this in a little bit as well maybe we should have started here but you know as we start to become uncertain about our future and things like that like we start to worry a little bit about like what's gonna happen what am i gonna do because we start to uh you know become have difficulty concentrating as we start to have reduced interest in life as our exploration starts to be inhibited you know like these are the consequences of grief so part of mourning and the healthy process of grieving is to start to like restore the capacity to thrive in life right where life becomes like hopeful and this is kind of the last thing which is that you know looking to the future with happiness and optimism and this kind of presumes that you know you were looking to the future with happiness and optimism before the person passed away but basically kind of like being back to square one with this like integrated sense of loss and this is the the process of mourning so when we talk about successful grieving and how do i grieve it's basically to like go through these stages right so the first is you get affected by the grief in this way uh the bereavement causes these basic things right so like hallucinations and then if we think about the bereavement is over here and you are over here there are going to be changes to your person right so you will start to change and that process is grief as you integrate those changes and adapt there's a smiley face it's a bad smiley face but then you as you go through the process of mourning what we want you to do is kind of like adapt to those changes start to reconceptualize life still a bad smile face um and then sort of like learn to accept the loss learn to accept the consequences of the loss you know change your sense of identity like reintegrate yourself um change your relationship with the person who's lost and then hopefully start to be like optimistic about the future and like you know be able to enjoy yourself so let's talk a little bit about in general like what happens and and so this is kind of like a you know stepwise fashion but now i'm going to try to summarize everything okay so here's you and generally speaking when we try to make sense of the world our sense of the world is about constancy okay and so if we like if there's a kid who's like learning about gravity for example like gravity is actually really reassuring because it always works the same way so you can count on it right as human beings like we operate most of our life like counting on things to happen so i know that there's a lot of uncertainty in the world in covid but we still like wake up every day and like i count on my toilet working i count on the sun rising i count on my car starting i count on you know my family members being at home but like my life is organized and makes sense because of the constancy of it and a huge part of that constancy is other people right so if i think about like my life like my life is what it is because my wife does particular things my kids do particular things y'all do particular things so i rely even on you know the internet to show up when i'm doing these kinds of things to watch these kinds of videos and so everything in the world makes sense and if there is constancy and if there are rules to the game then i can plan a strategy right if i know like how to play the game of life like or if i can if i know the rules of the game of life then i can plan an appropriate strategy for example like there's we have phrases like business casual right what does business casual mean it's like a rule it's like a way to sort of describe what i'm supposed to wear so like people tell me oh it's business casual so then i know how to like plan a strategy for this kind of event like what kind of people can i expect or is it like you know do i need to wear a tuxedo like you know what's the what's the attitude what's the atmosphere what's the tone so we use all of these terms like business casual or like you know other kinds of man-made constructs to plan a strategy for life now the tricky thing is that when we lose someone right so when someone passes away this constancy gets shaken up so if we think about like you know i'm planning my future and i'm thinking about all the different things that could happen but they all involve this person's influence in some way so let's say like a parent right so for example like if i have trouble at work i can go to my parent and ask for advice if i have trouble in a relationship i can go to my parent and ask for advice if i run into financial hardship i can move back in with my parents and they can like provide me with a place to stay so a lot of the rules of the game that i'm playing are going to be dependent on particular people like existing and so what starts to happen and what makes grief so difficult is as like this person leaves then this becomes a question mark this becomes a question mark and this becomes a question mark so then from constancy we're actually moving to uncertainty because this is what happens in our brain is like we wake up every day and your loved ones are there right like it's such a given but once you take one of your loved ones out of the picture suddenly your brain is like i don't know what else i can count on what can i trust in this world right like and so this leads to anxiety and this uncertainty and anxiety about the future then makes it difficult to do things like explore new things and like have an interest in life and plan for the future because your part this part of your brain is like i've counted on this person being there all the time right like i've relied on them i've assumed that they were going to be there and now i have to redo all of my calculations what kind of job do i want if my parents aren't around what kind of relationship do i want if my parents aren't around what am i what am i going to do about money if i don't have the safety net of my parents so there's so many things about our life that we sort of assume are going to proceed a particular way because our brain just calculates just like gravity like mom is around dad is around right or even your pet is around and so you just like count on those kinds of things but if your pet is no longer there then suddenly like all of your vacation options change right what time you need to wake up in the morning changes what you need to buy at the grocery store changes so there's so many things about your life that suddenly become uncertain and as we become uncertain this leads to kind of anxiety and then like this anxiety then leads to a lack of exploration lack of optimism right because what if someone else passes away and so that that's going to be kind of terrifying for the mind to deal with who are you now without this person and so as all of these things start to change it can become very very difficult and this is kind of the process of grieving that we talked about and then we also have to start to like reintegrate ourselves after we lose someone so we have to start to think a little bit okay like now that my parents are gone like who am i right you have to at you have to reintegrate your identity you have to figure out who you are you know how often are you gonna visit their graves like what are you gonna you know are you gonna still talk to them like are you gonna pray to them like do you believe they're in heaven like what's going on so there's just a lot of uncertainty that that kind of gets thrown up in the air and so this person for example is talking a little bit about you know not being as religious as many other people and so the cool thing about religion is that religion basically like takes this and turns it back into constancy right so this is the effect of religion because your religion will say they're waiting for you in heaven okay so the rules of the game actually haven't changed right because the religion provides you with rules of the game so if you're an agnostic or an atheist or even if you're of a religious background and haven't really gone through this stuff then you're going to be left with uncertainty and anxiety and then you may turn to a particular religion and you'll find answers and so like what do those answers mean those answers are gonna be like people who find answers in religion or religion is gonna help them do these things right so they'll help you like recognize who you are okay they're gonna be in heaven i'll see them one day so now you've changed your relationship to the object of your loss right they're praying for me like my dad is looking out for me from heaven okay so now that my dad is looking out for me i can start to look to the future again and i know that he would be happy and i can like have positive emotions and stuff like that right and so sometimes religious organizations will also provide like a safe haven right so you go to the church you go to the temple whatever and there's like people there that will comfort you and things like that and so this is basically the process of how to grieve right and people will say oh well i guess i mean we haven't talked too much about the how these are sort of the goals and so like how does this manifest so i'd say that sometimes um you know there are there are going to be things like what this person said so there's going to be like moment to moment emotional experiences there's also going to be milestones which need to be kind of like just rethought or re-experienced so what do i mean by that this is things like birthdays holidays religious ceremonies marriages graduations all of these things have changed right so the process of grieving involves like experiencing those things feeling that moment to moment emotional experience thinking about what does this mean for my future and hopefully over time like finding like other things to fill in the vacuum of the lost person right learning to love again um and then so there's gonna be like some amount of identity formation so who you are may change in your mind and so you're going to be kind of confused about who you are because this constant source of kind of identity determinism from the loved one is now gone so your your identities would be gonna be kind of like confused and and not certain what it is and so you're gonna like go through some amount of introspection and going for long walks and listening to sad music and watching movies and maybe going to church and having funeral ceremonies and all these kinds of things which will like sort of help you form your identity and then over time you'll have to learn how to be optimistic and what does this look like so you're going to have a tendency to not want to do things right you have a reduced interest in life and gradually over time there's going to be some weird neurochemical physiologic stuff going on so for example there are studies that show that the immunity that you gain from a vaccine varies depending on whether you're grieving or not so there are even psychoneuroimmunologic changes that will affect like the robustness of your immune system and make you more vulnerable to like illness so it's not just psychological that's absolutely neuroscientific you know physiologic hormonal there are all kinds of different changes going on as those changes start to balance and as you start to like engage in new experiences right you try something and you're like oh this actually is fun so a good example of this is if you've lost uh you know a partner or spouse right and then like you're like okay i'm gonna be alone forever which sort of makes sense and then you meet someone and you get a little bit attracted to them and then like you go on a date and you enjoy yourself and then you feel guilty for your enjoying yourself and then you're like dealing with all these things then you have an identity impact right because you're like oh my god i'm betraying my wife now i feel like i'm uh i'm uh you know i'm being unfaithful to her so i don't want to be an unfaithful person so there are all these assaults on your identity you feel pessimistic there's a moment to moment you know emotional experience the milestone as you went on a a date and there's another milestone which is like maybe you become sexually active with a new person and then you feel even worse about yourself and then you have to like work through that stuff right like you experience these things you reintegrate and then you sort of realize okay like actually you know they would want nothing but for me to be happy and they're probably okay with this and i hope they're okay with this whatever i'll talk to them when i get to heaven maybe they'll be pissed we'll find out and then you start to engage in new experiences and as you start to engage in new experiences and you go on on dates and you start to like you're like oh actually this is actually a lot of fun maybe and then you start to think about the future with the second person because then you learn how to be optimistic and you're looking forward to holidays and then you're kind of like back to normal right and then you've gone through the process of grieving questions yeah so maybe some of my random examples which are used to support the point may be hitting a bit close to home so i think this is absolutely the kind of thing that you know for example like an interview would do really good at like illustrating this stuff right it'd be nice if we could like pair like a solid interview with this of someone's experience of okay i've lost a partner and now i feel like really bad about myself so then like you we would see all of these features at play as we go through the interview right yeah so identity is always changing absolutely uh so the kubler loss raw stages of grief i think are pretty accurate like they're pretty good um i how can i say this just as a psychiatrist like clinically i find this to be like more useful than the kubler raw stages of grief just because like it it it helps or it is i mean i i assume it's helped my patients but when i sort of help them understand that like okay so your mind so here's like a summary okay so your mind like as you operate through the world like as you navigate the world and you go to work and you go grocery shopping and stuff like that it has these core assumptions like gravity the sun rises in the morning and sets in the evening this person exists in my life and so what makes grief really hard is that like a fundamental about your universe has been changed it's suddenly like gravity has stopped working the sun is no longer going to rise this person is gone and it takes time for your mind or your being to adjust to that loss because suddenly like now everything has changed the groceries that i buy have changed because there's one less person living at home i used to hate these cookies but they used to love those cookies and i'm not buying those cookies anymore my future starts to change because this person was a huge part of my future we were going to get married we're going to do this we're going to do that so now like all these plans that i had like will disappear even my identity changes because so much of who i felt like i was on a day-to-day basis is based on how this person treated me right how they responded to me like the fact that i feel like a good person because my partner is ill and i take care of them and like now they're gone and then like i don't know who i am anymore so so many fundamentals about who we are how we live our life how we plan how we look towards the future suddenly become huge question marks everything from identity to like planning for the future and so grieving and mourning is the process of adapting to those changes and integrating those changes into ourselves so that we can start to be optimistic start to look forward to the future and at the same time still maintain some kind of relationship with that person right because that person is going to like live within me forever so like their impact on me is going to like be there no matter what and so just learning to accept that that that you know this person even though they're gone like they're still gonna exist in the universe in some way shape or form is like the process of mourning and so successful grief you know give it like four months to a year generally speaking and and then that's really what we're shooting for okay yeah so how do you so there's a good question how do you mourn a loved one that you don't really like and i think that that process is still the same right so i know it's kind of interesting but we're making a lot of assumptions so let's say like there's a loved one that you don't like you still have to change your relationship to them so for example like if let's say you had an abusive parent so you may not like them and so you're angry with them and you had it on your mind to one day tell them exactly how you felt right you wanted you wanted to one day like tell them hey you've been really mean to me and i really dislike you i'm very angry at you and i have not forgiven you for everything that you've done to me screw you and you want to say that to them but you never had the balls to do it or call it whatever you want right ovaries so you never said those things to them and so there's some amount of resentment and like now they're gone so like there's never gonna be justice you're never gonna get to tell them so you still have to change your relationship to that person right like you you're never going to be able to tell them and so like you may tell them at their grave you may tell them at the funeral you may like write a letter and burn it you may you know write you may go piss on their grave like whatever you want to do like you can do some kind of morning attribute which still involves this sort of scientific attachment theory kind of idea of like changing your relationship to the person so mourning is like absolutely whether you like the person or dislike the person the main thing is that you adapt to their absence right that's what healthy like grief looks like it's like adapting to their absence and that can be letting go of your resentment or it can be doing you know something disrespectful to them like it can be whatever and at the same time it's also like in terms of identity formation if you had an abusive parent like a big part of that identity formation has to happen anyway for you to be healthy which is recognizing that the way that this person treated you is not actually accurate that's not who you are the way they treated you is actually inappropriate so it's absolutely relevant for people who you didn't like either right it's just major figures in your life that can be negative and then you still have to reintegrate without them so other good examples of things you know so when i've had patients who have had parents who are not the nicest a big part of that morning involves coming to terms with the fact that they will never patch up that relationship so for most kids who have parents that they don't get along with deep within them there's like a small very very like resilient desire to like patch things up right you want one day like you hope it's like this this wish that you have that one day you guys can patch things up but when someone dies like that can never happen and so it's even mourning that possibility like that hope that you have that one day i hope my parents understand one day i hope they understand one day i hope that they understand i had a patient who came out as homosexual and parents were religious and really didn't accept it and you know the poor person was just hoping one day that like their parents would come around as the world changes is like it becomes more common like one day hopefully my parents will accept me they had grandkids like you know they were hoping to be accepted and like parents were interested in the kids but not in any way so it's all kind of it gets tangled up so oftentimes even in the case of parents or the loved one that we didn't get along well with the mourning process still happens right like it still needs to happen good question so there's a good question so i'm the eldest grandchild and my younger cousins who are 18 and 13 old just lost their mother we live in kind of a joint family setup how do i help them keep being optimistic and not lose their way in the future so i think that's a fantastic question so if you're trying to help someone go through grief remember that you are a source of their identity okay so this is the main thing that i'd say so continue being that source of their identity right so like remember the way they think about themselves the way they think about the future are going to be shaped by you so you don't want to keep them being optimistic you want to let them lose their optimism and then gain it back right so if your 18 year old cousin is for example going to college like i would sit them down and say like hey are you worried about going to college and think a little bit about like um you know what would mom do for an 18 year old who's going to college like they're going to help you move into your dorm they're going to like decorate your thing they're going to buy you laundry detergent they're going to teach you how to do laundry these are all the aspects of mourning right so maybe they still have a dad in the picture and they have another parent in the picture and if they do then like you know that parent may do some of it but that parent may feel incredibly overwhelmed sending their youngest i mean oldest kid off to college so that's where like as the eldest grandchild you know you can step up some so you can offer to help them move in there's all kinds of things that mom would do so it's like it can be helpful for you to sort of step up and try to do some of those things and the signal that you're sending to them slowly is like even with this loss like your your life is going to be okay there are other people around who love you there are other people around who are going to take care of you all the things that mom can't do for you anymore like that's okay like there are other people around and i'm one of them as 18 year old or 13 year olds start to crush on people or as they start to you know like get into relationships just be there for them and so that's the cool thing is you know we said at the very beginning that every person who passes away leaves on on average nine people bereaved and the cool thing is that those nine people can come together and support each other through that loss right so it's okay for them to lose optimism but be there for them you know try to give them a positive sense of identity try to be available for them try to step up and do what the lost person may want to do but don't overdo it right let them sort of dictate so it's not like you suddenly want to step into mom's shoes and become the new mom like don't don't overdo it but be available to them someone else is asking how to mourn if it's been a long time so like the process is still the same right so why do people get stuck in prolonged morning it's because they don't do that reintegration and so how many years have passed is actually kind of relevant like it may be relevant from like a clinical perspective and diagnosing you with this or that but at the end of the day if someone comes into my office with prolonged grief like i'm gonna go through the morning process with them right we're gonna do i mean i'm not gonna lay this out laid out for them like that but you know the way i have for y'all but that's what i do in my mind right i think as someone comes into my office i start to think a little bit about okay how has this person's future changed how has this person's identity changed how is this person's life changed and then what we do in in therapy is we go through each of those things right so i'll ask them pointed questions because they may not like realize this because it's all kind of subconscious but i'll ask them like you know what are holidays like oh holidays are fine and then they start crying and it's like what and then so you know as we start to like unpack that emotion they work through holidays and then they work through the fact that at their wedding their parents weren't there because they both passed away right and then what was it like you know having your spouse have such a huge part of the family but in your wedding pictures like there was never a picture of you with your parents like what was that like and they're like it sucked it hurt i felt alone okay so like we talk about all that kind of stuff and i'll ask them how do you feel about yourself right so i'll ask questions about identity and so then it's like we work through that sense of identity and then we'll work through like what does this mean for the future you know what does this mean like are you afraid that you're gonna lose other people so sometimes like you know there'll be fears that like okay what if i wake up one day because i woke up one day and my parents were no longer there i woke up one day and down was up and up was down and then they're like what if i wake up one day and my spouse isn't around what if i wake up one day and this happens what if what if what if right and as we get to the what ifs what we move to is this right so the uncertainty so the constancy becomes the uncertainty and so in therapy we can like work through that stuff so okay so what is it like now having lost them like you know the world is an uncertain place that's scary tell me about that right and so you can still go through it years later it's totally fine it's just going through the process good question should i grief about getting bullied how exactly do i do that so you can't necessarily i wouldn't say you should grieve about getting bullied i think the right thing to grieve is the missed opportunity from the bullying right so let's assume that you're in school for example so high school maybe is supposed to be fun but since you got bullied you did not have a regular high school experience you had a bad high school experience and you didn't make friends and you didn't do this and you didn't go to prom and you didn't so like all of that stuff has to be grieved it's not the bullying itself it's the impact of the bullying on your life which like you have to acknowledge and say like yeah like other people got this and i didn't get this that really sucks for me i feel really sad how do you feel about the future how do you feel about your identity and so then the other kind of common thing so this is how some scars form for example so super common thing that i see from people get bullied is a some scar where they essentially are afraid of missing other opportunities so like if i'm bullied through high school what happens like so like you know i had a 20 year old college student for example was bullied throughout high school they weren't bullied in middle school like something weird happened in high school they just started they became the bot of a joke and then it got like it was like gigi for the rest of high school and so what they're afraid of what they're paranoid about is that like something is going to happen in college and then like college is going to be gg we're going to gg out of college because like now i'm going to be bullied at college and then like i miss this one opportunity and i'm okay with that but i'm so paranoid about college being screwed and then also like when it comes to work they're like i'm afraid that if it's like i say the wrong thing at work then everyone's gonna start making fun of me i'm gonna be the butt of the joke at work so this kind of fear that comes from this missed opportunity in high school sits with them and starts to shape their behavior paradoxically becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy because then now when they're at work like they don't make jokes because they're afraid what if people take the joke the wrong way what if they start making fun of me because i said something stupid and so as a result like they don't make many friends at work and they feel themselves being marginalized and then they get paranoid because they're like oh my god it's happening again it's happening again it's only a matter of time before they start explicitly making fun of me right so that's all some scar so the grieving process is very important because it like digests the samskar it works through all those negative emotions so then when you go to work when you go to school like you're not worried that something random will happen and you will be like marginalized and bullied for the rest of next three years good questions can you accelerate the grieving process should you i mean that depends on how fast so i'd say like you should give yourself four to six months but if you've been grieving for a few years like i would absolutely intentionally go through the process of mourning try to reintegrate yourself and like get on with your life right so this is where people may say like maybe the right how can i say this the right like twitter instagram kind of response is like everyone grieves at their own pace and you should like let them do that like yeah it's a complicated process and that's true but there's also a part of me that's sort of like if you've been grieving for six years and you're not over it yet like maybe you should accelerate the process and start living your life right like i'd say give yourself that's why that's why we added the time frame at the very beginning it's really important for people to understand that grief can last up to a year and after four to six months you should be like getting back on you know into it and why do i push people to grieve because you have life to live right so like you know go through your morning process reintegrate yourself and then start enjoying life again yeah so someone's asking a question how do i grieve being a 25 year old virgin great question so this is the important thing so the problem with 25 year old virgins is that they assume that their past performance is an indicator of like future returns right which if you guys know anything about the stock market you know you can't rely on so like this is the real problem with a lot of people who you know are 25 year old virgins is that they make assumptions about the future like i didn't realize that being a virgin at the age of 25 allowed you to see the future like you can do that like that's dope maybe that's what the celibates what's all the celibacy and yoga is about i don't mean to be unsympathetic but honestly like you know you can the trickiest thing is that you're making this critically incorrect assumption that because you haven't gotten laid at the age of 25 you're not going to get laid for the next 25 years whereas what i would say is that you haven't gotten laid until you get laid and that's just it's just a you know it'll happen at some point it happens for most people at some point and there are 24 year olds who are paranoid about it they're 18 year olds who are paranoid about it there were 15 year olds who were paranoid about it that they haven't gotten laid yet right and so things are going to happen at your own pace and should you grieve that absolutely like so you should miss out you can you can go through the process of mourning and sort of like i didn't get laid in high school didn't get laid in college now i'm 25 still haven't gotten laid like whoa it's me sure what does that mean about your identity for example right it means that oh i'm a loser like you may think those kinds of things about yourself so what does that mean for your future so all the things that we talked about are absolutely relevant here right so like let's just run through this example so accepting the loss right so like you know didn't get laid accepting the consequence of the loss right so i don't know exactly what that is but let's go to identity for a second you know so you may identify as an incel or forever alone right so this changes your sense of identity it changes your relationship to the object of loss so sometimes people will start to have resentment towards the opposite sex or same sex depending on you know where you are in the hetero homosexual spectrum restore the capacity to thrive this is absolutely something you need to do right look to the future with happiness and optimism absolutely something you need to do this is where you know so i think that like the morning process is very important here right because like it maps on really really well and this is why i like this as opposed to the kubler raw stages of grief like it seems to map on to non-death related morning processes but should you mourn absolutely no question because the truth is that as you go through that healthy integration like you'll be able to as you deal with the resentment that you have towards the people that you know you didn't get laid with you'll set yourself up to like have healthier relationships right so i think it's very important this is where the person may feel a sense of identity like i'm a loser because i haven't gotten laid at the age of 25 whereas like that's not necessarily true it's just you just haven't had sex it doesn't that's it right that doesn't say anything about who you are it's just an experience that you haven't had like you know i've never been scuba diving doesn't say anything about my identity except for the thing like is scuba diving cool sure absolutely do i want to do it sounds great but that's just that's all it is you
