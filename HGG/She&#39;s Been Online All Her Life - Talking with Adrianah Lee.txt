when you sort of look at yourself what I'm kind of hearing is that like a lot of negativity comes up and so the only time that you end up looking at yourself is when you feel overwhelmed in some other direction and then it's like an outpouring okay hello hi um and and what do you go by Adriana or Adriana okay what would you prefer I call you today um Adrian okay well it's nice to meet you Adriana um I just wanted to uh start by expressing my appreciation I was I'm sorry I know a couple weeks ago you had uh you were in our chat and I didn't quite see it at the time but I I really appreciate you kind of reaching out and offering to have a conversation about um you know what a lot of the challenges that people in The Gaming Community face uh and was just kind of curious a little bit about what you wanted to talk about today um I mostly wanted to talk about um sexual harassment and assault in male-dominated spaces and how it's very like sorry my focus it's kind of normalized unfortunately and it's like really sad sorry if you heard a little it's really sad so yeah yeah I I I'd love to have that conversation with you and and try to learn what we can from your experience and hopefully like make the world a safer place um and and just to kind of clarify so so are you looking to like process trauma or do anything like that today on stream okay so we're having a conversation around sexual assault and harassment and um the goal is to try to like raise awareness and and or at least that's what I you know I'm hoping for um and to hear a little bit about your experience does that sound okay with you okay so this is not therapy I'm not your therapist or anything like that right okay um so yeah so Adriana can you start by just telling me a little bit about like uh you know why this topic is important to you and and what your experience of it with has has been um topic is important to me because um I have experienced sexual assault um multiple times throughout my life oh my God even though I've taken preventative measures as much as I can and um and it's it's something that happened to me when I was really young but I didn't realize it until I was older and then after that it was just hard to explain I guess it's just something that I kind of went through and I was like okay that sucks that I went through this and I just tried to push it down as much as I could because I just wanted to move on with my life I didn't want to have to feel that over and over again um but then it started to affect my relationships and then it started to affect um just a lot of things and what really made me realize like I can't suffer like alone in silence is um when I started to have people in my chat like mostly young women who you know trauma dumping is a normal thing for people to do in chats I don't encourage it I don't think anybody ever should but it happens every so often you just kind of have to be like hey like please don't do that but once I started to hear can can I just jump in there for a second can you tell me what trauma dumping is trauma dumping is like when you go like in chats is when you go into someone's chat and you just start like sharing some really hard experiences that you went through um a lot of people do it to streamers in order to like seek like help from them um and so what I have heard from a lot of people is more common than not like that is a shared experience for a lot of us women especially in um like this community of twitch of gaming so it once I realized that it was really hard for me to just like stay silent about my experiences and I needed to speak up so I started you know generally speak up but I never really brought anything to attention before and the reason why this recent thing was brought to attention a while ago was because somebody that you should be my friend actually like brought it to attention and then I had to deal with not only my own processing of things but trying to feel like I'm fighting so hard to validate my story yeah so um Adrian I'm kind of noticing that we're sort of like talking around stuff right so so you're kind of saying yeah bring it to attention I don't really know what what it is um and well before we kind of jump into that so so a couple of things you know you're you don't have to share anything that you're not comfortable sharing first of all it's okay to talk or like in vague terms if that's what you feel comfortable doing uh I know that from my perspective I I would certainly benefit from a little bit more clarity because you're kind of talking about it happens and I'm not sure what it is you also mentioned um that you've been kind of suffering alone and that this has been happening for you uh to you for a while um and so I'm curious do you feel comfortable like going into a little bit more detailed not not like all the details of what happened or a play-by-play but just like what are What specifically are we talking about is that okay to talk about yeah okay so there's an incident involving another streamer um that happened a while ago and it was where I ended up um falling asleep at a party and the other streamer ended up trying to touch me and ended up touching me and after multiple times of my friends saying hey she's okay please leave her alone please leave her alone he just kept trying to come back into the room um when I first heard that information I was obviously really uncomfortable and I just didn't like want to make a big deal or whatever because that's usually what most people um do in that situation especially when the other person is a lot bigger than you in terms of numbers and growth in feel that you really want to succeed in so can you help me understand that what you said you didn't want to make a big deal what is making a big deal look like making a big deal can mean really anything even just saying like hey that was really uncomfortable because even if you just say that all of a sudden who are you saying that to to anybody in public okay or to even the person who did that okay because the minute that happens is the minute like um fingers are pointed there's a lot of victim blaming involved and you have to keep reliving it over and over again what do you mean by victim blaming um a lot of people especially recently they don't want to hold people accountable so they will blame the victim or the Survivor in this case um for oh well what like things that are most common like what were you wearing um what other kind of questions and by the way if I'm interrupting you too much please let me know oh that's fine um but I I think this is exactly like in my mind this is exactly why we're having this conversation because I think people will use phrases like victim blaming but I don't even know that the majority of people out there know what that looks like know what the experience of it is I think victim blaming is when you are sexually assaulted um you already have that very intense feeling of Shame and guilt because it's not something that it's something that you feel like your own body and your own rights to your body have been taken away from you so when you already feel that shame and guilt you're all ready for me trying to guilt yourself oh well I guess I shouldn't have done this oh I guess I shouldn't have done that like like well I shouldn't have done that like I'm already blaming myself because it's like I just wish that didn't happen to me and I wish that things gone differently but then once you start hearing other people blame you you just start feeling more and more guilt and it takes so it took me so long to process that it wasn't my fault and what the reason a lot of people don't come out about these things is it's a common feeling to feel that shame and that guilt and when um you know it takes a while to process that it's not your fault but then once they process that and they're like okay now I should share my story sharing your story opens up the door for more people to put that shame and that guilt you're originally feeling back onto you that you back onto yeah so it kind of just reopens the womb and that's why it's just really hard and that's why a lot of people don't Express their stories so can you help me understand what your experience of being when people victim blamed what that looked like or you know what did they say what did they do what was your experience of it um in the two times that has happened to me um it's kind of like oh well you shouldn't have drank oh well you shouldn't have talked to him oh well to him yeah I've heard everything so you shouldn't have put yourself in that position in what position was that what are they referring to when they say that position being at a party I shouldn't have gone to a party exactly and it's hard because like I've already told myself these things for so long so when they say it what is what does that do I mean if you've been telling yourself that for so long and and now you're hearing it from other people how does that affect you um it obviously in this situation I feel like it's put me in like state of um disassociation because um the first time the story came out I've heard so much of it and it sent me into like a really bad depression um but this time I feel like like disassociating almost like I don't even know what I feel really like it's hard to sounds like you feel numb like yeah it's hard to determine my feelings but every so often within the past two three weeks that this has been up for discussion on the internet um I've had like a couple like big breakdowns but then it just goes back to the numb okay so when you said that when this came out so it sounds like you did not speak up first can you help me understand that whole thing I yeah I didn't speak up about it because I knew the person was more powerful than me and um I knew I my dream was to just you know be sure to be a content creator and I moved all the way to Austin to do it and I was like it's fine you know I'm just gonna put my head down and you know not interact with this person and I'm just going to continue to live my life and um then how did somebody sorry everything that you say has I I get so curious and I want to learn more so I'll pause and let you finish I'm sorry okay um so somebody I used to be friends with ended up speaking about it on her stream um and we weren't friends at the time when she spoke about it we she had me blocked on Twitter but then she unblocked me she's like I spoke about this and I was like oh so I was kind of like pushed into something I wasn't ready to talk about um and yeah and then I was kind of like not ready it wasn't really like ready in my brain to talk about it or process it so I was in a very vulnerable state when I was like getting spam called and like rushed to make a statement about it there was people who came over to convince me or to tell me like I need to say something I need to say something and I just wasn't like really ready to say anything do you but I had to why why did you have to say something um because everyone was the people who knew that it happened that I was that person you talked about um they ended up like calling me a lot spam calling me and then um I ended up going to my friend's house to talk to him about it and maybe think about making a twit longer and then they came over and they're like okay how are we gonna do this how are we gonna address this it was like a boardroom meeting or whatever and I was like okay like and I had the intention that these people were there to like help me but I I found out a couple weeks later that that wasn't the case but in the moment I thought they were there to help me can I think for a second of course so the first thing there's so much about this Adriana that I think makes a lot of sense and there's so much about this that completely perplexes me so the first thing that's kind of confusing for me is like I need to make a statement says who like I'm so and I'm not saying I I can it's very clear to me that you are under a lot of pressure I'm guessing that other people felt like they were under a lot of pressure you know there's this sort of idea that we have to like advocate for people who are victims right like we've got to like seek Justice I mean like I I think that there's a lot of good sentiment there but what I'm kind of noticing is that first of all like you didn't ask for the conversation and once the conversation got started you weren't really mentally in a place to make a statement but I'm also hearing that like that was somehow unacceptable that it wasn't being addressed can you help me understand that like where is that pressure coming from what are people like thinking what why do you feel like you have to make a statement there's a couple of things that were going through my mind that day um I'm just trying to I kind of like compartmentalized this day after especially this past couple weeks but um the main thing that was happening was um a lot of panic a lot of people specifically people that the person was friends with saying we need to find this girl we need to talk to this girl we need to hear the truth or whatever and um so there's just a big Panic on the internet trying to like see like who is this girl like what is this and like there's a lot of pressure knowing that that was me and and I knew it was wrong so when you knew what was wrong approached the original assault or so something yeah being touched when I was asleep okay um so and I and I didn't really want anybody to go through that experience so as I was sitting in the little Board Room I was hearing a bunch of different things people telling me like are you sure are you sure are you sure and like what are you what are you hearing when people say that or ask that question doubt that like of what happened to me so especially when they're like well we know our friend we know our friend like and they would say those they wouldn't do that yeah so how do you deal with that when when people are doubting you and saying we know our friend how what what happens in your mind or what happens in the in someone's mind in that situation just as I said it like re it brings up like the feelings I originally felt of like guilt and shame because it's like like wow this person did this thing to me that's actually horrible but if I say something like I'm gonna ruin their life and it's like it like makes me feel almost bad in that moment but then once I clear my head I'm like I don't want this to happen to anybody else like no one deserves to feel like their body isn't theirs you know but in that moment when these people are saying that's our friend like this is what's gonna happen to him if you do this like he's gonna have to get kicked out we're gonna have to like not be his friend anymore it's almost like they're re-dating that feeling of guilt and they're putting it in other places like making me feel bad like oh if I say something about the truth then it's my fault because then they have to lose their friend or they have to kick them out or whatever so then it's just reinstating that feeling of guilt and putting it in other places so I mean what is it like to this question may be weird but I'm kind of noticing like almost like a weird shift in the power Dynamic and the responsibility Dynamic right like who's responsible for this that in that moment I'm hearing people kind of so what happens now and who's responsible for ruining the life is you right like if you speak up like you have the power Adriana you have the power to make this go away yeah so yeah go ahead we're not like I'm hearing that it's like like I don't know what to do you know and then in that moment I'm thinking about all the girls in my chat who just play Minecraft on stream and we're constantly like harassed by men in chat who have expressed this to me I'm thinking about all these young girls who've experienced these things in their college campuses and they can't say anything or people who've experienced these things at work because I've heard like a lot of stories and it's like if I don't say anything and just let this like go and you know um then it would almost make me feel bad too so it's like if I don't say anything I feel like I have this platform that was given to me I have these people who look up to me and I'm I'm doing them wrong but then if I do say something then I'm doing the bigger people who can really make or break someone's career I'm doing them wrong so I was like okay we'll find a middle point that way you know I'll dumb down my story but I'll still say it what do you mean by that way your story like I will make in terms of the boardroom meeting thing whatever the hell that you want to call that meet up so you were like in a room with a bunch of people who let me understand were your friends we're not your friends let's go like one of them were my friend and then another one of my friends came home from work um and then well I guess there was like one okay two of the people that were there lived there like the one person and the person came from work they lived there and they were there in the room when it happened and they were my friends that I trust and then the three other people who came over one of them was like an acquaintance well two of them were like acquaintances um and one of them I didn't know it all um and they came over how did they how did they cut I'm so confused like do they just show up or someone invited them or like yeah well they showed up because one of the acquaintances was friends with my friend okay so they knew where he lived and they told him we're gonna come over and he was in a meeting when that happened so he wasn't able to tell me I was upstairs getting ready in the bathroom or like in my friend's vanity and um he wasn't able to tell me hey they're coming over so I'm doing my makeup whatever and I just hear their voices downstairs I'm like oh my God like I'm already going through so much stress right now like now this is happening and I was like texting my friends at the time because I tried to like revisit the feelings after like you know so much time has passed and I like went through my old Discord of like me talking to my friend because they're like really like good friends of this one person at the time still friends with him and um I was like oh my gosh like I'm so stressed out and now these people are here like this is just such a hectic day like I didn't really want all this happen yeah and then noticing how completely out of control you are in this situation like yeah so then you know I talked to all them and that was pretty much what I was did you dealt with did you feel like you could say I mean did you want to talk to anyone in that room no the only person I really wanted to talk to and I thought I was going to talk to that day were my two friends that were there in the room when it happened and that like are my friends that I trust they're a couple so I that was my only people that I wanted to talk to that day and then it just kind of and so you felt like you couldn't say I don't want to talk about this with acquaintance and one person that like you couldn't say that all right and I recognize that may sound like victim blaming as well but I'm I'm not saying I'm not suggesting that you should have said that what I'm trying to really do is understand like in that moment because that is that like you know what was going through your head it's kind of like like they were like oh like we need to figure this out we need to figure this out and like they were like almost like I don't know if this is a good analogy or not but like a courtroom and like they had to represent like their side you know that's kind of what it felt like and it almost felt like I was like at the stand like being like no like this is what happened and um that's why it was hard because it was like an ultimatum it's like hey you can say something and then we would kick our friend out and then you probably won't get invited to parties and then like people are probably gonna hate on you whatever but then you can like not say something or you can just be anonymous and then like we can figure it out from there and then I was like okay and then I was like so I was dealt with that thing that was like okay do I use my platform and stick up for people in my audience because at this point like this is a broader scale of um like an issue or do I do what these bigger streamers want me to do you know so that's how we kind of met in the middle but even the middle wasn't like my full truth because a lot of the wording wasn't as strong as I wanted it to be and it didn't really reflect what I was feeling um but that's why everything got brought to light within the past two or three weeks um and I was able to say my full truth because of that so Adriana I want to point out a couple of things and if I say anything that is out of line or upsets you or is not in the direction that you want to talk please let me know the last thing that I want to do is railroad you into a conversation that you don't want to have first thing is that I'm noticing that when you're thinking about how to proceed in this situation you're thinking about your community and you're thinking about streamers for lack of a better term what I'm I'm it's mostly like sorry to interrupt but it's like my career or like these young girls that look up to me yeah yeah so so that that's what's kind of interesting to me is like I don't hear even in that choice I don't hear you what about you yeah I guess it's like I didn't really okay sorry I'm whenever I like to pause I'm just trying to not like cry or anything but it's hard to like see it for myself because I just don't want it to like be on myself you know because it's like I went through these hard feelings and it's like I don't know I don't want to see myself as a victim as much as like I guess I am you know it's hard to like see myself as that or like admit that I guess to myself because then it's like it's true you know and I I don't know it's like I have a hard time like digesting it I guess because then it just kind of brings back like those feelings that were first felt after these like situations so I just kind of wanted to think like okay I'm gonna do this for someone else because I don't want anybody else to feel like this so I guess it's about me but it's not really about me because it's like it happened to me but what can I do to prevent this from happening to anybody else because these feelings like or something I have to process like on my own and me coming out with anything yeah it makes me feel happy if I have Justice but it's not going to make the incident go away and it's not going to make the feelings go away so that's why it's like when you come out about these things it's not it's not for me it's for these other girls or anybody really that regardless of gender that deal with these things and feel like they can't say anything or feel like they're alone this is gonna sound weird Adriana but respectfully I kind of disagree and here's here's why so you're looking out for other people that's awesome right like people need to speak but what I'm saying is like who's looking out for you right like what like I don't know right so like it and that's kind of what I mean I don't maybe disagree was wrong but like it's like I'm hearing the same thing again and like what I'm wondering about is like right here thinking about making the world a better place for other people right like gotta make the world a better place like that's why we're having this conversation to raise awareness and educate people and then there's your career reputations ruining lives all that kind of stuff what I'm wondering is like where is the care for you I don't know I'm not gonna lie to you I don't know and and it because because it sounds like when I ask you a little bit about that you know you talk about like well if I'm focusing on me like then then it opens up the whole like victim camera can of worms and I have to deal with the victim it becomes more real to you right like it so it sounds like as long as you're focused on other people then it it's more it feels like it's more tolerable yeah I guess so and that just makes me kind of sad that in in this whole conversation like I'm not hearing anyone care about you yeah but I don't know I wish I could I wish I had something to say I normally have things to say but I don't really have anything to say to that because I guess I've never heard it from that perspective yeah you don't have to say anything you know I I okay yeah I and I was just sharing an observation I wasn't like asking a question like it's something that no yeah yeah um is it okay that I said that or asked that question yeah for sure I just wish that I knew how to respond to it but I don't okay do you feel like you yeah hold on let me think for a second because I guess even like being here it's like I'm not doing it for me either yeah you know it's like even being on here like I was like okay I'm gonna go on Dr K and I'm gonna talk about these things and how I feel or how I felt in this situation so other people can realize that I'm human and that there are humans that go through these things it's not just drama Andy lsf political whatever War it's like human feelings and like trauma and it is hard to deal with and I feel like when I go through my life I just push it aside and only in moments of weakness like mental breakdowns I kind of let it all out and I know it's really unhealthy but um there's like certain things that will also like trigger those responses I guess and like as I said before that's why it's hard to be in romantic relationships or have intimate connections with people because of my past with trauma um like just certain muscle memory will trigger really bad episodes for me and it's it's not a fun thing to deal with and I don't really want anybody to have to deal with this because I'm still trying to figure out how to deal with it myself sorry if I just was rambling I'm just trying to find the right words to say do you feel like you were rambling well I mean obviously yeah I thought it came across as very clear can I share with you what I heard let me think for a second whether I want to give you the cliff notes version or the okay so I'll give you the long so like so first of all I get the sense that you feel kind of like uncentered and that you kind of don't have time to deal with this crap you have a life to live and work to do with streaming and the only time that when you sort of look at yourself what I'm kind of hearing is that like a lot of negativity comes up and so the only time that you end up looking at yourself is when you feel overwhelmed in some other direction and then it's like an outpouring like a spiral and so since you have difficulty with Intimacy in relationships right that certainly doesn't make your life easier and then then it's kind of like well I gotta you know figure out all the [ __ ] upness on the inside before I can go and engage with other people but I don't quite know how to do that I don't really know where to do that when to do that but still there's this idea that like the fixing that needs to happen has to happen like you have to do it yeah right and and that it needs to be fixed before you like show someone what's on the inside of Adriana because it's all like a mess down there is kind of the sense that I'm getting kind of it's it's kind of like for me it's more of the fear that it's never going to be fixed in that you know I'm not gonna I don't want to put the time and effort I guess into not that kind of sounds bad but like I don't want to in my brain it feels like a pity party and I don't want to put that negative energy I guess into myself because I you know I have a lot of things to do as you said like I work a lot and I like before I was a streamer I worked three jobs and um it's just like it's kind of like I have my moments of weakness and I've used like certain things just to try to like like snap out of it like where I would be like literally not to like I feel like I'm trauma dumping but like like I would have these moments of weakness where I would be like in my worst mental state possible mental breakdown on the bathroom floor and I'd be like oh my gosh I have to stream I have to stream like I told people I was going live today so I would do whatever I had available to me to make myself in a better mood to stream like a lot of caffeine um a lot of yeah um caffeine um my prescribed like Adderall just whatever I was like gave me that boost that's like okay like stop it's time to go live like stop so no more pity parties for Adriana got [ __ ] to do yeah yeah so I even have this thing on my goddamn monitor that it sounds so stupid it says 4m's manic manifesting money Eminem because I remember I listened to Eminem and it like helped me I guess get out of my sadness so Adriana it's wonderful to see a genuine smile on your face thanks I don't know but yeah it's just like I don't know I just wanted to like trigger a manic I guess is how I would perceive it yeah so I would just be like [ __ ] everybody it's fine I'm gonna work and um yeah all right you know you you tossed out a couple of things that I can't really let slip by no go ahead um so one is you kind of mentioned that when you sort of try to work on yourself or maybe you try to help yourself it feels kind of like a pity party and you also sort of mentioned that like you kind of don't want to waste your time on something that's not really fixable yeah and so I'm kind of just noticing that maybe you feel like kind of busted how how do you understand like how long have you felt that way um I guess for a while because it doesn't even have to do with this more recent situation maybe like because back when I was I'd really like rough upbringing I guess and um I've always had these like Panic moments and um after okay I'm sorry this is like really like deep and graphic But like after the first time I was ever sexually assaulted and I didn't realize that that's what it was I was um 14. and I had a very rough household environment um my like my parents um they weren't together but like my mom had custody of me and it wasn't she wasn't very nice to say the least I won't get into details with that but um I kind of like always had to put on a smile for her you know because if I showed weakness in front of her it would not be about me anymore so I couldn't express my feelings I guess in a healthy way in in my household so what I would do growing up is I would always reserve my crying for the bathroom because I could lock the door and I could turn on the shower so no one would hear me so after the first time I was it's actually salted when I was 14. um it was kind of a ripple of events that happened I experienced a deep depression for the first time throughout like the span of those months and I ended up picking up very bad habits to try to cope with that and I could not tell anybody I couldn't tell my mom because she wouldn't believe me and I ended up after a while of doing with these bad habits that were just harder and harder to cover up I expressed it to my stepfather and we tried to get help from me um but then I ended up like going to a mental hospital and then I wasn't really able to get the care that I needed because like it was my stepdad and wasn't like my mom so it's like my mom was like you're just doing this for attention and she would just tell me all the time like you're just doing this for attention and I was like okay well and I I wasn't really able to get the help that I needed until I was 17 because when I was 17 when I first turned 17. so that was when I was 14 15 as the depression then when I turned 17 I got cut off financially so I had to pay for like my own food and whatever else I just still lived with my parents because I didn't have a choice but then after a couple months I was able to move out and go to university and um like I had to figure out like what's the word like when you like are again all odds are against you but you still like go through it like you still like Triumph I don't know perseverance I don't know perseverance so I had to persevere I guess through all this and um because like my parents didn't do taxes so I had to like do pay for college all the way up front like no loans or anything so I just worked really hard and I like overworked myself and it was very unhealthy to myself but I was able finally get therapy especially because I had to because I want to bring my birds in my dorm because I had pet birds and I needed a therapist to register them as an emotional support animal so therapy helped me a lot and it helped me really be mindful and understand my feelings um and mostly my childhood it helped me unpack that a lot so realizing even now realizing that growing up if I expressed my feelings or weakness or whatever around my own family it wasn't it wasn't perceived well and it wasn't a good outcome so I guess that made this habit now that I have of expressing my feelings and big bursts at a time usually alone well all always alone because I don't I'm embarrassed for anybody else to see it um you keep on using this term weakness can you help me understand what that means like I guess I feel weak when I let myself like Express these emotions because I guess it's not the strong thing to do and you know sometimes I'll cry on stream but it's not the same thing as like a spiral you know I'm not afraid to like Cry on My Stream whether I'm happy or like maybe a little bit sad but like a spiral is like a lot different if that makes sense yeah I'm just trying to process your facial reactions sorry I might try not to cry yeah I see that so so I'm I'm not sure exactly since you're not trying to I'm gonna try to do what you're trying to do which means I have to be careful about what I ask you can ask whatever oh I know I can but like do I want to right because here you because like I mean I and I I think honestly like I didn't think that was like a you know I didn't think that was a sometimes we ask like powerful questions like oh my God like you know like well ask questions like oh my God but I I was just I was just pointing out something about you know the language that you use which is like this term of weakness and then this whole thing is like right under the surface yeah I guess that's why I don't talk about it because when you shine the spotlight on me a bunch of things just fall out yeah so so then I'm not you know and if if a theme of of today is like being unprepared for conversations and not forcing people into being you know so so I'm I'm just trying to think a little bit about like because I can I think for a second yes so what I'm hearing is that you feel weak and that you carry that feeling you've carried it with you for a long time um I'm also hearing like some really bizarre stuff like going to a mental hospital for attention and and what that kind of makes me wonder is like who is that you know when someone says you're doing it for attention usually what that means is you're taking attention away from me right which is like no we're not I'm not having a mental breakdown to try to you know take attention away from you like believe it or not yeah maybe the reason I'm having a mental breakdown is because I'm struggling in some way and I actually don't give two shits about who anyone is paying attention to I'm just managing I'm having trouble managing my internal environment yeah you look like you're about to say something yeah I mean like even me wanting to defend that it's like yeah oh yeah it's it's me it's me like really feeling like I have to defend it like oh well actually yeah because but I don't I don't have to but I just I feel like I do because I feel like I have to be like oh well like I really wasn't doing it for attention because even these harmful things I was doing I was oh I would always hide like I didn't let anybody see them yet there's a lot of stuff like Adriana that that I'm hearing that kind of makes me think a little bit like one is so you tend to use the passive voice a lot so like so that means that like you'll say like you you didn't say I persevered you'll say something like I was able to persevere like any time you talk about one of your successes you it's never I plus verb and then it's it's always like well after I moved out things happened and I was able to go to college but you don't say like I worked my ass off and paid my way through school which is what it sounds like so I I guess yeah it's like I guess I only feel like that when I'm in like a high high I guess I'm gonna show my phone like in a high high I feel like oh yeah like yeah I did that but then like when I'm not in that I feel I guess yeah I feel like it's a lot of like right now there is a lot of pressure on me because people are finding any way to discredit me as a person in my experiences and that's why it's really hard because it's really hard like everything is being looked under under a microscope so it's like I can sit here and be like hey like I I was really sad or I'm sad and then they'll be like yeah well here's a picture of you having fun like three months ago so you're clearly not sad because look at this photo of you smiling and it's like bruh like it's just it's like ridiculous the the things that our people are saying but I guess it just reopens that kind of thing I've dealt with throughout my childhood of like oh well you're just doing it for attention you know yeah I mean that's I'm kind of curious though what what it's what's it like having your life under a microscope I mean I've always had my life on the internet so I've always you know been conscious of that but at the same time I I grew up on the internet I grew up streaming I started streaming on Twitch when I was 18 but I was streaming on you now throughout my childhood and like throughout my teen life and like playing guitar I was really 13 years old playing guitar on YouNow and um you know I I always had to be conscious of like my internet life I guess and my my life was just always on the internet and then I started streaming for fun when I was 18. just because I wanted someone or on Twitch because I wanted someone to talk to because I was really lonely and I just got out of a breakup and I was in university alone because I didn't have a roommate and um I would just you know meet some internet friends I had a really good time and I always want to be a YouTuber so I'd always just be like what's in front of my YouTube guys I'm not a streamer I want to be a YouTuber and then I ended up really liking streaming and wanted to be a streamer so so what's it sorry that was kind of off track yeah that's totally fine how do you feel when you go off track bad I guess because I I should probably be focused well so yeah so we're gonna try to learn a lesson today Adriana and this maybe arrogant or paternalistic for me to say but I have a wild idea like whatever you feel like talking about is the right thing to talk about so I guess it's just everything I do now it makes me feel like okay what are they gonna say about it you know like like even my friends joke about it like I was like oh this is my outfit for today and my friend's like oh my gosh you're gonna wear the color red people are gonna start being like she wore bread for a reason she wore red because it's the color of this this is and then like just like nitpick literally everything like even my friends like realize it so they just joke about it all the time because yo that's I mean because you talk about being under a microscope I'm almost hearing that you're kind of like being dissected like when people are like oh my God look at the attention grabbing she's doing with that red outfit yeah oh my God can you believe her the nerve the nerve that's that's exactly what it's like of wearing clothing like oh my God she listens to Katy Perry well Katy Perry had a song about sex once so it explains a lot why Adriano is like doing all these things so it's like bro yeah Katy Perry push her in the back that's that's the reference what how do you how do you I was about to ask how does that make you feel but what I'm wondering is like how the [ __ ] do you deal with that like what do you what do you do in that like I don't know I really don't that's the thing I don't know what to do and I'm I'm it's like Gary because I'm like almost scared for my safety at some points because of like the things I read and I just my friend's like don't look at that don't look at that and they just like make sure I don't but it's like it's almost like harassment the way people like I can't be I tweeted like happy bisexual visibility day because it was my sexual visibility day and I'm bisexual and I know a lot of people in my community that are as well and then everyone's like oh yeah you're bisexual that explains a lot and then they just start like it's like I can't even explain I don't that's what I'm saying like these people just draw anything from like left field is that the right analogy sure I think I understand what you're they pull it out of their ass is that what you're yeah okay because I understand why like and I don't even know if it's right of me to put myself in their perspective you know like I'm like saying like why would they think that and I'm like trying to put myself in perspective from what I understand I understand why they're upset that maybe someone they looked up to did something bad and they don't want to they don't want that to be the truth so they're trying to find any reason why maybe it wouldn't be the truth or maybe why they would cut them their their favorite streamer or some slack you know it's so that's I guess that's how I'm trying yeah I was about to say that sounds like that's how you understand their response that's how I'm trying to understand it so I don't I guess I could take it so personally I see because it's easy to take it personally it's easy if I'm in the weak mindset as I say to myself I know you said you don't like me saying that but like when I'm not sure everything's fine you're using language that I don't like is that okay yeah you're damn right it is so when I'm not in that mindset I just like breeze chilling whatever but then when it something triggers me to be in that mindset everything starts being personal everything starts being harmful to me and I start being like Oh like these people are calling me like [ __ ] and [ __ ] maybe they're right and I just I take it really personally and but that's not most of the time it's just in those moments so and it's um it's hard because throughout and even saying this is just giving me an ammo but I'm gonna say anyways because I've said these things on my stream before and they'll probably find it so throughout being on my own at 17 and coming from a family I feel didn't love me and not just and they're like well my family didn't love me like in like an actual like like I don't know you know what I mean it's it's like my parents kind of cut me off and I kind of had to fend for myself so I really just didn't feel that love and just because like throughout my childhood it was like as I stated before like hard to feel accepted for who I am so I would go as far as the impossible but just my thought okay so I um I was just searching for love anywhere I guess and when people showed me that affection I didn't want to lose them so I had a really intense fear of Abandonment and um my I wasn't like I was in a like kind of bad relationship that wasn't very kind to say the least and it was kind of like he would always yell at me and be really mean to me um but I just thought it was normal because that's kind of how I was raised so I'm like this is love because this is uh my parents showed me a lot so and um then he ended up cheating on me but I wanted to make things work out because I didn't want to lose him I had that figured abandonment but then after a while I just kind of it's like whatever so then I was in college I was on my own and I was just navigating on my own and I just ended up in situations that I thought were like good for me but they weren't because I was looking for like love in the wrong places or whatever and can you helped me understand where where is love in the wrong place and where's love in the right place uh yeah let me I I wrote about this because I wanted to say I guess I just kind of writing on my feelings because I was in like my weaker moment so I wanted to make sure um can I ask I got my feelings oh okay what okay so um I wrote this throughout my independent life I struggled with being used and at the time I just thought I was being normal and spontaneous but looking back I realized the situations I put myself in because I had to grow up really early that's what I wrote so it's kind of like after a while and a lot of obviously therapy I process like hey that's not really a good thing you know and I realized like that's not where I should be looking for love and like I it and then after I stopped doing that um it's kind of like my perspective like let me just put an example for people who might not be understanding of this is like I would go this guy guy would text me hey you look so pretty and so cute like we should totally hang out and I'm like totally I would love to hang out and then we hang out and then he puts his arm around me I'm like whoa this guy really likes me and then he says something like wow you're so good at playing guitar because maybe I'll play the guitar for him or something and I'd be like wow he likes me for who I am and then we would partake in activities that were consensual and I'd be like wow now he's really gonna like me and then he would ghost me but then maybe a couple days later he'd come back and be like yo like let's watch a movie and I'm like oh my God yes this guy really likes me because he hit me up two days later we're gonna go hang out again and then here just like say things like wow like you look so pretty and like just like things I'm like oh my God he really likes me and then it would go again and I'll be like okay and then and after a while presumably partake in more consensual activities yeah exactly so after a while like then he would eventually ghost me or whatever and like start doing it to another girl so it's like okay whatever um you know [ __ ] boy College activities so it took me a while to realize like I guess I'm better than that and not to fall for it I guess but how did you realize that yes every I guess I don't know like a lot of self-reflection and like actually one of them was actually getting in a relationship and like reflecting because when I was in a relationship when I was like you know yeah I reflected on like the past and I was like damn and obviously my partner at the time was like you didn't deserve that and I was like you know what maybe I didn't maybe I didn't deserve that can you hold on one second yeah I am going to DM you real quick and I want you to check your DMs okay oh it's okay okay sure yeah um yeah yeah okay okay keep going oh so then yeah so it made me feel like you know I um I realized that you know I was looking for the wrong places and this was like when I was like 18 when all this happened so then I'm 19 and I'm like okay I I get moving to a house and like I'm like living my life and I have like this newfound knowledge or whatever so um Newfound knowledge that you're a decent human being who deserves love yeah and then I'm like I'm focusing on my career I want to be a streamer really bad and um then I didn't realize like being able to here's where it's kind of deep I didn't realize being able to partake in like sexual activities consensually before that was probably gonna be the last time I'd be able to do that comfortably sadly because then um I ended up being sexually assaulted in terms of rape um and around that time so it was like oh you know and I obviously didn't process it so I was just like whatever you know that happened it's whatever like um I almost like I was I don't know like I just wanted to not really feel it and I just kind of like was like oh whatever like my fault like shouldn't have done that like shouldn't have gone to that party shouldn't have put myself in that situation you know and then right after that and like not even a month later is when um the situation happened with the streamer and even when I was at that party I'm like okay I'm with my friends and I'm safe like these are the people I went with and these are the people who are going to be with me throughout the night so these people are going to protect me and they did because you know things happened that were bad but like I don't want to say it could have been worse because people used that as an argument well well he didn't do all this so it doesn't make it okay um but the people that were there to protect me and keep an eye on me that night ended up doing so and I'm really grateful for that because like my mind wanders all the time of like it could have been worse but it still doesn't make my feelings invalid and it still doesn't make it okay and that's what I feel like a lot of people fail to realize yeah so yeah how you doing right now I'm okay I don't know honestly okay it just feels like it feels like I don't I can't process it sure and not that I don't want to I'm I can't because I need to do the right thing first what is the right thing like I guess speaking out and raising awareness who is that the right thing for um a lot of women and men who have experienced these things who maybe don't even realize it or who feel like they can't tell anyone is it the right thing for you yeah I think I'm very glad that it's finally being talked about because at the end of the day it was so much harder to be quiet about it to be like forced to be quiet about it and to see people that I thought were my friends and for many years who had my side randomly just turn on me and be like oh well actually this person's gonna help my career and you're not and it's like damn it was so painful and it was painful when I would share the story to people in the scene like hey like this is something that I'm really upset about and it's something that is really wrong and they would sit there and be like yeah that's that's [ __ ] up Asia I'm sorry and then continue to go hang out with that person or maybe Farm reactions under their tweets so and I get it it's just business but it's hard because it's so invalidating you've mentioned kind of career power dynamics um you know people it sounds like you feel quite abandoned by friends of yours for the sake of them kind of advancing their career do you feel uh up to talking about what that experience has been like for you and how you make sense of this all the stuff that's going on yeah it's like it happened with a lot of people so it'd be people like even I was really close friends with and randomly one day I see them hanging out with him and it's like hey remember when I would literally cry to you and express my feelings to you on how unfair this situation was and how hard it was for me and you've expressed some more things that have happened to you and then it's like then it just feels like you weren't really listening it feels like they weren't really listening or they just didn't really care and I understand because it's like I really understand putting your career first because I was unfortunately like putting trying to save my career when it first came out and the woman gave me like an ultimatum like oh like you want to protect your career or you wanna who's beautiful I mean actually you don't have to name people but I I yeah I'm gonna ask the person in the room the boardroom okay got it okay so I was like whip so when I was given the ultimatum I guess I was semi selfish and and trying to meet in the middle because I did want to protect my career but I still want to say something but I still want to protect my career and I guess I couldn't have my cake and eat it too because then it just ended up both things going down the drain I ended up losing both I wasn't able to say my full truth and my career went down the drain because I was blacklisted from these events and rumors were spread about me and it's really unfair because I lost a lot of friends that I originally moved across the country for and it's really sad like I moved all the way here just for we'll lose these friends because somebody decided to touch me when I was asleep like it's so clear-cut it's like I was asleep like I was asleep like I don't understand how people are like well like I try to put me in any other situation I was literally asleep like I I tried to emphasize that so much because I don't feel like people are listening and like when I hear people go against it's like what like I was asleep like how is there any way that I could have consented when I was asleep so that was just really frustrating but the main thing that was really frustrating is hearing these rumors about me and um like one of the rumors I heard from someone I have not even talked to who ended up being close friends with that um person like I heard it from a friend so it's like give a telephone but I heard that I am like a [ __ ] who tries to sleep with all the Austin streamers and that like I'm a [ __ ] and a [ __ ] and like and like just or a [ __ ] or whatever and they like they just try to like say these really hard things about me because they want to make a reason for it to be okay they want to make a reason for me being touched when I was asleep to be justifiable in their minds because they know their friend [ __ ] up but they don't want instead of being like dude [ __ ] you to like the person who did it they're just finding reasons to hate me and make it okay that it happened to me in their own brain and whoever else's brain like oh well it's okay that that happened to her because she's a [ __ ] as a kid it happened to her because she tries to sleep with awesome streamers and I should even have to go and say this but I have not slept with a single Austin streamer in my life which is like insane that like there was such a rumor going around that that was the case so so what I what I'm just to kind of clarify so it sounds like you heard a rumor and you're trying to make sense of who would start this rumor and what they must be thinking yeah but if I'm hearing this and and if this is because I I'm just kind of noticing that there's like a lot of like low quality information floating around right like people like rumor Mills and this and that um but but I'm not I'm not hearing and and you're you feel very confident that you've been blacklisted yeah um I was like not super confident it was just speculation up until one of my friends at the time we were just having a good time and he just randomly said this I'm like what why didn't you tell me this before but he um he said to me uh oh yeah like I got a message from the person who uh touched me when we were streaming together saying that he was really triggered that I was hanging out with you and never to do that again and then I was like what the hell and then recently I ended up seeing those screenshots for the first time and it's like Jesus Christ and uh then after I came out about it um it was more of like like a wave of people being like yes I was told not to hang out with you yes here's a screenshot of me being told not to hang out with you like I just all the all of my like theories in my head after that one thing that was told to me confirmed came true and I just heard this wave of people saying like I was trying to hang out with you this this and this here's a screenshot and um it was just really sad that they never said anything before but now that it was like popular for me to speak my truth instead of to keep quiet about it it was easier to say I see so are you is your career as a streamer like is it GG you're how how do you see it now well I have like a nine to five right now but um I I'm not gonna give up on content creation because I love content creation and I'm not doing it for the numbers it was really awesome to be able to do it for a full-time job but I'm not doing it for the numbers I'm doing it because I love it you know and a lot of people come into my chat and this is something recent like I got a lot of viewers obviously when I was addressing the situation initially and then I went kind of back down and a lot of people have been like here's your view count good job trying to clout Farm [ __ ] and it's like bro like at the end of the day I love to stream and I loved my community like and I love making videos and YouTube videos it's like not something I'm just gonna give up you know it's not like I pay attention the numbers I don't do it for the numbers I'm not gonna sit here and run around and be like oh this many viewer Andy you should respect me like bruh like and it's crazy how many people like let the numbers get to their head like that but um what do you like about streaming I like being able to meet people from all over and I guess to make people laugh because I've always wanted to like kind of be based in comedy and stuff and um it's just fun like the people I met through streaming is really like kind of wholesome and like a lot of people like like being able to make those connections is really awesome like my best friend um she lived in Chicago before this and then I made her move down here with me so now we're like twin but like we like we like hang out and like have fun and stuff and um like a lot of people that I met through streaming like and my other friend moved here like a lot of people that I like really love and like care about moved here and I get to hang out with them and it's just nice and yeah but I've always loved video like videos my main passion I guess because I even went to film school because I was like well if I'm not gonna be a YouTuber I might as well edit movies or something so and do you feel like Adriana you're um how do you feel about our conversation today I feel like um I feel like anxious I guess like I feel like I'm glad like I I feel like we touched on a lot of topics so far they're really good um that I I didn't even realize but I also feel like anxious because I'm just waiting for someone to clip anything I said and be like well look at this so but I guess that's just something I need to get over because it's gonna happen further a while now all right hmm I was gonna say I find it I haven't I've been trying to steer clear of clippable stuff but I mean of course there's always something but if there's always going to be something but I mean you know it wasn't I've certainly done worse I'll say that okay uh what i is it okay if I just kind of share with you like what I heard from you about this conversation and and maybe like just add a couple of my own thoughts uh and then if there's anything that's I think we're having this conversation for kind of like important reasons with a capital I and so I just want to make sure that we kind of touched on everything that we needed to with sufficient depth because we still do have some time and if there's something like more that we need to dive into or talk about I'd love to do that so the first thing is that it sounds like you've had your own personal struggle with all of this experience around sexual assault around dealing with guilt dealing with shame dealing you know thinking about what you could have done differently once again a lot of that sort of almost like not holding other people responsible at the very beginning and really focusing on what you could have done which is very natural by the way um and there's actually like brain science that that explains why we do that and and so it sounds like you had sort of come to some degree of Peace but but then what I'm kind of really noticing or what I what I felt like I heard is that it felt to me like you got strapped into a roller coaster and then the roller coaster started moving and then you didn't really like you weren't Dr like there's no there's no wheel on a roller coaster it's not you know ain't no Mario Kart there's no steering wheel it's once you board so even like the initial disclosure that there was a sexual assault was like not your choice people are kind of entering your space and telling you how it's going to be you know I'm gonna try to do my best to give people kind of the benefit of the doubt and and and as you know I'm not hearing threats per se but more like hey you need to really think about what you're going to say and like how it could be perceived because like this is the world that we live in and there's a lot of Like You Know Drama farming and clout chasing and all this kind of stuff but I I'm really kind of just feeling like the conversation just got taken out of your hands and became particular things then people are weighing in and then you didn't want to like disappoint anyone right you didn't want to like get on anyone's Blacklist which you've managed to do anyway yeah and and trying to take the middle I just end up yeah and following yep and and I have some thoughts about that that I'll share in a second but and then I think that there's just a lot of like um and then once it kind of came out you know then there's all the victim blaming that goes on and and things like that I think that there's uh a lot of doubt um once again I want to sort of give people the benefit of the doubt there and and just acknowledge that sometimes when you discover that someone you care about or someone you believe is a good person uh has committed a sexual assault it can feel really unbelievable and so people are like vocally and in that moment kind of like processing their disbelief like with you you know and so I I think sometimes that can ha like I've seen that kind of thing happen and I kind of want to give people the benefit of the doubt I think that that's one end of the spectrum the other end of the spectrum is people will try to pick apart your story right and it's like if you were asleep how did you even know you know and and they'll they'll operate in a lot of different ways because they're having you know because they don't believe you or they don't believe their friend is capable of something like this and I think that also goes to you know we think about people as good people or bad people but I think most people think of themselves as good people and I think a lot of people will do bad things and they'll do it because they thought they were doing right um or that it was acceptable or whatever and and I think sometimes we forget that good people can commit sexual assaults what we think of is good people and yeah because most sorry to interrupt but most um sexual assaults are like people think like oh my gosh like it's you're gonna get pulled into an alanine and someone's just gonna like take advantage or you write then and there but it's like most sexual assaults are people that like you know like like it can be anybody like that you know it's a co-worker friend a teacher whatever like it's not usually well like there's a very low um like percentage of it that is just like Ally dark alley whatever but um a lot of it is mostly by people that the victim knows so yeah absolutely so I think about two-thirds of sexual assaults are are committed by people that know them and usually also not like not even necessarily like distant acquaintances but oftentimes friends family bosses employees co-workers like people that you may even know well um and so just kind of going back to like what I kind of heard you say is that as people started to express skepticism and and victim blame and stuff like that it kind of like brings up for you like all the shame and guilt and stuff that you have already dealt with yeah for sure and then what happens is people make you responsible for ruining someone's career it's not the act that they committed yeah and and I I've seen that in you know very closely as a clinician and even in terms of families like oh my God you're tearing this family apart if you say something like that it'll tear the family apart and it's like what I think what tore the family apart is sexual assault yeah and and then it sounds like there was you know there have been consequences for you very real consequences I'm also hearing that it's been a challenge for you from uh and now we're gonna I'm gonna kind of focus a little bit more on just things that I heard you say and just how you kind of approach stuff so I'm hearing that there's weak Adriana and weak Adriana doesn't weak Adriana feels things but also doesn't get stuff done because you can't feel things and get [ __ ] done at the same time right those are like you there's like strong Adriana who gets things done and weak Adriana who does not get things done yeah and even then I mean I think I mentioned something about you know I don't get the sense that anyone's like looking out for you in in a weird way like yourself included it sounds to me like you know oftentimes what can happen in people who have experienced traumas like they just learn early on that they're not worth it that you don't have value so like who cares about what you know you like people will just be taught that we don't care about what you want like oh like here's Adriana having a breakdown being hospitalized for psychiatric reasons and you're making it all about you and your attention seeking oh my God you're doing it for attention so I'm just trying to imagine if you're 14 years old or whatever and something like that happens like what do you think about how much you're worth what do you learn about how much you matter and I'm kind of hearing in a lot of ways you kind of don't even from your like because like even you're when you're talking about okay how do I navigate this roller coaster like how do I not piss people off how do I like censor what I say like how do I like temper my it and even then it's like okay well I'm doing this for others altruism which which is can be good and healthy and all that but you know I I hope for you Adriana that you're able to find a place where you can do something for yourself you know you can speak your truth because it's important to you yeah I mean this past time it was pretty important to me but it being like quiet for a while just reinforce those feelings like nobody cares you know like nobody cares about me and those feelings are really reinforced as like friends just started to drop and it's like like I express the feelings to my friends and private a lot and and I sometimes I feel like I would just talk about it too much because I would just be so hurt by it and when I it made me realize like when I did do it for me and when I did Express these feelings for me people didn't care either so I always told myself when I get bigger as a content creator I'm gonna come out about it for me but I ended up being granted an opportunity to talk about it without having to become a bigger Creator in the first place and um I'm very grateful for the opportunity but um it's you know I'm still facing repercussions regardless and I still would and I I had to realize that but it's it's better than like suffering and silence and and seeing that person continue to do things towards women you know because the main thing that just made me most uncomfortable was hearing that like he was also continuing that behavior towards multiple other women and that's when I really like just took it upon myself like this isn't for me anymore and you know I I feel good having my story being out but it's it's not really for me in the main reason I like the main thing I think about yeah I I think that that I think a lot of sexual assault victims have come forward and have made the world a better place because of that um I mean I feel like sorry to interrupt but I I feel like that really helped me realize like what was what happened to me was wrong in terms of like other incidents because um when the me too thing came out originally I think it was like 2017 um like with Hollywood and everything I was reading some of the stories and I was like wait what like this really like this is this isn't okay and it made me like I was able to process the fact that I got sexually assaulted when I was 14 I was able to process that at 17 and realized like yo that wasn't okay because for those years in between I'm just sitting there like telling myself like I really liked him you know like it's okay that he did that to me because you know I had a crush on him and um but even like after it initially happened like the minute after it happened all I wanted to do was throw up I was in like a State of Shock I didn't know why I'm like why do I feel this way like I like him you know and I was in a State of Shock I didn't know how to handle it and I was like on a camping trip with my family I was only 14 I didn't know what to do but um that's where I just started getting into like harmful things in order to like feel something I guess um and uh I didn't know how to deal with it and then after like I grew up a little bit and I I like had a relationship at 16. I wasn't able to connect like sexually like I wasn't able to figure that out in a healthy way you know like it didn't feel normal and it felt like by the time I was in a relationship with someone for nine months before we ever did anything and when I did it was just it was so hard and it was like a very like traumatizing experience even though like everything was consensual and everything was like chill it's like I didn't my body didn't react to it very well so it made me realize like why is this happening like is this normal like am I just gay like I had a feeling I was like bye at the time but I was like damn like am I just gay like I don't I don't understand like why is this happening I didn't understand until I was 17. like a year after um because then I ended up breaking up but I was 17 and I read the bottom of me two stories and I'm like and I like realized how other people processed it and I and I read a lot about it and I was like oh my God like this thing that happened when I was 14 like that wasn't okay it wasn't okay in all these years I just tried to make it seem okay but yeah I think on this most unfortunate things after traumatic experience is especially sexual lenses you know you feel not okay but you should feel okay and then what you end up doing is contorting yourself to like fit back into society right because like there's a part of you that's sort of like Twisted out of shape and then like you're like wait this is twisting out of shape it doesn't feel right on the inside but instead of like twisting it back into shape we twist the rest of us and then when we try to plug back in we don't fit yeah and then it causes all kinds of problems like you know romance sentiment relationships things like that and and the biggest problem is that we don't really know like and then since we've like Twisted out of shape and we don't fit then it becomes an us problem like it's my fault now that I I'm so [ __ ] up I can't you know connect with another human being like I should be able to do this like what's wrong with me when what really starts is that original problem and then we start to take ownership of the whole thing and the other thing I I really appreciate you sharing all of your perspectives and experiences because I think honestly Adriana this is not talked about enough so one of the most uh bizarre things is like you know we talk about sexual assault as if it's a uniformly traumatizing whereas honestly the most like Clinic is anecdotal experience but the most common reaction that I see from people is something that you said earlier which is it's whatever yeah and like people because don't realize that that is kind of like a very common reaction and then it's like people say like oh well you said it was whatever before and now you're saying something about it and it's like okay like I don't know like I don't know like the first twit longer obviously that happened I was ended up we ended up agreeing to say like I was obviously persuaded to say that it was harassment and not assault and it's crazy that everyone's like you change your story you change your story the story is still the same it's just there's more vocabulary words this time and because it's the same story I was touched my chest was touched like my chest region was touched it said that the first time sorry for not saying boob the first time because I guess I should have said boob the first time for people to take me seriously because the all the facts were there it just said oh well it's sexual harassment instead of assault or whatever um because I asked to put that in there but then it's like it's like running someone over in your car but then telling someone like oh I didn't run them over and it's like well I see right there that you did well I didn't oh then it must be true then it must what you're saying must be true because I literally said my chest was touched but then there's my little Cliff side note that was asked to be put in there this is assault or harassment not assault and then everyone's like oh well you did just tell us you got assaulted but you just said it to harassment of salt so we're just gonna take that and run with it it's like and now people like well you're changing your story it's like I'm really not like go read the first twit longer again I I'm just being more expressive of how it made me feel and saying boob instead of Chess this time because I guess that makes it more valid for people how what is it like when you when this comes out and you're talking about being harassed or assaulted and like the response that you get is like you didn't capitalize your first letter after a period me literally literally what's that what's invalidating because it makes me feel like like all this it's almost like like I'm being gaslit all over again from like whatever because I've obviously experienced that in my life it makes me feel like people are being like oh well it's really not that bad it's not that bad like you're exaggerating you're exaggerating and because I realized that I grew up that way it's like I almost feel like am I exaggerating and I need like people to be like Adriana you're not like you're not like this is awful that has happened to you like I'm so sorry it's happened to you like this is awful to like re remind me that you know I'm not you know I know it's gonna get clipped but I that my feelings are valid and that I'm allowed to feel uncomfortable I'm allowed to feel those feelings because I'm allowed to feel like my body wasn't mine when it was in that experience because I was asleep not able to consent and all of a sudden someone is taking advantage of that and why on Earth do you think that's what's going to get clipped what is going to get clipped that I was saying what was going to get clipped was saying that sometimes I feel like maybe the trolls are right and I feel like maybe it isn't that bad but then my friends have to remind me that it's bad because I already know that lsf comments is going to be like see why do her friends need to remind her that it's bad so this story is getting all out of place I already know like I feel I see them in my brain I see the comments that I'm gonna get for saying literally anything like this guy is blue or whatever I just see the way people are gonna spin it um so I guess it's anxiety that I'm feeling but yeah sorry this side track but I just it is really anxiety what are you apologizing for again rambling I guess and is that okay yeah but see now it's tricky because now I'm telling you oh Adriana you're apologizing bad apologizer and then you're like okay yeah okay right so so you I I think it's okay doesn't bother me but yeah I you know I and and the reason I pointed out to you is because I I think it I mean I know that the internet is a judgmental place and sometimes I think it's like very easy to forget when people like change their stories and they didn't always well yeah like that's what happens it's like okay you're posting on Reddit should you spend less time on Reddit yeah I should well then why don't you your story is inconsistent what are you doing posting on Reddit you should spend like you know like that's just how human beings are and I think sometimes we forget that that human beings remember things differently that memory is not perfect that as we numb ourselves and bury our feelings that as that process reverses over time that it's like okay to speak up a year later two years later five years later um it's also common for stories and perceptions to change that doesn't necessarily mean they're not true that's just how human memory is and you know yeah I'm just I I'm noticing how much RAM how much your RAM is occupied it feels to me like you can't even have a free conversation because in your own head you're like you've got your own little Board Room up there that's making suggestions to what you say it just it's really hard because it sounds exhausting I even I do it in my like private conversations too because at this point it's like who do you trust you know and who's gonna who's out to get you and who's not and like who actually like cares for you and like actually cares because I realized the first time these people who told me they actually cared didn't so since I realized that months later now it just makes you feel more anxious because it's like yeah these people are being nice to me now because it's the popular thing to do but what happens if it's not the popular thing to do anymore what happens if it blows over like it did last time because last time when I first came out things people were like I'm so sorry this happened to you those same people went to go comment on that person who did that to me's tweet happy birthday and it's like damn like you already forgot like it just it's just like a a couple weeks and all of a sudden it's okay like like you're the one who's sitting here commenting on my thing like I'm so sorry this happened to you I'm here for you then you're you're over here interacting with this said person that you claimed yourself was so bad like it's so now when people I have conversations with people I don't really know who to trust that sounds very isolated close yeah I have I have a couple close people that I do trust thank God but um it's hard when people come up to me like hey I'm so sorry whatever like I have to really be careful what I say because it's like oh if I say anything man Adriana your life is hard oh my God I guess sounds tough but but yeah so I don't know I don't I like almost feel uncomfortable like saying that my life is hard you know yeah that's why I'm saying it yeah because it's like whenever I think that it's like okay well I have to be grateful for everything I do have like I am grateful that I am like I'm able to be a streamer and stuff are you allowed to be ungrateful for the things that aren't great I don't know because then I'm being ungrateful and I don't I am grateful so I don't want to be ungrateful or seem ungrateful because I am is it possible to be both grateful and ungrateful at the same time sorry my bad no yeah I guess it is but I just don't know I feel like maybe they contradict each other I think it certainly feels that way so this is also something that we see a lot um when people are suffering usually like after a traumatic experience is that the world becomes black and white and like we're not allowed to be it's either or right there's manic kickass Adriana who is able to advocate for herself like you kind of suggested you can only do it when you're feeling the four M's right yeah and it's the four ends because it's the emo of the fish mmm and then it's like the fish and I love that emo so that's why I made that mantra for myself I'm gonna have to check out that emote later I wonder if people are it's the opposite of pogfish that people are doing the part it's like the fish it's not probably it's going like this Okay so um yeah I mean I I hope you can feel ungrateful too I mean I do obviously when I'm in my sad trenches I'm like [ __ ] like this is so sad like here's some of my feelings that I feel when I'm in my trenches I guess like the low lows it's like I feel it's like I I feel like oh I am a woman and in this male dominated space I'm not taken seriously and throughout my life I've just been used and I'm not seen as a person I'm seen as an object or something pretty to look at and this is just who I am and if I want to prove a point I have to do something very irrational and crazy in order to prove a point no matter what the consequence means to me or my loved ones and that's the thought these are thoughts that Circle my mind every time I have one of these deep breakdowns because it's like it's almost like I want to do this irrational thing for other people you know like I I because I don't want anybody else to go through this like I wouldn't wish this upon my worst enemy and so and it's hard because see I don't know what it's like what is it like to go through something that you wouldn't wish on your worst enemy it's hard and I like it sucks because the people who have gone through it they understand and it makes me really sad because I know when people understand that they've gone through it too but people there's people who can not have gone through it and try to understand but you can tell the way people have hate or the way people say these awful things to me you can tell they've never gone through it and I don't wish for them to go through it and it hurts it almost hurts more when I see people say they understand and they share their feelings too because it hurts knowing that they gonna do it too and it just sucks because it's so normalized and it's so common so many people have gone through it and it just sucks because it's like that shouldn't be a thing that's like saying like like I got shot in my leg and it hurt and I couldn't walk and and I couldn't do the things I loved whatever it happens when you get shot in the real leg you don't expect 50 other people to come out and be like I got shot in the lake too like it's such a weird thing that you think like like people don't be getting shot in the leg on a normal basis but then you come out and say oh I got shot in the leg I just didn't tell anybody because I didn't want to like seem like an attention [ __ ] I didn't want people to send me gift baskets and Edible Arrangements so I didn't tell people I was in the hospital for getting shot in the leg and then when people come out like I was shot in the leg and did the same thing too it's like what getting shot in the leg is like really common like I didn't realize it was so common because I didn't want to say anything about it and obviously they didn't either so I don't know yeah Adriana I really enjoy listening to you talk I mean like I enjoy may not be the right word but it's not like fun like I'm not gonna like yeah you know I know what I mean hey let's everybody get together on Friday night and watch this interview but yeah but I think there's something just really I've never heard anyone say it like this but man it's it's so just lies that when you talk about this and someone else shares with you that they understand and like you know who understands and who doesn't and that's really sad because like you know like in order to understand what I've gone through like you have had to walk a dark Road and you kind of see that and and so there's there's some degree of you know connection but like it's such a devastating thing to connect over I know and it's it's sad because what hurt me the most is like expressing my story to my family and I thought there'd just be like okay like I'm really sorry that happened but the way they reacted they didn't even have to tell me anything I just knew and it was really hard knowing like they didn't even tell me anything but the way they reacted it just it's really hard because I saw that they went through it too and I don't know it's just it's hard but I don't know how to ever make people understand because there's always going to be people who want to fight it and there's always going to be people who are going to defend the people who do these things and maybe it's because they really care about that person or maybe it's because they see that themselves in that person and maybe they feel guilty themselves so it's really disheartening you know what makes me both a little bit happy and a little bit sad I'm gonna tear up now too because you know I've been holding it back for a little while but it's okay to have feelings is you you say I don't know how to make people understand and yet I think what you've done today is help people understand I hope so I hope everything came across clear because sometimes I have all these things I want to say and I don't know how to say them but I think that's normal but a lot of times when I go into like speech mode I kind of don't like I like to be honest I probably get off the interview and be like I don't even remember what I said and then I'll like watch it back and be like okay don't watch it for a week I won't you're gonna be thinking all the wrong things if you watch it right afterwards one thing I I'd like to leave you with Adriana is is um there's some things that I have trouble letting slide and one of them is that there's no point in trying because it's so busted which I know you recognize is not entirely true but one thing that when I've worked with people who have managed to heal a fair amount I think one thing that changes is right now you've got all the dark feelings in the dark place and then there are times where you're feeling really really good about yourself where like you can come first but what I kind of hear when you say things like that is that there's like a normal Adriana who doesn't have either of those and yeah and what I what I hope you'll be able to find at some point in your life and and certainly more therapy can help with that it sounds like you've had some already but but also like healthy relationships and things like that it's not just therapy is to recognize that like who you are right now like are you are you in a high are you in a low right now like which where are you or neither I'm kind of like throughout the interview I was like teetering like oh but then I was like no and then I just kind of like compartmentalize it into like this is time for me to speak and be clear on what I have to say so I'm just kind of like like I was like teetering into like oh I'm getting emotional and I was like no I need to say these things because it's important I guess that's what my brain is saying to me like always you need to say these things this is important yeah and so and I I think what what happens sometimes is we like it's like there's so much flooding in our house that we pile up all the water on the side of the like and we build a dam and we block it all off yeah but the problem is the more that you Dam it up the second you open the gates it all comes rushing out and and for people you know I I do believe that you can heal from this like in a really like solid way in the sense that you can be happy and have a healthy relationship and have friends and I I really do believe that's possible for you I'm not just saying that because I'm like optimistic I've seen it happen before time and time and time again even today I think you've demonstrated to me at least like I hate this work how strong human beings can be yeah but I I would say that what I would encourage you to consider moving towards is a place where like the regular you can feel all of those things which I know sounds kind of foreign but that you don't have to be at a high high to feel good about yourself and prioritize yourself that you even don't have to be at a low low to feel ungrateful right that you can be kind of like a neutral you on a regular day you can have a cup of coffee in the morning and be like man there's a poor portion of my life that was absolute [ __ ] and then go about your day the word the thing about yeah I get you like that I'd be able to feel that feeling and then because sometimes like what I do is when I'm feeling okay is I'll joke about it and be like oh my gosh yeah so that's that's it's dumb like like obviously this was like a really impactful thing that really hurt me but like I'll be like my friend will be like falling asleep at a party or something like he'll be like just like it was like a guy he was like this like kind of fall asleep about a chair and I'm like don't fall asleep at a party don't fall asleep this is the worst mistake I've made in my life and everybody's like laughing like like my friends are laughing everyone else is like what the [ __ ] is she talking about why is she yelling I'm like don't fall asleep don't do it and um like you know I just joke about it because it's like when I'm in that good mood I'm not gonna like yes I like I'm aware that it happened to me but I just kind of like pass it off with comedy I mean I think honestly I think that's a step in the right direction which is you know not to make fun of sexual assault but but for you to be able to acknowledge a part of your life not push it away not numb it up and still like continue living right and and you know I I hope you're able to find that one day where you can just live like a normal life instead of have these parts of your life that are just completely separate and then threaten to overwhelm you yeah I hope so let me see if I made sure I said everything but because as I said I wrote this when I was in my low so I was able to think more clearly as in terms of my feelings um yeah I guess I said everything let's go look at that that's kind of yeah I did say everything that I was feeling so that's good is there anything a row I guess how do you feel about saying everything that you wanted to say I feel good because I know that I said what I wanted to say and I'm not gonna like be like oh [ __ ] I should have said that well maybe maybe I still will but in terms of like now like it's not like not like oh I forgot to say this because I made sure I said everything that I wrote previously I I just saw something that gave me a tiny glimmer of hope you were reading over your notebook which I imagine is filled with some dark stuff and yet you had this like very lovely half smile and yeah and I got some sense like I couldn't quite tell 100 but I almost got some sense of like peace in that smile yeah like I'm glad that I kind of covered everything yeah so I I very much appreciate everything that you covered I appreciate you for giving me the opportunity to talk about it well I shall take that appreciation I shall up the ante and appreciate you even more for you know really at asking to have the conversation which is hard to do because I feel like it's really respectable to talk about my feelings in this environment where that's what we're focused on right there's no drama trying to farm whatever like like this we're focused on feelings and how it makes me feel and whatever whereas when I try to talk about these things on my stream it's kind of like invalidated by people because like oh she's trying to get her numbers up or oh look at she's doing this as I said lsf comments they just generated my head sure but at this point because it's so almost predictable but um yeah so I'm glad I was able to have this opportunity yeah I me too I I think I learned a little bit more about the experience that people have I I think that you know there's so many things that we don't realize in terms of like what our reactions could be which is it's whatever to what victim blaming looks like how people feel what to expect because I think that's the whole thing is like no one knows what to expect so like people don't even know that this is happening they don't know what's that it's okay not okay you know and and so I think it's yeah and I feel like I just remember this sorry to interrupt but in terms of like like understanding it I guess and the feelings the people I realized like they did not I would tell me a story or anything there's a lot of people I realize went through it but there's also people I realize cared for somebody who went through it too and they don't even have to tell me that I just you just know understand especially with the way this whole thing happened and it really um makes me like feel appreciated and like cared about I guess when people want like when people listen to me I guess and understand I'm happy you've been able to find at least a few of those people yeah sorry that was kind of also I feel like that wasn't a well-structured sentence but you know what I mean I do know what you mean I think that's because you're actually a very good speaker thank you I hear it a lot but I I don't believe it I know I I believe it when I listen to myself but when I'm in the moment speaking I'm like wait a minute did I say that right yeah well thank you very much Adriana any last kind of thoughts or questions before we wrap up um unless I just did a quick question are we not drama farming here is that not what we're doing because that's what I've been trying to do this whole time is it oh yeah that's what a lot of people claim anything I do is me playing fortnite oh my God you're drama farming fortnite playing like bro I'm playing fortnite like I just want to go to Tilted Towers cool but well take care and enjoy the rest of your day as as best as you can and thank you very much for speaking thank you for listening adios you know just to kind of close this today out I think it's if you all take one thing away from the interview I think a really important thing to take away is that the experiences after a sexual assault can be in a lot of ways like even more damaging than the actual assault itself and I think that's something that we really really lack an understanding of oftentimes it's the Fallout after the assault that causes at least in my opinion in in a handful of cases that I've worked with like even more problems right so it's one thing to be let's say sexually assaulted by a family member it's another thing entirely to like have your family tell you to keep quiet about it and when I've worked with people in the past I almost think that that second thing is what's so much more damaging it's the sense of betrayal abandonment you know friends kind of like not being there like that's what hurts so much more and I I think this is why we need to have conversations about sexual assault because you know like we talk about house we talk about sexual assault being bad but we don't talk about how it's bad people don't realize what to expect what they go through sometimes we don't even realize what constitutes assault we don't realize how this act will have Ripple effects in our life and so then when we do have difficulties forming relationships breaking down at particular points as a society we don't know how to be like trauma sensitive or trauma-informed in terms of helping or supporting those people so even in places like the workplace and so then what ends up happening is like we think about this individual event and then sometimes their thoughts of oh it wasn't that bad it wasn't like you were XYZ you were only ABC what are you complaining about and so there's all kinds of stuff about the experience of going through this and how it affects you how it affects your thoughts how people react to it there's a very like real life component that exists outside the ACT and this is the thing that is the most misunderstood about sexual trauma everyone's focused on the the Trump the traumatic event traumatic event traumatic event itself and if it happened five years ago like why are you complaining now right but that's the whole point is that it lingers and manifests in ways that we don't originally realize and that's what we need to have a greater awareness and understanding of because what I tend to see is that you know Adriana did a great job of sort of sharing with her like the guilt and shame and then she kind of like overcomes that right and then like people are like victim blaming and so there comes the guilt and shame all over again oh like you could ruin someone's career like do you want that to happen do you want to ruin this person's career and and so when when people make statements like that like it brings back all the guilt right no I don't want to ruin anyone's career like that's a bad thing and I want to be a good person and so I think that there's just a lot of you know misunderstanding misunderstood I'm not even misunderstanding I think there's just a lack of understanding that we you know we hyper focus on particular things and don't really like acknowledge what the full spectrum of the impact is and so I really appreciate Adriana you know coming forward and sharing this perspective I I hope for those of you all that watched it first of all thank you very much to everyone who is respectful and compassionate you know a couple of other things to just toss out there so I noticed she didn't name any names and we're not really interested in encouraging her to do that that's not what we're here for we're not here to be judge jury or executioner it's not our job to judge and say that someone did something right or someone did something wrong we are not here to determine guilt or innocence that's not what our job is and we're not accusing or attacking or trying to create drama or whatever like that's really not why we're here I imagine that if you're caught up in this stuff and you're aware that this is going on and you're watching this that you may feel bad about it or feel attacked or whatever which is like I think it's a completely understandable reaction right and also it's like that's not why we're here we're not here to try to make anyone look bad what we're trying to hear to try to do is support and educate people who are going through this and it's like it's not our job to pass a judgment or to call you a good person or a bad person that that's not really what we're here for but I think that in what I kind of heard from Adriana and I don't I don't really know right so there's like different perspectives on this as well so and we're not we're not interested in determining truth today that's not we're never determiners of Truth right we're here to help people understand themselves and help people understand a little bit about how to navigate this absolute mess of a thing that we call life that's our goal and there are all kinds of like other things involving sexual assault that we did not even touch on today which are absolutely what worth exploring right so this is a case of a woman who was sexually assaulted and is part of a prominent content creator or community what about people who are not part of prominent content creator communities what is the Fallout aftermath or drama look like for people who are not involved in content creation that's a completely different ball game what does sexual assault look like in the workplace completely different ball game what does sexual assault look like if you're a man completely different ballgame what does it look like when you were falsely accused of sexual assault completely different ballgame and so there's a lot about these conversations that that we I mean there's a lot about this topic that we still need to explore that people still need to understand and you know I think this is hopefully the first conversation but I I don't know like this is like what I think is missing on the Internet is like people just don't like there's there's not a human representation of it because what I see time and time and time again I I want to say that honestly upwards of 90 if not 95 or damn near close to 100 percent of people I've worked with who have had who've been sexually assault not even worked with just people that I've met if I have a conversation with them almost every single one or every one that I can think of In This Moment did not realize what was happening at some point during the process they did not even realize that this is this constitutes sexual assault and and a couple of the reactions that Adriana shared I think are very common which is that since we sort of view it as this bad thing everyone assumes that the reaction I should have is bad but sometimes people will like I I mean I've heard this a dozen times at least where people will say like I'm confused why my body is reacting this way I love this person or this person cares about me and this person loves me so far too common experience so it's almost like what our society is missing is like an understanding of what it looks like and what it feels like to go through a situation like this and that's really what we're trying to address today I hope it helps I I mean I I really think it does and I I do think honestly that there were a lot of good clippable moments but not clippable in the sense of like oh lulls foreign she used the s word and the W word but I I wanted to use the language that she uses but I can't say those things so even I'm playing that game but I I do really think that there's just a lot of you know like distilled experience in in what Adriana shared today and I I hope it's educational for y'all at the least and ideally it'll be helpful so thank you all very much for being respectful being compassionate giving us even showing up because the fact that y'all are here means that let's see you know there's like 2500 people who hopefully know a little bit more about what apparently is a far too common experience so thank you all for coming
