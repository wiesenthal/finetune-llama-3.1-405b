it's sort of like you can't learn the right way to feel because no matter what happens you're being given the same feedback so your your mind has not learned how to sort of differentiate between like pride and shame yeah the topic is really just uh what i want to improve on what do i want to approve on welcome friend thank you and what do you go by uh i go by josh underscore ow on discord but i mainly just go by josh okay so josh what do you want to improve on well i want to improve on feeling proud of myself because whenever i work hard and do everything i can to work towards something and succeed i just i don't feel proud of myself or my accomplishments or the effort that i even put in to getting the end result and so i thought that i thought that maybe i would someday just like wake up and feel happy and just ecstatic incredible about knowing that i put in so much work and effort to accomplish something that mattered but it just doesn't end up that way whether i succeed or fail and it just kind of feels empty wow that sounds tough dude so let me just make sure i'm hearing you correctly so it sounds like you do put in effort you work hard and you don't always succeed but sometimes you succeed yeah and you're trying to figure out um and so help me understand what how do you feel about yourself when you do succeed well well i guess uh i don't know maybe whenever i succeed because i like i actually managed to go out for runs and exercises sometimes and even do my homework because i'm in college and all that but even when i succeed and do all that i guess i just kind of feel maybe maybe it's more so content i'm just like okay well i guess i got that done that that's good now i just don't have to like stress about the rest of my day knowing that i did something i guess that was productive i don't really feel ecstatic about it i see just kind of so what i'm hearing is that you you kind of feel real maybe relieved like you don't have to worry about that anymore but you don't feel any sense of pride yeah do you think what you've accomplished is noteworthy i think i think it's it has been noteworthy yeah because i mean it's like i like i'm i'm regularly working out right and i even go out for runs often and and that just has actually been kind of enjoyable to do just the process and it feels like i don't know i feel less stressed out during my days as a result and then i'm able to have better control over doing the things that i know it need to do but it just kind of um i don't know it just doesn't feel like a big giant hallmark like i sometimes wish it would as in oh yeah now i'm moving forward in my life now i'm doing it i'm on the grind it just doesn't feel maybe euphoric or as or as amazing as i thought it'd be yeah so i'm i'm almost hearing that when you i i okay let me make a couple of assumptions here josh and you let me know if these are accurate so the first is that prior to working out consistently consistently you sort of had this idea that if you started working out consistently you would like feel really good about yourself you're like yeah i'm doing it yeah and now that you're doing it you don't really feel the pride that you were expecting no no do you feel proud about anything that's i've been i've been thinking about that question a little bit but i wonder if i ever felt any sort of pride in my life at all i mean i don't know if it's anything like pride but when it any whenever that comes to mind all i can think about or the times where i was part of something that i had to do with a whole group of people that i had to get to know like there was a time when i was in baseball and i was in junior leagues for that and i just felt so i guess i felt so alive whenever i was just with my teammates and i got to bond with them and practice with them and do scrimmages and that just felt really it just felt really invigorating like that was just a part of my life that i've been missing all along was like camaraderie but i guess i felt pride maybe i did feel pride more so just in what i was able to accomplish um in terms of what my team accomplished but not me because it wasn't about me i just felt pride i guess maybe towards my team and the things that we were able to do and how far we were able to go things like that okay so i'm i'm hearing that the only thing that you were able to take pride in was something that was a team effort and even when you talk about the team effort you almost purposely exclude yourself as a contributor yeah and and the only time that i ever considered being a big part of that whole process was when they directly actually because we had a championship game like at the very end of our of our league and we ended up losing it like horrifically we just got absolutely destroyed but then we had a party or get together afterwards to celebrate how far we came and they gave me a whole trophy for for just um for how much i meant to them how much i'm into the team and it's called the heart award right it's like a whole acronym about like having heart endurance attitude respect and team and i just and they gave it to me last out of everyone else's trophies and i remember that because i was like man i i feel so appreciated you know because they because my efforts my attitude actually meant something you know and it made a positive impact in their lives and they they really that was the heart and soul of the team and knowing that like i never felt that way during the season but it was only at that moment afterwards when they gave me that word that i just i felt like i was just really really happy i was just it just felt amazing wow how are you feeling sharing this story i mean i'm just recalling like that moment i mean i just feel i don't know i just feel like it just feels like bliss or happiness because then it just calls back to all the all the highs and lows that we've been through together and the things that we've done and just what we said and did and just what we went through and just how that all culminated into that moment where i got that trophy it felt like it was worth it it felt like that i that it was deserved or earned and that just felt like that was the proper ending to an amazing story i guess sounds boss dude sounds good absolute boss so let me ask you something when um josh can you tell me a little bit about your upbringing yeah of course so generally the way i understand it now is i was kind of brought up as a and treated as sort of a special or gifted kid right so it was i just grew up with me my mom my biological parents foursome and then and one older brother and i i've always just been kind of a like an introverted kind of shy but kind of kind kid you know and then i grew up as the years went on my parents and teachers and other older adults or peers of mine would be like man josh you're just such a such a kind and smart kid like you're gonna be able to do great things man and then and then that just kept going on and on for years until especially i got in like junior high or high school when it felt like it was more of an insidious thing to me because i felt like my parents and all the other peers and adults that around me telling me these great things it just felt like i had to be the chosen one right i felt like i was like anakin skywalker okay and i had to be the one to be able to save the world and bring balance and just do all these great things because i was just so great unlike anyone else like the avatar and i just it felt like i had to just be that guy and whenever i faced struggles and was human and failed and fell fly on my face it just those times just absolutely decimated me mentally because i felt like i had to keep i had to keep people um to believe keep people believing that i was the guy that i was the chosen one and then when i wasn't i i failed then i was just who was i at that point i'm just some loser going through high school don't know what they're doing with their life okay so and then it just it sounds like you've been carrying around a lot of expectation yeah now so when you did well what did your mom parents say teachers say like let's say like you're eight years old and you get an a on a test how do they respond i mean pretty much the same way they're like oh wow josh like you made an a on the test like man you're so freaking good at like math or whatever like you're just like i'm so proud of you i love you man and i'm like thanks and i guess how would you feel i would just be like oh um yeah i i guess i got 100 on it like i guess it's something yeah whatever okay so okay um can i think for a second josh yeah good do you know how to feel pride i'm pretty sure i don't how do you understand that probably because i know i never had an experience where i personally within my being feel and recognize what pride is even like especially myself i just it's just kind of like a foreign entity to me i guess yeah so let's let's try to understand this okay so here's so let's start with this idea of being gifted so what i'm kind of noticing is that like let's say getting a hundred on a test is something that many people would be proud of whereas what i'm noticing is that like because you were kind of gifted there was an expectation that you would do well so even if you get 100 on the test that's not something to be proud of that's like baseline does that make sense yeah so it's like it kind of like is tricky because if we expect you to get a hundred the most you can do is meet expectations sometimes you're going to fall short of expectations but you can't really exceed expectations and when we really think about like what are we proud of we're not proud of doing average we're proud of doing exceptional but if your expectations are so high how can you ever be exceptional yeah does that can i i would like to add i would like to add something um tidbit that i think is really important as well you know mine whenever that complex became more of a thing whenever i was growing up in high school and junior high like even when i would fail like my parents especially would be like well yeah no worries man like you fail you you can try again and you can do better and even whenever they gave me that kind of feedback it just kind of was too late and it's cemented in my mind where i thought to myself i put it on myself where i was like no i need to be better like i need to be a chosen gifted one right even if everyone else says so i don't i don't think so how did you feel like how did you feel when they said that i i don't know i just maybe it depended on the situation but either i was kind of like yeah i guess i failed it's whatever or i was just absolutely devastated and i beat myself up and when your power said it's okay you can try again later how did that make you feel just made me feel like an absolute like a failure like i just so it's kind of interesting because because your parents are saying things that should be encouraging but what effect does it have on you not a positive one yeah like how do you understand that like so okay your kid does poorly right so you're a parent and you say it's okay you can try again how do you understand like how does that make a child feel worse you know that's a good question i i'm not really sure i even have the answer to that is that how you felt well yeah it was okay yeah so i think it's kind of weird so josh i think there's i think we can sort of sort this out first of all um sorry i i don't mean to laugh because your situation is serious but i i think that there's like a couple of interesting things going on and i think a lot of it has to do with expectation so oftentimes as gifted kids when you grow up like you're given all these expectations right and you internalize these expectations like i'm supposed to do really well and it's kind of weird but oddly enough your parents were dismissive of your shame does that make sense yeah does that feel accurate to you um i think so yeah because they never really yeah right so so i know it sounds kind of weird because when we think about parents we think about like oh like this isn't dismissing shame a bad thing i mean i mean isn't it a good thing like don't we like not want like if our kid does poorly like don't i want to encourage him and like help him not feel shame anymore so the interesting thing there is i i'm sort of noticing that like in your upbringing you were kind of like not allowed the range of success right so even when you failed they sort of dismissed that and then like even when you succeeded that was sort of expected so i'm sort of noticing that i almost think about shame and pride as two sides of the same coin like in order to be ashamed of something like you know you can be proud of the same things that you could be ashamed of if you did well like you can maybe be proud of that if you did poorly like you can feel ashamed of that does that make sense yeah they're like kind of like the same like on the same spectrum but just at opposite ends of the spectrum like shame and pride with me so the really interesting thing here is that i i think it's it's kind of interesting that they dismissed your shame and they they tried to like help you feel better about yourself but somewhere along the way i think they just sort of like started communicating on a level that you were just not on like i don't mean that they were above you or below you i just mean that y'all were like operating on different wavelengths in terms of like achievement and lack of achievement does that make sense yeah and i imagine it's actually quite confusing for a child to grow up in that situation so like let me just put it to you this way like if i do poorly on a test and my parents are like it's okay there's no problem with that you should do you'll be fine because you're so smart it's kind of weird because what they're telling me doesn't actually mirror like reality right like if i did poorly like they're not saying hey you did poorly you know you should really like think about trying better next time or like let's think about what you could have done better does that make sense like they're not saying that they're sort of like like even when you do poorly they're not like validating the fact that you did poorly is that fair yeah i mean it's just kind of swept to the wayside exactly right and then even in in periods of time when you could be when you should be proud proud right and your parents are like they're giving you positive feedback but like the thing is you have high expectations on yourself and also the feedback they give you when you're doing well and the feedback they give you when you're doing poorly actually seems kind of the same does that make sense yeah pretty much right and and so like i i don't know if this is kind of if if i'm making sense here but it's sort of weird because like as a child if they're saying oh you're so smart everything will be fine when you do well and oh you're so smart everything will be fine when you do poorly it's like how does that child learn what to be proud of and what to be ashamed of does that make sense yeah it's just just confusing you get the same thing either way exactly right it's confusing like you like you're getting the same thing everywhere and so what i think may have actually happened is like i don't know that you were like you know how to feel proud i mean you do when we'll get there in a second but the first thing that i want to share with you is i i don't think that this is like it's sort of like you can't learn the right way to feel because no matter what happens you're being given the same feedback so your your mind has not learned how to sort of differentiate between like pride and shame does that i mean i i i hear that you know how to feel shame and you know how to feel pride so like but is this sort of resonating with you or you think i'm kind of like in the wrong ballpark i i think that's actually pretty accurate so what i'm sort of hearing from you is that like you don't know how to feel pride and i know it sounds kind of weird because normally we're actually like taught how to feel pride and the key thing about how to feel proud is like even if i'm going to kind of give you an example which is like let's say that i'm an overly optimistic protective parent like i'm a helicopter parent who thinks that my child is is jesus christ reincarnated plus with the the spirituality of jesus jesus christ with the mind of stephen hawking and the physical form of let's say michael phelps okay if you know who those people are right so it's like i have the uber child the most amazing child in the world and i am constantly telling that child you're amazing you're amazing you're perfect you're perfect you're amazing everyone you're just the best thing ever how how do you think that child feels about themselves i mean they'd be like uh yeah that's just my bottom line like yeah that's yeah i guess i'm just amazing right so like like they're gonna grow up sort of feeling amazing about themselves but if you really like think about those kids they actually have like very they're like very insecure right i don't know if you've known kids like this but like kids who are grown up grow up in a situation where their parents are like overly overly overly supportive they're like very easily threatened and like become insecure very easily oftentimes they'll grow up as bullies i don't know if you've had like any is it does this kind of make it have you known people like that maybe you are someone like that but and it's sort of like the just providing overwhelming positive feedback without any kind of like negative correction does not raise like a healthy amount of pride and self-confidence in a child it raises things like arrogance and underneath the arrogance is insecurity like my point here is that when children aren't given both sides of the coin and i think that's what sort of happened with you you sort of like i don't get the sense that you even know what to be proud of because you have like such high expectations of yourself and like people haven't oddly enough even validated when you did poorly and this sort of results in something that's kind of interesting which is why do you think you felt so much pride by getting the heart trophy because whenever i was with that team and it was it's a whole sport where you have to rely on your teammates you can't just do everything yourself and then whenever an outside party like that people you get to know and trust just openly just accept you for who you are and then reward you for that then it just it just felt amazing because i was accepted and they know that i failed as well because we all did like we were all there together and no matter what like we still stuck together as a team and that couldn't be said i even remember that can be said for most teams that were in that same league at the time like even my best friend's like mom who was uh my best friend was also in baseball at the time doing the same thing like even his team apparently didn't have that kind of like bond or synergy yeah that my team had so i think there are a couple of other important elements there right so one is as you mentioned the acceptance the acceptance despite the failure so this is kind of interesting because it let that kind of sidesteps expectation does that make sense like because your mind has come to accept i mean expect particular things and so when you get praised for something and the other thing is like you haven't been praised your entire life for being the heart and soul of other people you've been praised for being gifted and so like what is it like to get praise in an area where you didn't think that's something you were capable of does that make sense nope yeah so because i what i'm noticing is that what really feels very like what you take can take pride in is actually things that were free from your expectations it's when other human beings saw value in you in a way that you did not expect value from yourself no definitely so do you have any thoughts about how to approach this you know and i have to preface i really do love healthy gamer and and i've watched so many other vods and streams it's a wonderful place but what would come to mind for me i don't know is just somehow free myself from that from those kinds of expectations but i don't really know how to apply something like that to my situation it just makes perfect sense i think it's challenging i think you've got the right answer but and we're going to help you with the how okay so the first thing is that as you mentioned so i think a lot of this has to do with expectations because the problem is the expectations you put on yourself make it so that you've got two options you can you know where perfection is the bare minimum right which is like how can you ever feel proud if you're if perfection gets you sort of a bare minimum pat on the back and then you can also fall short so there are a couple of different things i think what we can try to do is rectify a lot of like what you've missed out on so interestingly enough the first thing that we could try to do is have a place that validates your shame i know it sounds kind of weird right so like practically talking to finding some kind of friend or i don't know if you're in mental health treatment or you're working with a coach or whatever but like i think i know it sounds kind of weird but like i think one thing that's missing here is that if we kind of assume that this is like your brain doesn't really know what pride feels like i think a key part of that is in helping validate actually when you do poorly the interesting thing is that when we validate okay josh you didn't do a great job here and you really could do better and i want you to work like extra hard if you're willing to and then like give it another shot if someone said that to you and you actually gave it another shot and you succeeded how do you think you would feel about yourself i i think i may actually feel more proud of myself 100 right and why is that because they knew what i went through and failures that i had to experience in order to eventually try again and then succeed absolutely right because then your effort means something like before when they're like oh you'll get it like no big deal oh it's fine you got this easy easy clap and then it's like even if you work your ass off it's like they expected it to be easy for you so there's no acknowledgement of your effort and so like if there's no acknowledgement of your effort if no one else recognizes the effort that you're putting in you're putting in all this effort and everyone else is like by the way this should be easy bro because you're so gifted then when you succeed it's like what am i supposed to it took it was so hard for me to accomplish what everyone else is saying is easy how on earth am i supposed to take pride in this tell me i can't absolutely you work out every day or you work out a lot consistently you said you go running is this an achievement this is kind of like like that cool is it hard for you to do that well yeah just force myself to get out and do something instead of like playing games or whatever like it's not an easy thing to do okay so like that's what i want you to focus on right so i know it sounds kind of weird but validate you can start by validating how hard some of these things are for you you can validate how a year ago or two years ago like you know you weren't doing this every day so that's number one second thing is if you want to let go of expectations i think especially if you can do this in the community i think you've got to open yourself up to feedback in dimensions that you're not gifted now this can be a little bit tricky but like i don't know like i think heart and soul is beautiful because it's like the kind of thing that you didn't expect from yourself right so one thing is you can let go of your expectations we'll get to that in a second or what you can do is start operating in in your area in areas where your expectations don't apply does that make sense yeah so like that's a little bit tricky like what is that and that's where i'd say like if you've been if you're viewing yourself as a gifted kid then i would i really do stuff that's like a little bit more like volunteer oriented or charitable because i think those are the kinds of places where i'm not hearing that someone said that you know you you are an amazing human being all the time and all this kind of stuff so i'd say that like you don't have to let go of your expectations you can just operate in places outside of them and we already have evidence of that right so we know that when there's a community endeavor where people can value you like in a way that you don't necessarily value yourself that's what's going to make you feel proud does that make sense yeah because they're not they wouldn't be expecting that from me or and more importantly you're not expecting it from you yeah right that too so so like operate in places that are free from expectations so i'd say very very concretely if it's community oriented i think that's ideal if you're it sounds like you're in college so like i think if you want to do some volunteer work or something like that like go work at a homeless shelter go work at an animal shelter like go and do something where you're just trying to make the world a better place like you're just gonna go and try to like help people that you care about and i think that would actually hopefully help but that's kind of tricky because you have to like don't go in with too much expectation does that make sense yeah so you gotta you gotta be a little bit careful and then the last thing in terms of letting go of expectation i think that's where you really have to like probably do some more deeper work so i'd say like start with number one and number two which is pretty easy which is like first of all have people validate your struggles or even your shame right so that's going to be really really important and then the cool thing is if they can validate your struggles and your shame like then you can feel proud like it's kind of weird second thing is do some community or communities and have groups of people and then also something that like you're not expecting a lot from yourself so i would not suggest that you go and maybe you can maybe something like if you're like a math tutor but like you know try to steer clear of like intellectual activities where just ask yourself if i did a good job at this would that be the bare minimum like is that what i expect or or could i actually take pride in this kind of just ask yourself right like do i view myself as gifted in this way and if the answer is no then you should move towards that activity the tricky thing here that you've got to watch out for is that oftentimes gifted kids avoid the things that they're not gifted in does that make sense yeah can you explain it a little bit or how you understand it well yeah because if i like on some consciousness or unconscious level just understand that i look at something and think oh man i'm really going to suck at that like i don't want to do that because i'm going to suck at it and i don't want to be viewed as or view myself as being a loser in that person i feel bad perfect right so that's where i think the antidote there is that you know the reason that you're volunteering let's say is not you don't really care about i mean you will care there's a part of your mind your ego will care about how you're perceived but you're gonna go there to like try to make another human being's life a little bit better for like one day at a time does that kind of make sense so i want you to kind of let go of yourself a little bit and like go and do something that you can take pride in but you're really there to help someone else it's not really about your self-image so that's going to be like one tip that you can sort of use to try to do things outside of your comfort zone and then the last thing is letting go of expectations which is where i i think like i mentioned you need to do a little bit of deeper work where you've really got to start to ask yourself you know like when did i start to view myself as gifted what impact has it had on me um you know potentially even have a conversation with your parents about you know how like actually you've struggled a fair amount and like it's been hard for you to hear that everything is gonna be okay because sometimes things actually weren't okay right and like what i'm really hearing from you is that lots of people told you that things were gonna be okay when actually you were struggling and that sounds incredibly isolating to me that sounds to me like you really were not seen at all and in fact what was happening is people were conjuring an image of what they thought you to be instead of actually seeing who you are how does that sit with you yeah i i think that makes yeah i think that makes perfect sense yeah and so so the the way to let go of expectations is to really sit with you know josh what is the image of you and who are you and if you're open we can give that a stab now but you know i'm not expecting a whole lot because it's a it's a complicated question usually this is the kind of question that i would ask after someone had done weeks or months of work um but do you want to try answering that now or you want to just sort of work on that kind of on your own oh i'm absolutely down to it now so let me ask you what is the image of josh well i guess josh is just uh just some dude that's out there somehow trying to make or that wants to somehow try and make the world a better place i guess is that the image that other people see nope what do other people see i guess they're more like oh yeah it's just just some other dude named josh like i guess he's he seems like he he might know what he's doing he seems like a pretty uh insightful or smart guy yeah okay so when when they look at you they see someone who's insightful capable yeah does this joshua they see a great this is hopefully a good example when they see josh working out consistently do they think that josh struggles to work out or do they think he's highly motivated well i they would probably think that i'm just disciplined and i'm just it's easy right so the image of josh is insightful capable disciplined gifted and what is it like to actually be josh it's like oh man i really want to play overwatch but man i got homework to do with that let's do it like 12. all right i guess i'll go and do problems with something gosh josh are you smiling right now yeah because that's actually my situation right now and how does it got work to do and i'm actually gonna do it how does it feel to be that person it just feels kind of funny to think that i'm like a like a balloon like a bumbling buffoon just being like oh i've stopped it gotta get there okay let's get into the work you know i'm just fumbling around so i get to where i need to go yeah right and so let me ask you who deserves to take more pride the bumbling balloon who like struggles with themselves and eventually floats in the right direction right bounces themselves towards working out and doing homework and stuff like that or someone who's like oh josh this new fragrance by josh makes you insightful capable disciplined yeah no definitely the balloon guy because he's just trolling you know like he don't care so i i i mean hopefully that helps you some but i i think that just like sit with those two images and and recognize that like actually you may not be as gifted as you think you are and bizarrely that may mean that you can take pride in what you've accomplished because the truth of the matter is that your life like even though you have certain advantages and we're not saying that you don't have advantages there are like genuine things that you struggle with right and consistently working out means fighting a thousand small battles with yourself and winning at those small battles but man like each inch of territory that you gain when fighting against yourself like each each inch you've paid for with sweat and blood in tears and overwatch rating what do you think yeah i think that it's like not only do i work out like i even like practice like some yoga in the morning like i get up at 4 00 4 30 i go to sleep at like 6 seven wake up and then immediately after i do that i meditate and then study my class you know so i can get ahead and know what i'm doing even then like sometimes just doesn't those accomplishments don't really compound how do you feel about waking up at 4 30 in the morning how does it actually ask this how does it feel to wake up at 4 30 in the morning do yoga start studying well it it kind of sucks yeah yeah tell me about it like i just want to sleep and i look at my my clock on my phone like oh it's 4 32 all right i guess i'll get out of bed so i was i'm not gonna get through or whatever i'm like okay let's do it yeah dude it sounds good reluctant it sounds like you're trying to force yourself into building a better life for yourself yeah definitely because because like before um it is this is a little personal but it's not too graphic or anything like my my grandpa recently unfortunately passed away right and then whenever i went to his funeral and i mourned for him like everyone else may have just been feeling just sadness and grief and all that like i felt like a grief of a sort of sense of and we're christian um we're our fan was like a cr like christian primarily and all that and i was like thinking to myself please god just let me be a stronger person you know let me be more capable so i can actually make the world a better place and not let all these efforts that my grandpa or anyone else went through go to waste make it worth it yeah so i think it's can be healthy to ask for strength and also i i would encourage you to recognize josh that you you've probably been given that which you've asked for and the only thing that really gets in the way of seeing it is your own ego yeah probably so just spend some time with who the real josh is versus the image of josh and hopefully as you kind of navigate that maybe if you're a little bit lucky you can start to feel a little bit of pride in waking up at 4 30 every day you know being grateful to yourself for working this hard right even if pride isn't really there yet maybe you can try start with some gratitude right so like at least like hopefully your grades are getting better and you're starting to get in shape and things like that and you can be grateful to yourself for putting in the effort yeah 100 i totally want to do that well good luck to you josh any questions or last thoughts before we wrap up um well on an un on a completely unrelated note um i recently watched uh one of the videos um that was posted on the youtube channel and it was about uh how change occurs and that was just really insightful and i want to keep applying that to the rest of my life too so i can figure out how to learn and do all that and just improve and it's just just been really helpful can you give us a tl dr on the video i'm i'm not actually oh oh yeah no no 100 so basically what it's about is like you read a reddit post which was a gift of like uh basically this person saying oh yeah well i know darn well that i should be making change while they're watching your videos but they're not able to and they still don't do anything about it and then you're like yeah well you technically don't really need to do anything about it right you really just do the work in your head and and i thought that was weird at first when i heard that and then i kept watching them and it was just really insightful because then it because then those suggestions you gave in that video about uh sitting on what you learned and reflecting on it i actually did that when i walked into my backyard like right after i finished the video it made me think about how i wanted to when i played overwatch um a few years ago and i climbed to like the elo or one of the top elos in the game that's exactly what i did in order to get better at the game yeah like i watched mods i studied pro players and what they did and compared that to what i was doing and i just i just got better at it and i improved on what i needed to get better at even though i suck absolutely yes thanks for jogging my memory yeah so it's it's surprising how um people don't realize that most of change is like internal and we also don't really unders we don't really acknowledge that unless we like inten we can intentionally facilitate the process of change which i think is also the same as learning right so if we kind of think about like if i'm stuck in the same pattern over and over and over again i'll even use the phrase oh like why do i never learn and and there are actually some interesting things you can do to facilitate learning one is one of which is reflection so thanks for sharing it i'm glad that the video was able to help you good luck to you josh yeah yeah thank you keep doing what you're doing i love it thanks man it's an amazing place thanks for contributing my pleasure all right so let's just take a quick moment to recap because i think there's a lot of stuff about josh's situation that is actually quite applicable so sometimes we have difficulty taking pride in stuff which is kind of weird because we just sort of assume that everyone knows how to take pride in stuff right like it's an emotion so shouldn't everyone be capable of feeling pride the interesting thing is that some of us actually grow up in a situation where based on how certain behaviors are reinforced what kind of feedback we get it's actually like very hard to take pride in your accomplishments and so there are a couple of key things that we we can see from this situation the first is sort of growing up as a gifted kid because if you grow up as a gifted kid even if you excel that is actually the bare minimum of what is expected of you right so it's kind of interesting because if we think about like performance like if i perform at this level or if this is the performance that's expected of me and then i perform up here instead this is the window that i can take pride in right because like this is what i was expected to do and i actually ended up way over here so i should be proud of like over performing the interesting thing so if we kind of think about it if expectations are at the ceiling right if we're gifted and we're so intelligent and like oh like getting an a is so easy for us then actually what happens is it's very hard for us to feel pride because expectations are so high the best we can do is meet the minimum expectation the interesting thing is that the the the other side of the coin is also present where oftentimes gifted kids not just gifted kids but especially gifted kids even when they do poorly they're not the shame they feel the negativity they feel is oftentimes swept under the rug and so like instead of your parents telling you oh that was really hard for you you know like oh like it sounded like that you know you really struggled there sometimes what will happen is parents don't want to be negative towards their kids so they'll try to be reassuring so that when i'm reassuring i'll say things like oh like you'll be fine next time don't worry about it you got to be i'm sure you're going to get an a it's no big deal you're smart you're smart you'll figure it out the interesting thing about that kind of reassurance is that it's actually invalidating because at that in that moment when the kid really really struggled to study and wound up with a b or maybe they did study and they studied very hard and they still got to be instead of acknowledging that struggle what we do is we kind of sweep it away right oh it'll everything will be fine and interestingly enough by invalidating the struggles that gifted kids actually face we don't give them an opportunity to like improve and triumph because even if they struggled and got a b and i say oh it's totally fine you'll get an a it's not a big deal and then if they study twice as hard and they get an a is it a big deal have you progressed have you done a better job are you is this something to be proud of oh no no no this is just the expectations so interestingly enough the inability for some or some people's lack of experiencing kind of like validation when they struggle also makes it hard for them to feel pride because if i say to you oh that was actually really hard you know i know you struggled a lot i really hope you can you can try again and like i'm gonna try to help you and i know it's gonna be tough but i believe that you can do it and when we acknowledge the struggle and then when they improve things actually change right because then i can take pride in it but by sweeping the difficulties that some people face under the rug like we actually don't we sort of take away their ability to like grow and triumph and take pride in that and so oddly enough sometimes we don't really know how to feel pride and the last thing to consider when it comes to not knowing how to feel pride is if this stuff has happened to you think about the expectations you place on yourself because if you're if you internalize those expectations then even doing a good job is not pride worthy doing a good job is the minimum the only thing that you can take pro pride in is if you did exceptionally exceptionally exceptionally exceptionally well right because that's what you expect from yourself you expect your from yourself the absolute best it's a very very relatable very very common issue surprisingly and like more and more people experience this but then we we sort of like don't even recognize for a moment that pride is something that we learn how to feel in our upbringing based on certain experiences that we have and if you haven't had those experiences if your difficulties were swept away if your expectations were really really high sometimes we end up with young adults or adults who actually like kind of don't know how to feel pride even when they do a good job you
