if i've never been depressed and i see someone who is depressed and acting this way what i'm gonna think is like if i were acting that way what would be going on inside me it's like i'm very depressed for 48 hours but then if i go to a party i'm having the time of my life and i feel fantastic and the devastating thing about depression more so than any other illness is that it attacks your ability to fight back if someone's not really doesn't have a neurochemical depression and like i start prescribing a bunch of medication like i'm actually doing more harm than good right because they're not going to get any benefit from it they're going to suffer from side effects they may do things like gain weight have you know sexual side effects and stuff like that i'm actually doing them harm so it's important to understand this you really think they're depressed i mean they walk around all day long arguing getting mad yelling cursing me out just gets to walk around and act like a jerk all day it's just unbelievable seems like he just wants things handed to him he expects people to just jump and do whatever he wants i don't get it sleeps all day he's up all night he eats what he wants total junk food can't lift a pencil to do his school work i mean it's just unbelievable yeah that's exactly what i'm saying he's depressed and that's what happens when you're depressed you don't just get sad and down you also get irritable and angry imagine living your life completely cut off from feelings like contentment satisfaction happiness excitement when all you can feel is irritation anger agitation and nothing nothing brings you relief that's depression and i know you get a lot of degrees and everything but i don't know yeah so i think this is like a great representation of and this guy's a psychologist by the way so like i think it's a great representation of how hard it is for people who haven't experienced depression to understand depression so what you see on the outside is the behaviors right and then what we naturally do when we see a behavior as human beings is we attribute our own experiences and internal environments and motivation to that behavior and so that's what we assume the other person is thinking so if they were like if i've never been depressed and i see someone who is depressed and acting this way what i'm gonna think is like if i were acting that way what would be going on inside me and they conclude like if i was just like eating and sleeping like i was sleeping whenever i want to eating whatever i want to being an like that would just be me being a lazy because you've you haven't experienced depression right and so they like if i was doing that i would definitely be a lazy because like when i have done those kinds of things it has been closer to the lazy and they look at sometimes their child and they'll say like oh my god that's what they're doing too but that's because they don't really understand that the internal experience is quite different and i think this guy does a fantastic job of describing i i love the way he says cut off from so one of the key features of depression a clinical depression or major depressive disorder or a depressive episode is anhedonia so anhedonia is the inability to experience pleasure so like literally what happens is there are activities one of the key specific diagnostic questions of depression right if you're trying to figure out if someone has a major depressive disorder versus like narcissism and has had a narcissistic injury is you ask them are you able to enjoy things that you usually enjoy and for people who have personality disorders they can still enjoy stuff because their neurochemistry is like more normal let's say it's just a gross generalization but so they can still like have a good time which is why their depression fluctuates wildly it's like i'm very depressed for 48 hours but then if i go to a party i'm having the time in my life and i feel fantastic more consistent with a personality disorder so they're not actually anthodonic but if you talk to the person with personality disorder and the person with a major depressive disorder or bipolar disorder during the periods where they're depressed they'll their experience can be very similar so anhedonia is one of the key features of like clinical depression and that's the being cut off essentially from things that you enjoy so what would your mood be like if you just couldn't have fun anymore there was a block on your ability to have fun right you may get irritable you may get pissed you may find yourself chasing after things that usually help you feel good like eating like crap right you may also be getting physiologic reinforcement from some of those things that are not subjectively experienced so when you eat this is where you know sometimes there's there are elements to this that are more physiologic so for example when i eat unhealthy food even if my brain is unable to experience pleasure from it there are going to be things like taste receptors and um you know different kinds of like like chemicals like leptin and ghrelin and stuff like that that are going to get altered in a reinforcing way even though i don't enjoy it so that's why i do it if i don't enjoy it right because there are other parts of you that are reinforcing that behavior and so that's like that's honestly a good representation the other thing that i think a lot of people miss out on is that we shared this the other day but um if we look there's actually uh i'll find this again what people don't realize is that for a third of people depression manifests as anger okay so we're going to just take a quick look at this paper this is this is a really fascinating study so by maurizio fava who's i think now maybe jerry or mauricio one of them is chief of psychiatry at mass general hospital um and what he sort of what maurizio did is he he did a a study looking at anger attacks and depression and what he discovered was that approximately one third of depressed outpatients present with anger attacks so their primary experience of depression is not sadness but is anger and irritability and it's just something about the way that we're wired which interestingly enough ayurveda makes predictions for so we've steered clear of ir recently because we're just really evaluating the science some people in our community had some really good criticisms about the scientific nature or lack of scientific nature of ayurveda so we're kind of looking at that but it's interesting because ayurveda has been describing exactly this right so literally what ayurveda has been saying is that a third of people will manifest with like periods of irritability and they also call it a third because there's their bit that depression so there's a video about that if that you know on dr case guide to depression but it's interesting that you know 3 000 4 000 years later you know this guy publishes this paper that finds the exact same thing um which is why we sort of were supportive of it in the first place but anyway so it's very common that like a lot of people don't realize that depression can manifest is like being an ass now the tricky thing if we really want to complicate things the tricky thing is that sometimes will use depression as an excuse so sometimes and this is not uncommon actually or do they have depression sure sometimes they do sometimes they don't sometimes they have a subjective feeling of depression but what they've learned to do is that depression essentially gets you some benefits right like i don't have to do my chores if i'm depressed and you may say like oh dr k isn't that insensitive well it's true right and it's important to recognize that as a mental health professional and as an individual right because if i'm like if someone's not really doesn't have a neurochemical depression and like i start prescribing a bunch of medication like i'm actually doing more harm than good right because they're not going to get any benefit from it they're going to suffer from side effects they may do things like gain weight have you know sexual side effects and stuff like that i'm actually doing them harm so it's important to understand this it's really interesting so there's something something called pseudo seizures or non-epileptiform seizures so this is like seizure-like movements that are not actually caused by electrical activity in the brain so generally speaking when we have a seizure what it means is that we have unregulated electrical activity in the brain right so our like motor cortices are like firing off and so then as a result we'll like literally seize okay so that's an ep it's epilepsy it's electrical activity in the brain that's causing you to move so there's also seizure-like behavior which are called pseudo seizures which are when someone does this we'll see this sometimes on tick-tock as well where someone does this kind of stuff but it's not a seizure it's not actually like there's electrical activity in the brain that is out of control so it's called a pseudo-seizure now what's really interesting is that 50 of the people who have pseudoseizures also have real seizures it's an alarmingly high co-morbidity so they'll have real seizures and quote-unquote fake seizures or non-epileptiform seizures is what we call it and then the question becomes why is that it's because human beings are adaptable so what someone with epilepsy learns right like subconsciously what they learn is that when i have a seizure there are particular advantages to it right like people will do stuff for me people will demonstrate compassion they will care about me i don't have to do as much work i get extensions on my deadlines and then the brain is smart so the brain realizes is like cool like if i need to get out of something i've got an ace in the hole and it's really devastating hopefully i'm not you know being insensitive here but this is just medical fact the comorbidity of pseudo seizures and seizures is really high in that direction but not 50 it's not 50 of real uh people who have epileptiform seizures develop pseudo seizures that's not the statistic it's 50 of people who have pseudo seizures also have epilepsy so it goes one way not both ways if that makes sense if you guys understand like biostatistics and so that's what happens so we see this with with mental health too where some people will genuinely have mental illness and they will use that mental illness as an excuse which is how people work right and so oftentimes what we tend to see is that people who have pseudo seizures they'll send them to a psychiatrist which they absolutely hate by the way the patients hate it but what we tend to find is that the pseudo seizures are serving a function they're helping people cope communicate or get something that they need they're getting their needs met through their pseudo-seizure-like activity and if you teach them how to get their needs met in other ways the pseudo-seizures will go down now for people to say oh it's fake why are you putting up with it it's not that simple right so like is it fake sort yeah i mean it's not epileptiform but it's really coming from a very genuine place and it doesn't help to call it out it doesn't actually makes things worse right so you have to understand that people are going to do what they need to to get their needs met all right so it's interesting so i've i've seen this a lot where there's like what is that fake disorder cringe or something where it's like you know people are you know it's a lot like it's really easy to judge on the internet like look at someone be like oh my god this guy's like so terrible person it's like sure there may be an element of that's true but it's complicated people who have pseudo-seizures or as people put it fake disorders they're not necessarily bad people are they making things more complicated sure is it sometimes very insensitive to people who are actually like have an epilep epileptic condition absolutely so there are criticisms to be made but there's also like some amount of understanding to be had right there's some amount of compassion and like what like people don't just wake up one day and like i'mma pretend to be mentally ill like think about what your life would have to be like in order to do that so what i see what i've personally seen is that trauma is like the biggest thing that makes me think about this stuff [Music] so this is kind of a this is a it captures very very very very quickly one of the biggest problems with depression so internally i made this connection i don't really share it publicly because i think it comes with connotations that are probably not good to share but when i was training to become a psychiatrist i realized one day in my mind i made this connection that depression is almost the hiv of mental illness now there's a lot of things that are problematic with that comparison so don't hold me to that but here's the connection that i made it's just like my neurons form this thing so the reason that hiv is so devastating is because it attacks your ability to fight back and the devastating thing about depression more so than any other illness is that it attacks your ability to fight back right so like it's one thing to be suicidal but it's another thing to deserve that you want to die or that you sorry that you deserve to die so you can see suicidality for example in schizophrenia right and even if you see suicidality and schizophrenia the reason they're suicidal is because they're suffering so much it's not that they deserve to die it's that they're being tracked the devil is like hunting them the fbi is following them you'll see like all these kind of delusional kind of thinking and so like the only escape that you have is death but even in that moment if i if i talk to someone who has a psychotic disorder hopefully and i sort of say like hey if i can like make all this stuff go away would you want to live and they'd say like yes absolutely it's been my experience anyway but in depression people your mind is working against you and so it handicaps your ability to fight back so the more that you struggle right like you get all these weird paradoxical responses that keep you from getting better so like no one cares about you that's what your mind tells you right like i need help but no one cares about you paradoxically we see this even with mental health professionals when i have a patient who's got depression who stops showing up at my office i get really worried right because like and even afterward like i'll talk to them i mean thankfully things have gone generally well i've been pretty lucky and my patients have been quite resilient they'll come to me and they'll be like you know i was thinking like i didn't want to disappoint you really common one because i did so well i was doing so well for like 12 months 14 months like we're meditating we're doing yoga we're putting in all this effort and you're such a good doctor you care so much and like as i got sick i realized like it must be me and i was so ashamed to come because it means that like even you can't help me and i didn't want to disappoint you happens so much such a big problem as a therapist that your patients want you to respect them they want you to be proud of them they want the treatment to work you're working hard they're working hard you care so much you deserve to have a triumph as a treater so the patient prioritizes your feelings over their own they feel doubly worse so when they should come to the office they don't and if y'all are sitting at home skipping therapist therapy appointments you should absolutely go i can i mean i can't guarantee you but i feel very confident that if you have a halfway decent therapist they will not be disappointed if you get sick in fact they're the ones who understand that it comes and goes being depressed is not a personal failing right that's the biggest problem is that like clinicians understand that whereas patients don't people don't especially when the depression strikes because when the depression strikes your brain is well your brain is blaming you so even if intellectually you understand that it's not your fault but your blame your brain is going to be blaming you for whatever it can oh yeah if you were a better patient you wouldn't be so depressed if you had done more yoga if you had done more meditation it's always there pointing the finger at you right no one else's fault all your fault it even says crazy thoughts like people would be better without you like oh like can you imagine how bad your doctor feels when you come in week after week after week and don't get better you do the world a favor by helping your doctor help someone else who deserves to be helped these are all the crazy thoughts it sends you and that's what i mean when i say it's like the hiv of mental illness like it attacks you on such a fundamental level that it makes everything your fault you can't fight back and then you retreat from the very things that you need the other thing that it kind of just reminded me of in this moment is something like rabies where like the more dehydrated you are you're afraid of water and that which will save you you want to run away from and so that's why it's so devastating but it's really important to understand this that like the whole point is that in depression your mind is always going to be telling you that it's your fault and that's why it's weird but you have to learn to distrust the mind right a healthy amount of distrust of your own mind is good it's part of yoga it's the recognition that your mind is not an arbiter of truth or reality it's just your mind it's full of cognitive biases and so that's where sometimes even on stream and stuff we'll try to point out to people how their mind works it's not a clinical intervention it's just like everyone should understand what is my mind doing now why is it doing that what are the patterns of my mind what does it learn how to do and as you learn the patterns of your mind hopefully you will gain the ability to overcome it right and for people who are saying distrust i'm not saying a hundred percent i'm saying be skeptical because your mind i know it's kind of weird let's think about this for a second your mind has the capacity to be wrong right so you shouldn't trust it 100 it's right most of the time but it's really really important for you to understand which of the thoughts are wrong as bashwick is saying not my mind where did that thought come from it's funny i know you're joking but that's actually what happens in depression is the mind tells you no no i'm 100 correct i know you have some thoughts that make you think that your family love you but no no listen to me listen to me i'm the one who's looking out for you so it's hard really hard what if my thinking about flawed thinking is flawed very good question this is why you need to do and as patanjali put it there's two kinds of knowledge right knowledge and wrong knowledge you
