all right today we're going to talk a little bit about setting boundaries boundary but this is going to be a little bit different because I know there's a lot of discussion out there about oh like you need to learn how to set boundaries like I need to set boundaries everyone's like set boundaries with your boss like set boundaries right like and psychiatrists or clinicians like me and we'll get to this are like here's how you set boundaries like because we have studied this we are the experts the problem is that a lot of people who struggle to set boundaries don't struggle because it's hard to set boundaries a lot of the reason that it's hard to set boundaries is because the person that you're setting boundaries with doesn't give a crap about your boundaries I want to take a moment to thank our HD coaches I've taught it a lot of different places and worked with a lot of different people and honestly our coaches are some of the best people I've ever worked with HG coaches have helped over 10 000 people find purpose Direction and improve their mental health after about 20 weeks of coaching the average client experiences a 58 Improvement in sense of purpose in life a 45 Improvement in feelings of anxiety and even a 35 reduction in feelings of Despair and this isn't just me saying this at this point we've done this for three years run six research studies and even presented our findings at the American Psychiatric association National Conference over one hundred thousand sessions later I can confidently say this works so if you're interested in checking out he coaching for yourself go to healthygamer.gg coaching to learn more how do you set a boundary with like a parent when you live at home how do you had for whom you're like financially beholden to and so that's what's really challenging and I sort of learned this kind of the hard way so I I was doing a Consulting gig and someone kind of like asked me a question I was giving a set a talk on Boundary setting and as a psychiatrist right like so trained at Harvard Medical School and all this good stuff and then this person was like yeah I don't think that's going to work with my family and I was like no no no it'll work and and this person was like I don't think you know my grandmother like this would never work with her and so I I was like no no it'll really work and we didn't really get much resolution there and I ended up talking to that person afterward and I talked to a lot of other people and I started asking people that I was working with like hey what do you think about this boundary setting stuff like do you think it would work for you or not work for you and what I found was essentially one big thing which is that boundary setting works really well when you're in a position of power just to give you all an example like let's say I'm have a patient who's got a stimulant medication like Adderall or you know methylphenidate or something like that this is a stimulant medication and they lose their medication and they come to me and they say Dr K I lost my medication and this is where we learn how to set boundaries sorry bro you lost your medication you can get in 15 days tough luck we're like set the boundary and if the patient gets pissed off you can say okay fine you can get pissed at me I'm not going to refill your medication if you never want to see me again adios and so it's easy right so this is the key thing about a lot of clinicians and this is something we take for granted is that when we're learning how to set boundaries we're in a position of power and so it's easy to set boundaries when you're in a position of power even when it comes to things like people with narcissistic parents once you're financially independent and out of the household it's easy I mean it can still be emotionally very difficult but you don't have to see this person every day right you're not stuck at home a lot of what I'm kind of getting this from I'm getting this information from a couple of different places that's a little bit unusual the first place is that I worked with a lot of narcissists in my practice so I did a lot of addiction Psychiatry I worked with a lot of like Executives and and you know like people who are very successful so a lot of them are like pretty narcissistic and even in that situation there was kind of a power Dynamic but like it was somewhat there but what I really am sort of basing this on is not the boundaries I set with them but I paid attention to people in their lives who were able to successfully set boundaries to them the other kind of perspective that I have here I know this sounds kind of different but it's honestly like a coaching perspective so just to give you all an example so as a clinician you know I'm going to teach people how to set boundaries and work with narcissists and things like that but if you look at the field of coaching these are people who hey yeah my boss is an absolute narcissist they control my schedule they control my pay how do I successfully work with this person so let's start by understanding how to set these boundaries and if we want to understand that let's understand a little bit about narcissists okay because usually the people that you're going to have difficulty with is people who are quite narcissistic there are two things to understand about narcissists the first is that they require other people to build their self-esteem and they have particular emotional needs that they need to be met so a narcissist doesn't feel good about themselves on their own which means they need other people to feel good about them now this becomes a huge problem if a narcissist is in a position of power over you right because now what they can do is if you don't fulfill their emotional needs and if you don't give them respect they're going to punish you they can punish you emotionally they can punish you financially they can punish you in all kinds of ways especially if it's something like a parent so if someone calls you and is like okay hey like I really need your help I really need your help like let's say it's your best friend or let's say it's your partner and they call you and they say oh I need you I need you I need you I need you I'm suicidal I'm suicidal please drop everything you're doing and come and rescue me and you may say to yourself how is this an unfair power dynamic because we're both in relation we're in a relationship with like they're my partner I'm their partner we're on equal footing and then if you say no they're like oh my God I'm gonna kill myself I'm gonna kill myself I'm gonna kill myself you don't love me you don't love me you don't love me absolutely a power dynamic because they're manipulating you emotionally and then you cave and you run over there because you don't want them to kill themselves you love them so they're bludgeoning you with guilt so that's absolutely a power Dynamic okay other situations include things like you know parents calling Hey so so you're you know you're are you coming home for Christmas when are you coming home from Christmas how much are you time are you going to spend with me how much time are you going to spend with your dad's place you know like what's going on there so like people will will really be looking to you to fulfill their emotional needs and they really want something from you and the problem with narcissists if you don't give them what they want they punish you for it okay so here are a couple of tips that honestly work really well it's sort of boundary setting and managing things with narcissists don't lay a boundary don't notify someone of a boundary when they need something from you okay so if someone is calling you and saying hey I need you to drop everything you're doing because I am suffering right now or a boss calls you and says hey everything is on fire I need you to drop what you're doing and fix this thing trying to set a boundary with them will cause them to escalate they're like bro do you not understand what I'm saying you need to do this otherwise you're not going to have a job otherwise I'm going to kill myself otherwise this this this this this this so when their needs acutely need to be met it's a terrible time to lay a boundary so what you want to do is lay the boundary well in advance hey boss by the way just FYI I'm gonna be camping this weekend and so I won't be available on cell phone use or things like that you mentioned this on Wednesday anything that I need to take care of on Thursday or Friday ideally you want to send it to him in writing or something like that and in the case of something like a parent or you know a friend who's who who needs your help or something like that if they call you all the time and they're kind of emotionally dumping you can say hey by the way I've got a big test coming up on Monday um I may not be as available to you over the weekend so so let them know well in advance the second thing to do is when they ignore your boundary because that's what they're gonna do what you want to do is like like keep that boundary firm but then never blame them for the problem so for example if someone calls you for emotional support and and you're like hey like I don't have time for you right now I have a test on Monday I cannot afford to listen to you I told you on Wednesday that I have a test on Monday and you didn't listen and now you're calling for me for emotional support I told you so I told you so I told you so they are absolutely going to escalate because what are you doing in that moment you're making them feel worse about themselves you did tell them so you gave them plenty of warning and that makes them feel more idiotic and the more idiotic they feel the worse they feel the more they will escalate and the more they will try to manipulate you so instead what you do don't blame them cite in some way your own shortcoming and you can say hey I'm so sorry this sounds so important it sounds like you're really struggling right now I cannot focus my mind I've been studying all day long this sounds so incredibly important but my mind is just not hearing what you're saying it really sounds like you need my help right now and I really want to help you I'm so sorry I'm just not able to right now I wish I could magically do something that would make me be able to like do a better job at listening I just my my mind is jelly can we try to talk about this tomorrow morning so what you want to do is lay that boundary and incite your own shortcoming in some way you don't need to belabor it you don't need to justify it very much you want to just say it briefly hey you deserve more than what I can offer okay that's the kind of message that you want to send and here's the third really important thing you need to give them an alternative to getting their needs met you can't just say no you have to give them a second option because remember the narcissist wants to get their needs met and so you are saying absolutely you can absolutely get your needs met but we're gonna do it tomorrow we're not gonna do it right now and eventually what you want to do is almost like I know it sounds kind of weird but like almost manipulate them into preferring the second thing over the first you sort of give them a choice where I can do a crappy job of validating you right now or I can do a great job of validating you tomorrow morning which one do you want and even if it comes to something like a boss who's like hey I need you to come in like on on Saturday like hey I'm sorry I'm far away I can't come in right now but I'm happy to try to come in like you know I'll check in with you all like on Sunday afternoon the second I get back to internet and this is where you're saying but aren't you just appeasing them aren't you just kicking the bucket what you're actually doing is laying a boundary on them and if you're in an unfavorable power Dynamic you can't draw a line in the sand that they're going to respect so you have to sort of give them another option that is better for you where they can still get their emotional needs met so I've seen this a lot especially with people like you know kids who are living with parents where the parent is like I need you to drop everything that you're doing right now if you really can't control it that's totally fine but sometimes when parents need you emotion are calling you like oh man like I'm struggling right now like these are parents who will you know be infantilized themselves and their child takes the role of the parent so now you've got a child who's providing emotional support for their parents and how do you set a boundary on that person so you have to give them an alternative that's kind of easier for you and that's the boundary that you really have to hold as best as you can and you can say hey I'll be available I'll call you first thing tomorrow morning at 9am so I know it sounds kind of weird but if you're in an unfavorable power Dynamic situation there are a couple of key things that you have to remember the first is that if they can bludgeon you they will so what you want to do as best as you can is try to avoid that by letting them know in advance and when the issue comes around you remind them of the boundary but don't blame them blaming them will escalate everything and they will crush you so you can say hey this is a shortcoming on my part I'm so sorry and then what you want to do is give them an alternative to get their emotional needs met over time what they'll discover is oh like okay that's fine like because tomorrow morning they called at 9am when you call tomorrow morning at 9am what do you think is going to happen you think they're gonna talk to you for an hour 50 chance they're gonna be like no I'm totally fine and they're kind of upset and then they can't really be that mad at you which is exactly what you want but they've sort of learned all like I'm barking up the wrong tree here and if you do that a couple of times you'll sort of like learn that okay like I'm not gonna get what I need out of this person I need to go somewhere else to get my emotional leads met and that's actually exactly what you want because that means that they're gonna stop calling you so be super careful about this stuff I know it's kind of shady but like honestly this is the kind of stuff that is not something that I learned as a therapist because as a therapist this is the biggest problem is that sometimes people who will give advice about how to set boundaries have all the power and it's easy to like I can teach you how to set boundaries with your child like that's easy like I can set boundaries with my childhood however I want because I'm the one with all the power the problem is and we get this request so much hey Dr K we've heard your advice about boundary setting but what do I do if I'm a kid who's alone at home and I'm depending on my parents for money you can still use this technique right so this is something that oddly enough I discovered through all of my coaching relationships which is how do you handle a narcissistic boss secondly when they've tried to violate your boundary don't blame them for it it's gonna make things worse give them an alternative that works a little bit better on your timeline and the cool thing is you can continue to shift that right oh hey I'm so sorry that your your things are falling apart right now don't say anything like I'm at dinner with my friends I can't talk because that's gonna like emphasize that someone else is more important than them right you can't tell your boss hey I'm sorry I can't drop everything that I'm doing and come to work right now I am getting married and then your boss is going to be like  you better leave your spouse at the altar and get your ass down here because our toilet is clogged instead what you have to do is just own it and say hey I'm so sorry I'm not able to do that right now I feel terrible about it can I call you first thing tomorrow and and push a little bit push but this is a really effective technique and the key thing here is that if you're in a situation where you don't have a power in the relationship you have to still meet their need because otherwise they'll bludgeon you but you can still set a boundary in overtime push it out a little bit and even though they're you're responsible for meeting their needs you can meet their needs on your terms and that's ultimately how you set boundaries with people who are narcissistic or have power dynamics foreign
