today we're going to talk a little bit about Detachment apathy and motivation and a lot of people like myself will talk about the value of Detachment right we'll say that based on all these spiritual Traditions that you should detach from the world and as you detach from stuff you'll be happier you'll be more content you'll be more free and sometimes even more productive hey there thanks for watching and I'm glad these videos have been helpful a lot of times I'll read the comments and see people asking well what do I actually do about it which is such a great question and unfortunately my experience has been that the resources out there aren't actually that good at helping people create sustainable change which is why I started HG in the first place he coaches are trained on a curriculum that integrates all of my understanding into what is motivation what paralyzes Us and how to create lasting behavioral change so if you're ready to take the next step he coaches are ready to build the life that you want they helped people build careers find relationships build networks of friends discover what their passions are and pursue their Hobbies so if this sounds like something that you'd be interested in check out the link in the description below but a lot of times that seems really confusing for people right because if you really think about it it's your attachment to things that actually gets you motivated and moving forward and a lot of people get confused by this concept of Detachment versus apathy because if I detach from stuff doesn't that mean that I stop caring and caring is the only thing that actually keeps me going and a lot of people who will listen to to people talk about Detachment will kind of conclude that okay I can't afford to be detached because if I become a detached then like I'm gonna sit around and do nothing in fact this sort of apathetic nihilistic mentally checked out stuff is actually what I struggle with every day what I struggle with is to find motivation and so today what we're going to do is explain a little bit about the difference between Detachment and apathy and in some ways how they're almost completely Polar Opposites and we'll talk a little bit about the value and explain why Detachment can be so good and most importantly we're going to sort of explain to you all the mechanism behind which Detachment actually helps people move forward so in order to understand this we have to start with an understanding of how we normally motivate ourselves so normally I have some kind of internal drive and I have some sort of external resistance so a good example of this is that let's say I'm ambitious and I want to accomplish a lot but I hate my job so this is the sort of situation where I don't want to work I don't really enjoy work it's kind of like this barrier that I have to overcome and what allows me to overcome the barrier of the boringness of work the toxicity of work the diminishing returns that I get from putting in effort what I have to do to overcome the negative situation at work is some amount of ambition and so some of you all may sort of really wish that you were more ambitious right because we see people who are doing the sigma grind set and they're like super super ambitious and they will tolerate a ton of pain and they're like yeah like you know I'm going to be hardcore and like yeah like life sucks because you've got to like be super ambitious and so what we sort of do is we have this internal driver that we use to over come the hump of resistance and then what happens is there's this little like equation that goes on in our head right work sucks so much so that sort of creates a certain amount of resistance and if I'm ambitious enough I can overcome the hump of disliking work and that actually leads me to action which then leads me to benefits like success and money and promotions and things like that so this is sort of normally how we motivate ourselves there's sort of this internal struggle between the world sucking out there and me ramping myself up internally really juicing myself to overcome those negatives another really good example of this if we want to step out outside of work for a second is loneliness and anxiety this is something that we deal with a ton in this community I've helped a ton of patients with this kind of stuff where it's like okay so I'm socially anxious and it's hard for me to make friends when I go out and I meet people like oh my God it's like so painful like I look stupid I sound stupid everyone's judging me all the time social media definitely doesn't help that kind of stuff so what happens is we kind of move out into the world we get bludgeoned by our social anxiety and then we retreat and when we Retreat what starts to build up a sense of loneliness and so there's some research that shows that this is the Loneliest generation in the history of humanity and so the loneliness builds and builds and builds and builds and builds until it overcomes the resistance from the social anxiety right so here's this barrier of social anxiety we try to you know move out into the world and we get swatted back and then the loneliness Rises Rises Rises Rises and once the loneliness surpasses the anxiety Then we're so desperate that we can't afford to be anxious anymore and then we start moving forward and so if we think a little bit about what drives us forward in life it's this thing over here right it's that level of anxiety it's that feeling of loneliness it's the desperation of always being alone and this is what we sort of think about as caring because sometimes that stuff like if that gets too toxic or too harmful what we end up doing is becoming apathetic right so like if I don't have that driver so I have social anxiety over here and the loneliness is building up over here but if I become apathetic if I mentally check out at work if I sort of numb myself from the loneliness that's really what apathy is I stop caring about life and then I'm kind of stuck and so that's usually how we work right because if we're apathetic we're not doing anything and the only thing that we can use to overcome that hump is actually caring a lot the more I care about my job the more that I care about not being alone anymore the more I'm actually going to motivate myself forward but this is not really like a healthy or sustainable way to live life right in the case of ambition it results in Burnout and in the case of like you know loneliness like it's it's so terrible I mean hopefully you all don't know but unfortunately chances are many of you do that the struggle between loneliness saying anxiety sucks like no matter how you cut it even if the loneliness Rises to the point where you move out into the world it's still a painful experience and so what a lot of people will think is that okay like I can't afford to give up my attachments I can't afford to give up the loneliness I can't afford to give up the the ambition because then how am I going to do anything and this is where Detachment enters the picture because Detachment is not about detaching from the world it's actually about detaching from yourself so when we really think about what Detachment is so like here's the world down here and here's us up here and we kind of sit in the middle and I know that sounds kind of weird what do I mean by that so we kind of sit over here and what we think Detachment means that we think it means removing ourselves from the world right like I'm gonna stop caring about stuff but if you really look at it what Detachment truly means is removal from our own ego so when we remove ourselves from our ego that's when we actually become detached now what does that mean so I'll give you all kind of a simple example let's say I want to dance at a party so I'm hearing the music the music is fantastic I really really feel like dancing what is it that keeps me from dancing because I can hear the music I want to move maybe I don't know how to dance but who the hell cares right generally speaking people who like dancing to music don't care if they know how to dance or don't know how to dance you can still dance to the music and enjoy it but what is it that keeps you from enjoying that moment in the world it's not the world itself it's your own ego it's this idea that oh my God if I start dancing I will look stupid because I don't know how to dance people will think I'm an idiot people it's going to be so embarrassing what will people think so in that moment there you are existing in the world and you have something in the world that you want to do that you really want to do that you crave doing that you are jealous when you see other people who are able to do it and you're unable to do it and what is it that keeps you from doing it it's not actually the world it's not because the music sucks the music is fantastic what keeps you from doing it is actually your attachment to your own ego so this is the thing that's really really important to understand when we're talking about detaching we're not moving away from the world towards ourselves we're actually moving away from ourselves and actually towards the world and this is why people who are eight are detached are able to dance like there ain't no tomorrow they're able to actually live life to the fullest if they go to karaoke they can just sing karaoke and not worry about what other people think imagine what would happen if you went to a party and you didn't care what other people thought because if you really tunnel down into it what is it that when we say care what other people think what aspect of other people's thoughts do you actually care about you care about their opinion of you their opinion of you is attached to your ego in the way that you're viewed right when a narcissistic person has a big ego what does that mean that means that everyone needs to think positively about the narcissistic person so this is the key thing to understand that Detachment and apathy and we'll get into this a little bit more in a second or actually complete opposites and what we're not removing ourselves from the world what we're actually doing is moving more into the world and removing ourselves from ourselves so what does that mean in terms of that motivation kind of diagram that we were thinking about right because here's my ambition here's my feeling of loneliness and then there's the resistance that I encounter so that resistance is things like oh my God what will people think or I dislike my job and so if we look at that resistance that keeps us from moving forward in life that resistance is usually composed of emotions and ego and so what a Detachment actually does is it lowers that resistance and the beautiful thing is that once we lower the resistance once there is no hump to overcome then we can be driven forward by all kinds of things we no longer need ambition to act we no longer need that loneliness to move out and engage with people and that may sound a little bit weird but let's like tunnel down into that so what Detachment actually does is lowers that resistance and how does it do that because let's go back to the social example I'm really lonely and I have social anxiety so let's tunnel down into okay what is social anxiety social anxiety is the concern of what other people think about you right that's what social anxiety is I'm worried what other people are going to think now if I stopped worrying what other people thought that would be freeing that would be amazing in the most important thing is that if I stopped caring what other people thought I don't need loneliness to drive me to engage with other people I can engage with other people through all kinds of other things like hey that person likes something that I like that can drive me to form a connection with them what about the work scenario right because in work but I genuinely hate the work so this is where you got to stop for a second and you really got to think why do you hate the work so if you really talk to people and we do this a lot for example through career coaching we worked with hundreds of people now and we understand why people hate their jobs a lot of times the reason that people hate their jobs is because they're not recognized in their jobs the effort that they put in is not appreciated that they have trouble advocating for themselves and people are playing politics sometimes it's because the job is really really really boring and even in those cases why don't those people quit those jobs well because they're afraid of the consequences of quitting a job what if I don't find another job what if people won't hire me somewhere else so even if you look at each of those scenarios about why we hate the job what we actually discover is that it's not the job itself that actually keeps you stuck it's all of your attachments related to the job it's wanting to be appreciated by your boss wanting to be recognized wanting to be respected by your peers which by the way is what leads you to work extra hard to get that recognition so any way you cut it what you really discover is that attachment and ego are really the things that kind of hold us back in life and since we're so attached to the opinions of others we have to start to use these dirty fuels these toxic motivators like ambition and loneliness to actually move us forward and then we get kind of stuck because we believe that Detachment means getting rid of our ambition or getting rid of our loneliness whereas that's not actually what we're saying at all we're not saying that you're getting rid of either of those what we're saying is that Detachment lowers the resistance and so hopefully this is kind of making sense and I want you all to just think a little bit about what would life be like if there was no resistance to what you wanted to do if you had a particular desire and your ego didn't say hey that's going to make you look stupid or you weren't operating out of like fear of consequences or things like that what would your life actually be like and this is where a lot of people think well don't I need ambition or loneliness to motivate me no because once the the resistance drops down to zero then all kinds of stuff can motivate you interest in particular things curiosity all kinds of stuff actually naturally starts motivating you why aren't you motivated Enough by those things right now because curiosity is not enough to overcome the ego right you can be curious about learning how to dance and hey like you go to a party and you're like hey like let me like learn how to dance right let me be curious about this that's beautiful but the problem is that that curiosity is not enough to overcome the ego which is why you don't live a life that is driven by curiosity you live a life that's driven by loneliness or ambition and so this is the beauty of Detachment because it lowers that resistance it separates us from the ego and it actually starts allowing us to live a life that's based on things like curiosity and interest as opposed to like desperation loneliness or ambition and so hopefully now you're kind of thinking okay so like this sounds pretty cool like lowering that resistance seems pretty neat so then the question naturally becomes how do we cultivate detachment and so now what we're going to talk about is sanskrit phrase called vairagya so virage is the Sanskrit word for detachment and there are certain ways that we cultivate Detachment and the most important way that we cultivate Detachment is actually through awareness so this may sound kind of confusing because in the west especially we have this idea that the way to get better in life is to do more stuff right like people who succeed are doing more stuff than people who don't if you want to get ahead you have to network more you got to play politics you got to update your profile on LinkedIn the more you do the more you get right and this is something that a lot of like success influencers and sigma grind set folks are like work harder like have your hustle and have your side hustle and have your side side hustle in your mini side hustle and like right you got to do more to get more even at work right people will say like it's the go-getters who get promoted and so this is the really bizarre thing but that's actually not how it works and if you talk to people who are lonely or are ambitious what you'll find is that they exert a lot of effort right so even if you're someone or you maybe have a friend who's like stuck at home and struggles with anxiety if you actually ask that person how much effort are you exerting they may be like self-judgmental and they'll say oh I don't do anything but if you actually look at the struggle of their day-to-day life it's actually really hard right because even going out is like climbing a mountain these little things that are easy for other people require so much effort from the person who is more attached who is more engaged with their ego so this is where it's kind of bizarre but the source of iraqia the most important source of Iraq is actually awareness and what do we mean by that or how does that work so this is really simple where awareness precedes control so if you've ever had dental work done this is like the classic example that I use and you're numbed you can't control anything if you can't feel it you can't control it right you can also look at things like let's say people who are alcoholic and in denial they are unaware that there is a problem and without awareness that there's a problem they can't really fix it but if you talk to someone who's an alcoholic and is like going through divorce proceedings and getting like written up at work the amount of effort they're putting forward is actually astronomically High every single day that they live is a struggle in a fight and your spouse is arguing with you your kids are mad at you bosses are writing you up there is so much effort but there is no awareness and we also know that based on evidence-based treatment of alcoholism what is the solution the solution is actually Insight or awareness right and you we kind of hear it in places like Alcoholics Anonymous where they start every meeting with awareness building hi my name is all Oak and I am an alcoholic and that is so foundational because once you understand that they're once you understand what's going on once you have awareness of not just the problem but the whole system then things actually become effortless and there's one really good example of this which is like I don't know if y'all play video games but like if you're good at a video game people will look at you and will say wow that is so amazing you must work really hard to be good at the the video game it looks so effortful but when you're good at a video game you actually don't expend a whole lot of effort it's actually easy for you right but the question is why is it easy for you because you understand you understand the mechanics of the game you understand the meta of the game the more that you understand the more easy things become and this is the key thing about cultivating Detachment this is what the Yogi's figured out is that if you want to live an easy life that is also happens to be like more productive then you need to actually start with awareness because as as long as we are numb to stuff and as long as we don't understand how things work it's we can exert all the effort in the world and it's going to yield very few returns and so then the question becomes okay how do we cultivate this awareness and this is where there are a couple of simple answers the first is meditation and now some of y'all may be listening to this and thinking okay so so are you saying just meditate and like sort of right but I don't want you all to just meditate what I want you all to understand is even if you're thinking okay meditation doesn't work for me I've tried it a bunch it doesn't help with these problems you're missing the point what I want you to understand is why meditation works why we use meditation as the key way to develop Detachment because Yogi's tested all kinds of stuff and what they settled on is meditation and why is that it's because meditation is the practice literally the practice where we skill up our ability to be aware so the first thing is you should meditate and what does that meditation mean it means just be aware of stuff the second thing that I strongly recommend that you do is spend time with yourself so if we're talking about awareness a key thing that we really want to be aware of is our reactions to stuff because it is in our reactions to stuff that we actually find our attachments so if we go back to dancing at a party what am I attached to it's going to manifest in the way that I react when I'm at the party so if I want to dance and the music is fantastic and I really want to dance and then notice the reaction that you have within yourself and that reaction will actually give you insight into the nature of the attachment we spend so much time trying to overcome that reaction right we wrestle with ourselves we try to overcome and Conquer anxiety that we don't ever spend any time just sitting there and observing it and so that's the the problem is that effort over that anxiety is not going to ultimately lead to success what's ultimately going to lead to success is awareness and so notice your own reactions to things and in in that sense spend a little bit more time just with yourself and the last thing that I want to share with y'all is a little bit of how you could be reacting to this video so I want you all to notice that when I say hey like spend some time like noticing things notice your reaction to things maybe try meditating what is your reaction to this video right there's a decent chance that there's a fair number of y'all that are saying oh my God he's saying just meditate I've tried that before it won't work so that's kind of interesting right so if you've been following me this far or thus far hopefully you kind of like kind of buy what I'm selling in the sense that we have these driving motivators we have these resistances and we rely on jacking up our motivation to overcome the resistance and wouldn't it be awesome if we no longer had that resistance you're like yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah but once I start telling you okay all you need to do is be aware then what is your reaction to that it's like no no no no that's not going to be enough because I've tried so hard and it hasn't worked exactly so stop trying so hard notice your own intrinsic reaction because chances are that if you really tunnel down into that and this is how you want to know how to build awareness we're going to do it right now tunnel down into that why are you so skeptical that this is going to work if you tunnel down into your skepticism there's going to be emotion there right there's going to be fear what if it doesn't work or it's going to be frustration and regret I've tried this before and it didn't work I don't want to waste my time there's going to be all kinds of emotions negative emotions tied to your resistance to doing what I'm asking you to do right because that's what it is it's the resistance and what is the resistance it's emotion and anytime there's negative motion there's ego and so now we see in this moment that if you try to push forward you'll feel that resistance and it'll actually it's actually telling you don't do it don't do it don't do it and how do we actually overcome that notice that reaction we can do it right now notice that reaction why is it that I'm so resistant to trying this why is it that I'm so resistant to meditating because I've tried it and it didn't work I've been burned I've wasted my time I can't afford to waste time anymore and if you have those kinds of thoughts what is that those are attachments right you can't afford it oh my God the only times we can't afford things are when we're attached to things I can't afford to set boundaries with my boss I can't afford to rock the boat in my relationship when you can't afford to do something that's an attachment so I know it sounds kind of bizarre but the truth of the matter is that Detachment and apathy are actually complete opposites and it's the fact that we get confused about that that we assume that those are the same thing that we actually try not to cultivate Detachment because we've started to build a system of motivation that relies on attachment to overcome our resistance that's the only way we can move forward but if you really want to be free of all of that crap and be free from the only motivator being this toxic motivator or dirty fuel like ambition or loneliness or desperation then you have to cultivate Detachment and the beauty is that cultivating Detachment from your own ego allows you to actually live more fully within the world
