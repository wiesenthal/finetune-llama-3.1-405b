and so paradoxically the more we invest into something the more we view ourselves as an author the more that we strive for success in writing the harder it becomes to write there are many people who will offer solutions for life do this and you will be happy do that and be happy it is my opinion that you must understand yourself first that is why we made Dr K guide check it out nah a writer who never writes I identify a lot with Dr K what Dr K says about gifted kids except I'm 40. my failed College sensor long behind me I've achieved a lot in life truly but good financial success is not among my achievements 13 years ago I dedicated my life to writing fiction I've written a lot outlined even more but shared little I fear failure comparison and how those failures would sink my chances of keeping a future reader this fear is so all-encompassing that I would rather not write and just play video games or write Pathfinder module tools anything but tell the stories that I could sell professionally to make money for my family does anyone have any insight into how I might overcome this limitation storytelling has been my passion since I was nine and I would love to do it as a profession I know writing very well this is not a skill issue it's 100 a psychological issue what a beautiful beautiful post so we've talked a lot about gifted kids but those gifted kids sometimes grow into adults and the hard thing about being an adult and not being successful is that while you're a kid you've got potential you've got time like even if you screw up a little bit when you're 18 19 20 you got time to sort of get back on track and sort of do what you're supposed to do but then you kind of grow into an adult and then you're on the downhill right you're 40 years old maybe you're 35 maybe you're 45 and sure Dr chaos all this advice about how you can put your life together when you're in your 20s but some of us are kind of over the hump and then we're kind of struggling because this is something that we really want to do right and you can sort of look at your life and you can say I've accomplished a lot I've grown a lot but there's just this one thing and then the real weird Paradox here is that it's not even a skill issue you know you're good at it right you've been dedicating your life to it it's been your passion your entire life or maybe you discovered it a little bit later and you're putting in the hours and you're putting in the work and you know you're confident that you can do it you feel stuck and despite the more that you practice the more that you train you're never ready to actually take the plunge you practice and you practice and you practice and you're not ready and you're not ready and you're not ready so how do you overcome this because at some point you begin to realize practicing I don't know if I can ever like write the perfect novel right at some point you got to take the plunge but you can't and that feels kind of weird right so what's going on here so I want you all to put yourselves in the mind of a 40 year old whose passion has been writing their entire life who spent 13 years training their craft so this person hasn't been financially successful they've figured out all all the other parts of their life this is their white whale this is their raid boss this is the final challenge so you're a 40 year old you've got to make something of your life right there's a lot of pressure you gotta make something of your life and now you've invested all of your energy into this and so what if you fail right so this sort of becomes okay I'm afraid of failure the person even knows that I compare myself to others we even know that but why can't we overcome this and it turns out that all the things that we think we have done to set ourselves up for Success actually are the things that paralyze us right because if this was my passion since I was nine and if I take the plunge and if I fail then what am I I've been writing for 13 years I'm so good at it it's a hundred percent not a skill issue I'm supremely confident why can't you write it's because of the ego because what you want to be is an author right and as the years of your life fly by endures and opportunities close behind you you've got one door left you're all in on this one thing you want to be a 6 successful author and what excuse do you have you've got the skill you've got the passion you're one of these success stories right oh yeah this person started writing at the age of nine oh my God and they devoted their entire life to it and then they published their first novel and what a great success it was and this is what you strive for as you've made sacrifices as you've made Investments you've got one door left to be a successful author that's what you really want to be and so you learn about how to become a successful author you practice you do this you do this you do this all the tea yourself up for success and paradoxically the more effort you put into trying to be successful the more paralyzed you become because think about it if you go all in on this thing and you lose you lose everything and now we can also see why this person has moved forward in other parts of their life how have they been successful in so many ways well because that wasn't as important to them does that make sense because you could afford failure over it this isn't who you are this isn't who you strive to be this isn't what what you were put on this Earth for and so all of those things you can take a chance but I want you all to think for a second about how crushing it would be to be 40 years old be passionate about writing since the age of nine spend 13 years on your craft and get rejected then who are you that final door closes the reason that you were put on your Earth all of your passion all of your effort all of it goes down the drain and no wonder we can't write right because it's a [ __ ] coin flip and if the coin flips the wrong way it's over it's GG you're not a successful author what are you then a failure you are a failure and you just can't handle that right you can't handle being a failure and so now we understand okay of course like who would who wants to go all in on a coin flip can you do that especially when you're 40 when it's too late to learn something else when it's too late to Pivot into something else oh my goodness and so paradoxically the more we invest into something the more we view ourselves as an author the more that we strive for success in writing the harder it becomes to write and so then what we do we go optimizing all the things that we can we're going to learn this I'm going to do this podcast I'm going to take this course I'm gonna join this writing group I'm going to do all of the things around the periphery it except take the plunge so what do we do about this situation this is where once again it's going to be kind of simple also very difficult and remember that the more complex the answer is the easier it is for the mind the Mind loves complexity right that's how you're able to do all of the periphery because the mind tells you oh look being successful involves 15 variables and then the mind is it's thrilled because now I can do a I can do B I can do c I can do D I can do E I can do I can make all of this progress while staying perfectly still I can be paralyzed and progress at the same time right I can take another class I can do another podcast I can listen to this I can do all these things that will team me up for success with ever ever without ever having to take the plunge and the answer is quite simple and that is to recognize that you can't be a successful author the whole idea is false it's an idea of the ego of the ahamgar and now we see why there's so much comparison so y'all been paying attention and you know about a Home Guard you know that a humgar is a consequence of the comparison I mean a con comparison is a consequence of a home God because I want to be a successful author well what does that even mean what does it mean to be a successful author what does it mean to be a failure as an author is getting a book rejected mean that you're a successful author does getting a book accepted mean that you're a successful author because ultimately being an author is not about being it's not about something you are it is about what you do so this is where I think everyone who strives to be a successful author I don't know about everyone but many people who strive to be successful authors never become successful authors so how do you become a successful author you write right and then you do the next thing you write something you you're worried about sharing it with people sharing it with your family and whatnot and what if they think you're good enough or what if they think you're bad enough you're so concerned about the sharing and instead what you should be concerned about is the writing because the idea of being a successful author is an amalgamation of lots of different things and the problem is you can't do all of those things at once you could even say that part of being a successful author is dealing with rejection but the problem is that you can't deal with rejection because in your mind like that one rejection means so much for your future so you are tying the actions of today to a destiny of tomorrow and if you are tying the actions today to Destiny of tomorrow you can never act today because how could you just imagine for a moment if you made one choice today that would determine the rest of your life and furthermore if that choice was whether you become a successful author or not imagine how paralyzed you would be if you're unlucky you don't even have to imagine it you know you can't afford to make the choice that's what it comes down to and that's where you have to realize it's all false all of it is false all you can do is write all you can do is submit what you've written all you can do is go to a conference and find an agent all you can do is what you can do it's not your place to be successful or not successful this is a concept that I think is best explained in the bhagavad-gita which is a religious text from the Hindu tradition but there's this concept of Karma far Karma means action and father means fruit as a human being you are entitled only to your actions never to the fruit of your actions I can ask someone out but I'm not entitled to them saying yes I can write a book but I'm not entitled to publishing it and so now we understand why a whole generation of people is paralyzed because we get so caught up on controlling the one thing that is out of our control when I plant a seed in the ground and I try to grow a fruit tree does it grow or not grow I don't know that's not for me to decide all I can control is what I do so what can you do this is the answer forget about who you are forget about what you want to be you want to be a successful author well I have no [ __ ] idea if you can do that neither do you because who said you could see the future you can't see the future and yet you live your life as if you can you live your life looking for the formula that will guarantee you success and now we understand why you're paralyzed because what actions can you take that will guarantee success what do you have to do to be able to predict the future because if you can figure that out then you'll act and you stay paralyzed because you can't see in the future and you're looking for a guarantee and you fear failure so focus on the action don't write for anyone else don't write to become successful acknowledge that whether you are successful in this life or not is not yours to determine all you can do is give everything that you've got that's all you can do give it your all and what if it's not enough then it's not enough this is the wild thing if you want to be free of that there is a beautiful piece in giving everything what we've got in it not being enough we start with that being the ultimate fear because what what if I give it everything I've got and it's not enough that means that I'm not good enough because I gave it everything and if you really look at why we self-sabotage part of the reasons that we self-sabotage is to protect our ego because what we want is we want to reserve something right so if we're not top of the class we can say to ourselves oh well I half-assed it that's my excuse so we are terrified of the idea of giving it all and not being enough but there's something beautiful that we don't realize is when you give it your all and it's not enough it's liberating it's not crushing it's liberating you may say well how the hell does that happen well because I gave it my all and I know there's not a damn thing I could have done so it isn't my fault I did everything that I was supposed to do and Medicine teaches you this when you try to save a life and you can't doesn't matter that you trained at Harvard or not doesn't matter you can do whatever you want to you can call consults you can call the chief of Psychiatry the number one Hospital in the United States and you can ask for their help and it's still not enough you can do everything that you want to do and then you begin to realize how humble you truly are it humbles you because you can't control life all of this training all of this power all of this medical technology and I do not have the power over life or death obviously and it's liberating because then what I'm going to give it everything that I've got if it doesn't work out it doesn't work out so don't try to live a life of success try to live a life Without Regrets give it everything you've gotten if it's not enough that ain't on you right if you're just too damn stupid to write successfully or the market doesn't want what you want that's actually totally okay because you gave it everything you've got you controlled everything on your side of the equation so focus on the action if you want to write write don't worry about whether people will like it or not like it that's not what writing is about write the story that's in here write the story that you want to tell and you're going to write that story and you're going to look at it and you're going to say this is trash so be it you're going to stick it in the dust drawer you're going to walk away for a month you're going to come back you're going to pull it out you're going to read it and it's absolute trash and you're going to make it a little bit better you're going to take that chicken [ __ ] and one step at a time you're going to turn it in a chicken salad you make your first edit we're going to toss in a little bit of mayo second edit toss in a little bit of salt a little bit of pepper it's edible now but it's nowhere near where you know it can be then we're going to add some pickles add a little bit of celery add some cayenne now it's looking pretty good and the Greeks understood this really well because they talked about genius which is not that the skill of the rider exists within you you are not a genius genius is something that happens to you it's An Occurrence it's an RNG event and the beautiful thing about that perspective is that it removes ego from the equation it assumes that you are not responsible for the success or the failure and so recognize that all you can do is what you can do and if it's not good enough it's not good enough you ain't you can't predict the the future how on Earth do you know if it's good enough or not good enough you're afraid it won't be good enough set that fear aside acknowledge it set it aside and start to write
