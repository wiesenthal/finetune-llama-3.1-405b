and that's where I stumbled upon something that I think is really really amazing and it's actually like helped me a ton which is intermittent fasting for technology here at HG we help people develop healthy relationships with technology and this is becoming increasingly important because as we're sort of getting more and more research on stuff we're discovering that there are negative impacts to social media and the more time we spend playing video games like the more sort of impacts our motivation we're also sort of seeing some problems develop with things like streaming and parasocial relationships stuff like pornography addiction and so while technology has a lot of really great uses in our life it also causes us a lot of problems hey there thanks for watching and I'm glad these videos have been helpful a lot of times I'll read the comments and see people asking well what do I actually do about it which is such a great question and unfortunately my experience has been that the resources out there aren't actually that good at helping people create sustainable change which is why I started HG in the first place he coaches are trained on a curriculum that integrates all of my understanding into what is motivation what paralyzes Us and how to create lasting behavioral change so if you're ready to take the next step he coaches are ready to build the life that you want they've helped people build careers find relationships build networks of friends discover what their passions are and pursue their Hobbies so if this sounds like something that you'd be interested in check out the link in the description below and so some people will come up with things and we do this in our community as well where we've got like a particular coach for example who runs these like dopamine detox sessions we have all kinds of like limitation attempts at technology but the challenge is that it's really hard right let's say I do a dopamine fast for two weeks and then like I come back to it and then it's sort of like okay well how do I reintegrate technology we'll see this also with stuff like things like pornography addiction or video game addiction more so with video game addiction but like how do we sort of reintegrate this technology if we take an extended break from it right so people will take these breaks but then the questions that I always get is like okay what's the right amount of technology to use because it's really hard because even if you work really hard and you sort of take a big break from technology you've got to come back at some point right because technology is a part of every part of our life it's part of work it's part of it's how we have fun it's how we socialize so we don't spend time on screens but I'm still needing to like text people to make plans and stuff like that so it's in every corner of our life and it becomes really hard to not let it bleed in and that's there's a very good reason why it's hard to let it not bleed in it's because the developers of things like apps and various technology platforms want to bleed into our life right that's the way they design stuff so they design stuff with different kinds of colors and if you take a look at any icon on your phone I can guarantee you that that icon has been extensively tested even things like the pitch and tone and frequency and volume of notifications on your phone are designed to kind of pull you in and that's the huge problem with tech is that I have a lot of good legitimate reasons to use it right like I've got to check my email for work I've got to get back to this person so we can meet up for dinner or whatever I need to coordinate with my personal trainer so I can get physically in shape I need to look up a recipe so that I can make myself a healthy dinner there's all these like healthy uses of tech the problem arises that the second we start using the device there's all this stuff out there that is pulling us in a different direction because once I look at one recipe like you know whatever platform I'm using to look up the recipe doesn't want me to go because the longer I stay on the platform the more money the platform maker makes so they design lots of things they show you other things and those thumbnails are actually very carefully chosen the titles are carefully Chosen and we click on the next thing and we click on the next thing we click on the next thing so in the past when people develop solutions for technology there's one core problem and that core problem is okay how do I reintegrate it right if I take a vacation for two weeks or do a dopamine detox or dopamine fast and I'm gonna go be like doing all this different stuff how do I reintegrate it and that's where I stumbled upon something that I think is really really amazing and it's actually like helped me a ton which is intermittent fasting for technology so I was trying intermittent fasting in my own life because I'm trying to you know experiment with different diets and try to understand okay like what's healthy what's not healthy and so I tried intermittent fasting I thought it was like really really interesting so I I liked it a lot for a lot of reasons and then I kept on getting these questions from our community it's like okay I've done a dopamine detox for two weeks like now what do I do how do I develop healthy technology habits I'll get this question from parents as well like how much screen time is too much screen time and like all this kind of stuff and then I thought to myself well what if we just took all the principles of intermittent fasting and applied them to Tech what if we restricted our technology use to eight hours a day because I think that solves automatically a lot of problems so I decided to actually try it so for about a two now it's been almost three week period i implemented intermittent fasting for technology and what does that mean that means that I restrict all of my Technologies to eight hours a day and you may say to yourself but hold on a second like how is that possible like how are you going to have fun right because like if I say something like that what's your initial reaction I can't restrict technology usage to eight hours a day so you really can't do that right because I have to work for eight hours and work requires technology right and if I have to work for technology that means that my entertainment will become Amish like I can't do anything fun using a screen you mean I can't watch movies I can't watch TV I can't play videos I can't do any of that stuff what if I need to look up a recipe then what so it sounds impossible but this is where actually it's like really really fantastic and it is way more manageable than you could possibly imagine so let's try to understand a little bit how this works so as I started to implement a technology restriction to eight hours a day I noticed it solved a lot of the problems that I try to help people with so with like a dopamine detox okay how do I reintegrate it it's kind of fixed because you can only use it for eight hours a day you don't have to worry about it invading every corner of your life in terms of stuff like video games like how much is too much well that depends like if you've got time for it and you finish everything that you need to do then you can play video games and by the way I've been gaming a fair amount during this time it's like actually not that big of a deal it's bizarre and then there's also another huge thing that I kind of discovered which is that everyone is like out of time nowadays right like everyone's like oh my God like I go to work I commute like I cook I exercise and that's all the time I have in the day like I don't have time for anything right it's just like work eat sleeps rinse and repeat cycle which makes sense right that's the experience that a lot of people have and it's like oh my God like what's the problem it's like it's capitalism right and like people are working me harder and I work so much and all this kind of stuff and I'm not saying that people don't do that right so that's definitely the case but I think there are some things that we've missed so let's start by understanding how many hours we actually have in a week there's about 168 hours in a week let's assume that we sleep for eight hours a day so that drops us down by 56 hours a week down to 112. Let's assume that we work for about 40 hours a week that drops us down to about 72 and then let's also assume that there's 10 hours of other miscellaneous work a week I was actually checking myself and I tend to work a little bit more than 40 hours um also you got to like go grocery shopping and stuff like that so let's give that another 10 hours a week okay so now we're left with 62 hours after we include work and sleeping so first thing that I want you all to notice is like we still have a lot of time left in the week but let's add a couple of other things so let's assume that we spend about one hour a day like cooking and cleaning right so that moves us down from 62 to about 55. let's say I spend about half an hour getting ready every morning with like showering shaving and all that kind of stuff so that's an additional 3.5 hours so we're down to about 52 hours a week and let's say that we want to exercise an hour a day right which who exercises an hour a day so even if we're left at like 52 hours if we're gonna exercise for an hour a day we're down to like 45 hours which is a lot it doesn't sound like once we include cooking cleaning work overflow work com like maybe if you want to add commute you can add that let's say half an hour each way which is seven hours a week right so one hour a day so now we're like maybe in the 30s it doesn't feel like we have 35 to 40 free hours a week and you're correct you don't have 45 40 to 45 hours a week where does that time go well it turns out that the average human being spends about four hours a day on their cell phone right and it's not necessarily productive work so that's like 28 hours right there and that doesn't even include the seven hours a day that we normally spend on screens on average okay and if you're watching this your usage may even be a little bit higher because you're a member of this community and you're watching this on a platform right now so once we include seven hours a week of screen time like okay now we're talking about 49 additional hours that's total screen time or computer usage actually now we can sort of see what what's happening right because we don't have 50 extra hours a week well so this is what's really cool is when I started doing intermittent fasting for technology I actually gained about 40 hours a week it's like absolutely wild because where does that time go like think about it right if you work 40 or 50 hours a week you sleep 56 hours a week you cook you clean you exercise a little bit like you're not left with 40 hours a week where does it go it goes into technology that's why everyone is like I don't have any time anymore well how many hours a day do you spend on cell phones and screens and what are you even doing during that time so here's what I noticed once I actually started restricting to eight hours a day the first thing that I noticed is that in the mornings I waste a lot of time on technology and I'll sort of justify it to myself thinking about work so I'll like like I'll you know I'll start early in the morning like and sometimes I'll wake up and do yoga and stuff but on a bad day I'll pull up my phone and the first thing that I do is I check my calendar and I see like okay what do I need to do today like what time do I need to get up how many hours do I have to be a degenerate before work starts and you may do the same thing and then what happens you start thinking about the stuff that you have to do but you don't actually do it right so I spend time like checking my Calendar checking my email and mentally making a list of tasks that I need to do that day then depending on how many hours I have to be a degenerate I may like browse Reddit and if I'm browsing Reddit for like half an hour 45 minutes every trip to the bathroom I'm taking my cell phone means that taking a piss instead of taking 30 seconds takes 10 minutes right and then like when I read when I'm looking stuff on Reddit like oh I'm going to keep up with some drama I'm going to maybe like look at a scientific study here they're like you know but most of the time I'm going to be looking at how the world is all going to hell and no one can meet anyone and everyone's lonely and there's suicide and there's war and there's inflation and so now I've lost an hour of my day maybe even 75 minutes and what have I accomplished all I've done is stress myself out for the day I've got a bunch of crap but did I actually do it no I just like looked at what I have to do it's like when I'm staring at like a a book and just not reading it right it's a complete waste of time so the other challenge that I had is oh my God like what if I need to get all this stuff done eight hours is not enough work is not enough time to get all my work done so I started freaking out so then I did something really cool so I held that boundary and then I started realizing oh I can work a lot without technology so then what I started doing is like sitting down with a piece of paper and I would like write out like everything I need to do today I'd make shopping lists I'd like you know figure out okay what are the tasks that I need to do I'd think about what my priorities are at work before being prompted by something like calendar or email so paradoxically what started happening is I started focusing on like bigger picture stuff and more important stuff all the crap that I should be doing that I don't have time to do because I'm getting bogged down in meetings I'm actually starting today thinking about that stuff so this is what my day used to look like I'd come into this office I'd sit down at this computer and I'd basically try to figure out like okay what am I gonna do today and now what my day looks like now this is not something that I really expected is this okay so I use so much more paper than I did before and what I basically will do is like sit down and I'll try to like kind of map out what my day actually looks like I'll take a ton of notes of all different kinds here's actually here's the pile of papers just from the last 24 hours um and what I've really found is that it focuses me so much more and that's when it kind of hit me that like you know usually we sit down to use a device and we don't really know why we're using it and the more that devices can do multiple things the easier it is to not know why you're using it when you sit down so when I sit down now at my computer it's like what am I actually trying to do like okay well I can do some work I can play some games I can check my email I can pay some bills there's like a thousand different things that I can do on my on my computer or my phone which means that when I sit down to use it my mind is not focused and if my mind is not focused that means that it's way easier to get distracted right and that's what all these apps and like YouTube suggestions and like Reddit posts like that's what they're there for they're there to distract the mind and what I've discovered now is since I've started limiting my technology use and I actually like map out like what I need to do today before I I actually even like get started when I sit down to use a device what I actually discover is I know exactly what I'm doing so I sit down and I'm like okay I've got a limited number of times so I got to do this this this this and this and then my mind is really focused and I find that I don't get distracted and I actually find that like eight hours of Technology use a day is actually way more than enough which I never realized until I actually sat down and started doing this then I break my my technology fast right so I tend to start my window was 10 a.m to 6 p.m right so I'm not touching anything on a screen until 10 A.M so let's all like do yoga and other crap like that and then I like break my fast and then what I found is when I actually use the technology I'm incredibly focused so I have a shopping list so if I would need to get stuff from Amazon or whatever I just log on I type in the things I have in the cart and I check out and if you think about like why is shopping hard why does shopping take any more than 60 or 90 or three minutes five minutes it's because we browse and when we browse we buy crap we don't need and why do we buy it because we browse and we're looking for crap that we don't even need and that's how the website is designed right and I'm not saying that Amazon is evil it's just how the whole internet is designed the whole internet is designed for you to come in for one purpose and then for you to hang out for three hours doing crap that you don't need to do but if I only have eight hours of Technologies I can't afford to spend half an hour wasting my time browsing crap that I don't need the other thing that I found is that my work became incredibly focused so I do a fair amount of writing and what I would do is sit down and like write everything out this is my pile of papers from stuff that I I do one thing I found is that I also print out a lot of stuff so since I'm not allowed to use technology I'll start work before 10 but I don't break my technology fast so I'll like print things out that's the one real downside I guess it's bad for the environment so I'll print stuff out and I'll like look over it I'll collect all my thoughts and then when I sit down to write instead of writing for an hour and a half that's a stream of Consciousness that has to be edited later I have all my thoughts collected I write for like 20 minutes and I'm done it's really bizarre even when it comes to like meetings and stuff like that I'm really focused I know what I need to do I've thought about everything I'm not getting distracted by stuff I do absolutely check my email and then I add other things to the list that I need to take care of but I want you all to think about this I don't know if you all have ever had to work on the same day that you're catching a flight and so this is the kind of thing where if you have to leave work by like 1 pm to catch your flight what do you do when you get to work you're incredibly focused right I got to do this this and this because I got to be out the door at 1 pm I don't have any time to waste and so you don't waste any time and you're out by 1 pm and the world doesn't fall apart this is what every day has turned into like my work is incredibly focused I shop quickly and I'm done the really bizarre thing that I discovered is remember my window is 10 to 6 but I'll start work before because I would sometimes finish work early like I'd finished work around like 3 30 or 4 like finish my last meeting and then I'd play video games for like an hour or two until 6 pm and then once 6 PM rolls around like then it's like okay my technology window is closed so that means I gotta do something else like spend time with my kids or go outside or go for a walk or read a book and this is what's really wild is like I don't know if you all realize this you you know how long it takes to read a book the average book is 80 000 words okay the average human reads at the pace of 300 words a minute which means that the average person can finish the average book in six hours and we have 40 hours a week of free time and we've already accounted for cooking cleaning exercise errands and crap like that so I read four books in two weeks because I don't have anything else to do it was actually really great I also started like gardening and other crap like that like I just started doing all the stuff that is on your to-do list that you don't have time to do and why don't you have time to do it it's because you spend four hours a day on your cell phone and seven hours a day on a screen and only some of it is work but the thing is work doesn't have to fill out eight hours this is the other wild thing the average person spends eight hours at work but they really only do between three and six hours of productive work a day and you know this right most of what you do at work is getting distracted and then eventually you'll do some work so what would happen if we started making everything efficient this is what intermittent fasting for technology has helped me do make everything efficient so let's talk a little bit about how to make this happen what we're going to do for if for technology is actually pull from a lot of like intermittent fasting principles from like Diet stuff okay so the first thing that's really important is you've got to plan your day just like you plan your meals in an intermittent fasting if you do not plan your meals in if you will fail so you really have to think ahead of time about what you're gonna eat when you break your fast and like what's gonna happen in the same way you have to think ahead of time about how you are going to deploy The Limited resource of Technology and this in and of itself cuts out so much of the waste right because if I don't get this done I can't do it and if you violate that then you're SOL so let's start by just thinking through okay what do I need to do so this is what I need to do for work this is why I need to order stuff online this is the stuff that like I need to check into here's the doctor's appointment that I need to investigate things like that the second thing that we we really need to be prepared for is when I was learning in intermittent fasting I learned something really interesting which is that you're going to need to change your relationship with hunger in the same way if you're doing if for technology you need to change your relationship with boredom so right now the way that we exist is when we get bored we have some dopaminergic crap that we reach for that doesn't really fulfill us and doesn't help us doesn't isn't actually making us fun it just alleviates boredom for some amount of time and it even can get to the point where we are so it doesn't even do a good job of alleviating boredom so we need a second device I don't know if you all like if this applies to you but when you're watching TV and scrolling on your phone at the same time so if you're hitting that point then that's a huge problem so for these two weeks prepared to be like a little bit bored and the key thing to understand is that border man gonna kill you and it's like okay to be born and just think a little bit about okay like what's more important to me gaining 40 hours a week or being less bored like that's literally what the trade-off is because what we're doing every time we satisfy our boredom is we're losing an hour of our life every week okay so change your relationship with boredom understand that just like hunger it's a sensation it's a concern it's a worry and there's all kinds of stuff that you can do that may not quite fix it this is where I found that originally for me like going for walks was really really important so I'd go for a walk I'd take papers I'd take a book and I'd sit down at a park bench and actually like do my work there or think or do some kind of recreation okay so we're about one week in into intermittent fasting for technology and the experience has been really interesting so the first thing that I kind of noticed is like how much time I waste on technology and being able to really like restrict technology usage to eight hours a day has completely changed the structure of my day-to-day the first thing is like I'm working right now and this is where I spend I try to spend at least one hour a day outdoors and what I found is that actually instead of just like waking up in the morning and like sitting down at the computer and figuring out what I need to do for the day which is usually what used to happen I would sit down like look at my calendar and like you know just try to figure out check my email check slack check Reddit and like I used to just spend an hour or two just like checking stuff without actually doing work and what I found now is that what I'll usually do is since I don't want to break my fast I'll come outside with a piece of like paper and a pen and I'll actually just think a little bit about okay what do I want to accomplish today like what do I need to do and so rather than having like the internet or technology prompt me about what's important I start to spend time really like thinking about okay like this is what I need to accomplish today is there a couple of other caveats which I had to sort of think about which I didn't really think about ahead of time until I tried it so you'll probably have to do this too the first is when I refer to technology what I usually mean is electronics so in my case like I had a couple of simple exceptions so like I'm allowed to use a car and like a microwave and things like that like I'm allowed to like use things that are technological devices okay I'm allowed to use a yoyo if I really need to Tech even though it's like you know technically technology the other thing is I let myself use GPS and then I let myself use a phone to coordinate like social plans and stuff so for example if my kids are going to like you know their friend's house for dinner like I'm allowed to text their parents to go pick them up the key thing there is that once I start using my phone I'm going to be really really strict about okay like I'm only gonna text them and I'm only going to take phone calls and stuff the other thing which I unfortunately had to do is since I'm a practicing physician stuff relating to patients like was the exception here so if I get like a call from a patient and the patient is like hey I've run out of this medication can you please call in you know some kind of refill or something like that or I need like I got a brain scan or I what happened this week is someone called me because they needed me to like look at their EKG and things like that this is more Physical Medicine stuff but like that was kind of the big rule breaker that I sort of allowed for myself so if a patient needs me to use technology after hours like it's totally okay to use it so you may figure out a couple of things that are like exceptions to your rule which is totally fine but I strongly strongly strongly urge you to try to restrict as many things as you can and so let me give you all a couple of examples of things that I struggled with so one question is what about music and what about audiobooks so usually I'm someone who really likes listening to audiobooks when I'm doing things like the dishes and so oddly enough what I sort of decided was that I was actually going to cut both of them so no audio books except within the window and then like no music originally I allowed myself to listen to music if I'm doing like stuff that is not otherwise technology related so if I'm reading a book and I'm you know sitting with my kids and we're like playing like you know there's music on the background that's totally fine so you may discover that there are a couple of exceptions and you've got to kind of figure that out for yourself so just to summarize right now we all struggle with not having enough time there's also this really simple question of how do I use technology in a healthy way and so far the approach that we've taken is to try to like cut it out entirely right but the moment that we start getting back into it it's very hard to set limits on our technology because we're using it for like a quote unquote good reason right so like maybe I'm I need it for work which is like kind of number one like I use it to communicate with family members I use it to do research that's another thing I stopped doing like stupid ass random research that never turned into anything like if I sat down I would do research but then I would like turn it into something that was a big thing that I kind of discovered is that like there's so much unproductive work that you do at work and so if you have to restrict your technology usage you're just gonna like sit down and actually get it done there are a couple of core problems that people are dealing with today number one they don't know how to use their technology in a healthy way right we sort of will try to restrict it we'll sometimes even go to drastic lengths almost like a crash diet where I'm going to cut out all technology for two weeks and we've advocated for this at times we sort of have groups of people who do this on Discord we have coaches who will help people with things like you know building healthy technology habits and so that's all really great the real challenge is that even if we try to set a healthy limit something is going to get in the way we need to work and once we start working this is where there's like billion dollar companies out there that are trying to steal your attention away from work and then we end up slipping into technology the second thing that we've observed across the whole is if you talk to people no one has time right everyone's running out of time there's too much to do I've got to work so much and I'm what this is life it's a get up go to work finish work commute home exercise do laundry eat and go to sleep after half an hour of recreation that's what it feels like right but what I think a lot of people are missing is literally if you do an hour calculation in the day we still have about 40 hours left in the in a week where does that time go well it turns out there's statistics for that four hours a day of cell phone usage six hours and 45 minutes a day of other kinds of screen time and so that's where our time is going so it's a really simple solution which is restrict all of your technology usage to eight hours a day and you may start to Rebel oh my God but what about this but what about this but what about this but what about this and that's exactly what we want you to do we want you to think about all of those problems and then solve them within the space that you have right because our attention and Technology usage is kind of like a gas it fills up what whatever container we give it and the more that you start restricting it to eight hours a day the more you'll figure out okay I can actually be incredibly efficient even though I'm breaking my fast at 10 A.M I can start work two hours earlier and if I start work two hours earlier when I sit down at the computer I bang stuff out way faster and I still have time for recreation by the way I still get eight hours on the weekend and what do you think I do on those eight hours on the weekend I may not start in the morning I may start at 2 pm right or even 3 P.M or 4 P.M and then I'm putting my kids to bed they're in bed by let's say nine and then like I have three hours to game so you can absolutely do that and it's kind of an intentional thing but once those three hours over you're done and so it's time to go to bed so I strongly encourage you all to think about intermittent fasting for technology I think it's a very very elegant solution to a lot of the problems that we face and you'll be amazed at like how much time you have once you start to implement it all that crap that you wish you would do like read a book which by the way takes five hours did you realize that the average human being can read a book in five to six hours we spend one book's worth of time on our cell phones every single day so you'll find that you have a lot more time to do the things that are actually important to you and that actually like leads to a way better life so definitely give it a shot and feel free to add your experience in the
