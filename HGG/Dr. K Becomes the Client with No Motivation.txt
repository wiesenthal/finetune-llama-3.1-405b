usually what happens with this kind of situation is we use pressure we use shame all these other things as negative motivation in our lives and the reason we use negative motivation is because it works because it's easy so i'm going to go ahead and move to the interview screen so they'll be able to see you so everyone say hello to sidekick i don't have chat open that's fine it will not be good for my focus yeah good it's not good for my focus as well so um sidekick your understanding is that uh um so we're going to be doing let's try to get through like three okay so we're gonna do three role plays um the scenarios that we're gonna [Music] actually you know if you don't know what the scenarios are we're not going to tell you which ones we picked okay okay so let's go ahead and start okay i'm going to skip all the normal intro stuff for time's sake sounds good yeah uh so what brings you into healthy gamer um so i've been watching uh streams and youtube for a little while and i'm just kind of stuck um and i learned so much from that i decided i'd kind of give coaching a shot okay what uh what do you mean you feel stuck well like i know there's a lot of stuff that i should be doing um and i just can't do it like i think i'm i'm low i've also seen a lot of stuff on like five factor personality um i've watched a lot of jordan peterson stuff uh i think i'm i'm kind of low on the conscientiousness and so like i just can't put my mind to things so you're stuck in the sense of like it's hard for you to focus on stuff uh yeah i mean i can focus on some things but i really like struggle in other areas i'd say it's like more of like a motivational thing like if i get interested in something i can focus really really well the problem is that i know that there's stuff that i should do that i'm just not motivated okay by the way if you ever see me looking this way that's where i take notes okay so what kind of notes are you taking just talking points things that i might want to keep in mind or come back to it helps me to look for patterns and stuff that we talk about and then if i see a pattern i can mention it to you and then you can tell me if that pattern's real or not wow that's actually really interesting yeah so um you said you watched dr k you said you watched jordan peterson um what kind of like patterns what stuff resonates with you when you watch that kind of content well i mean i i think that like like i said i i you know so i know i'm capable of a lot i just can't really bring myself to do it and what i really liked about that stuff is like i've always been really i feel like there's been a lot of judgment from my parents from even my friends and stuff and like even kind of from myself and what i kind of realized is that i just kept beating myself up for like not being able to do stuff and that was actually kind of working it's kind of weird like sometimes you know when i get really frustrated with myself i'll get this burst of motivation or like you know two days before the test i'll finally like crack and i'll start studying really really really hard um but then even afterward i just feel i don't know like i i know if i had started a few days earlier like i just know i could do better okay it sounds like when you get stuck it's like there's this barrier in your way and then you have to build up enough like pressure to break it or overcome it yeah i mean the way that i've understood it is that since i have low conscientiousness like there's something about you know something builds up and sometimes like i can motivate myself but i think the problem is that you know i've got this like you know as kind of born with this low conscientiousness okay can you define what you mean by that for me well like there are two kinds of people right so there's people who are like intrinsically motivated and when they put their mind to something they can do it and then like people with low conscientiousness aren't like that so i don't know if you're kind of familiar with this area of research but there are five dimensions of personality and one of the dimensions is conscientiousness and it's it's kind of like a scientific fact that they're like two groups of people there's like disciplined people and there's lazy people okay and from the way you're describing it it sounds like that's like a fixed quality well i mean yeah i mean it's like it's scientific okay have you ever uh studied anything about fixed or growth mindsets no i mean i know mindset is important sure um so uh just just so you're aware i have my backgrounds as a teacher i taught for about eight years interesting the way i run coaching sessions a lot of times i end up teaching people things and then we kind of wrap that back around into whatever they want to talk about so one of the things i'd like to teach you today is about growth versus fixed mindsets if you're okay with that yeah i mean if you think it'll be helpful yeah so the idea of growth versus fixed mindset is understanding like growth as in the capability of becoming something different of growing of changing fixed being more static isolated this just is the way it is kind of thing okay what happens with a growth mindset is you're able to kind of take criticism and use that as motivation to change something what happens with fixed mindsets is when that criticism comes in you view it as a static fact that you're not good enough and from what i'm hearing from a lot of the things you're saying it sounds very much like you're in that fixed mindset place does that sound true to you well i mean sort of but like isn't it i mean all this research about conscientiousness is kind of true right like it's true in the sense that like personality theory is like really a sociological study so it's more about trends than about hard facts okay i'm sorry i didn't quite follow that can you explain that a little bit yeah so for example they might say something like oh like the average person has this much of a conscientiousness score but there's so many other variables that play into that and how that person would act on any individual day based on their own past experiences so a lot of times those things break into like 70 30 categories and you might be in the 70 or you might be in the 30 but it doesn't mean like you're hard committed to that thing so if 70 of people who do this thing are conscientious you might be in the 30 where you're still conscientious but you don't do that thing oh that's kind of interesting so i guess what you're saying is that a lot of this personality stuff is like population based kind of yeah yeah it's more like kind of widespread statistics okay as opposed to applying directly to one individual and and you were saying that you think i have like a fixed mindset yeah so the idea of a fixed mindset is is very static right so for example what you're saying is like there's two kinds of people there's people who are born with this intrinsic motivation and people who aren't and you feel like you're in that knot category yeah and the real question is like between growth is do you feel you can change that well that's interesting because i you know my my first thought is like hold on a second i i gotta like pro like this is interesting because i mean i was about to say i think you're debating me a little bit because like if i were to say i can't change then you're going to say well that's the fixed mindset sure and and it's interesting i mean i guess because you're also calling it a mindset right which means like logically it should be like changeable yeah but there could be like different things in the way of that happening easier or not yeah i mean i guess i can change i mean that's why i'm here because i i think that like i've seen people change um you know i've seen a lot of people in this community change and talk about how much they've changed so i'm kind of like open to that is is that something that you can you help me like adopt a growth mindset yeah we can totally do that cool so uh basically the way this starts and like i understand the feeling of being debated in that and that kind of situation coaching works like a choose your own adventure so it there's not like a right answer to any of my questions we're gonna talk about whatever's in the way for any of these things so if we're talking about a fixed versus growth mindset and you ended up in the fixed side that's fine we would just start there we would start on whatever page that is and then move on down the choose your adventure path and then the same thing here where you say i do want to change i do think it's possible well great now we're now we're going to start there we're going to start with what do you want to change so what do you want to change i i want to be able to like motivate myself better like i want to be able to do the things that i know i should do so it's the i think second or third time you've used the idea of should where does that come from for you like why should you do that i mean because like look i'm 23. um i graduated a little over a year ago i still don't have a job right like i mean i should i should be moving out of my parents place i should be financially independent like i don't know i kind of feel like that's i mean isn't that just what we're suppo like we're all supposed to do something you know like it's kind of you know it's kind of weird to be like where i like isn't where i'm supposed to be yeah but for you like where are those shits coming from like who told you that that's a rule about life i i don't really know i've never really thought about that i mean i just you know it's just i mean like so first thing is like you know my parents are every month or not even every month i mean it used to be every day like they'd ask me like hey how's the job search going how's the job search going i don't think they get that it's hard like kovit has screwed the economy like you know there's some jobs out there but they pay so low that it's not it's gonna just destroy my mental and like not even gonna help me move towards my goals um you know the jobs that i want like i'm kind of a long shot for um you know part of the issue is that my major i was really excited about one thing but like i think i want to kind of like make a career shift and and so there's just a lot of stuff that like you know it just sometimes feels impossible and like my parents are kind of like constantly reminding me you know like when is this happening when is this happening when is this happening and then they're also saying stuff like you know you know you can stay as long as you want to but like you know but you know yep always there yeah yeah so you know sometimes it's it's it's hard no for sure all of that sounds like honestly just a lot of pressure yeah i mean it's you know i and and this is the kind of thing where like it it actually really does feel that way i mean i i feel like i'm under so much pressure and i know that other people like you know when you feel pressure it's like you can you know that pressure moves you and even for me it's move me like it's like when the you know my my calculus finals is coming up in like three days like that moves me some things change though where like the pressure doesn't seem to be working anymore sure yeah so it sounds like that pressure used to be your main motivator and now it's kind of stalled out yeah that's a great way to put it actually and so like now i don't know what to do because like my engine's stalling what if you didn't have to do all these things i mean i i guess that'd be great right i could do what i want what do you want damn um not to be like this anymore you know i i have passions um i've i've interests i have hobbies but like i can't you know even when i like think about doing those things like there's just so much more important stuff to do um i wish i didn't you know i wish i had like won the lottery i wish i was like born rich i wish i could like actually do what i want to in life as opposed to like needing to do all these things but i just i don't know how to get started so it sounds like all of these things like that create this pressure from from you from your family from your friends from society it's created so much pressure that now you can't move and there are things that you want to do there are things that you want to get out there and be a part of and progress in life and all of that but you're paralyzed yeah i mean is that something you yeah i mean i never really thought about it that way but you know you're kind of almost making it sound like it's not my fault do you feel like it is your fault well i mean yeah i mean like it's i'm the one responsible right like i'm the one who wakes up in the morning and like you know plays games until 1pm and then like tries to apply for a couple of jobs and then like plays games until midnight so i mean clearly it's my fault right like who else's fault is it gonna be that's a lot to put on yourself i mean but isn't it true to put all the pressures of society and like it's your fault are you saying it's society's fault i'm actually a big fan of saying it's no one's fault how how does that work well essentially when we talk about fault we're talking about blame and blame doesn't help us blame lets us discharge anger or frustration or hurt it doesn't actually help us move forward so whose fault something is doesn't actually help you deal with the fact that that's still a problem in your life wow i've never really thought about it that way teach me more yeah yeah this is my favorite part of coaching so um let's go back to the pressure idea we've talked about all this pressure it all exists all this stuff um i'm gonna kind of throw some generalities out there please correct me if any of these don't apply to you but usually what happens with this kind of situation is we use pressure we use shame all these other things as negative motivation in our lives and the reason we use negative motivation is because it works because it's easy right it's like getting fast food on the way home like it works and it's easy we all know it's unhealthy but we do it anyway right so we use this negative motivation as a way to get ourselves to do things whether it's study for a test apply for a job talk to a girl doesn't matter any of the things right so when we use that negative motivation the actual problem with it the reason we call it negative motivation is that it builds up these negative emotions within us and then we build up tolerance or avoidance to those emotions as humans our natural instinct is to avoid things that are uncomfortable so i don't want to go near my shame shame feels bad i'm going to go over here instead i'm going to go play a game i'm going to go see a movie i'm going to do whatever else right and so as you build up this tolerance to your pressure your negative motivation you need more and more pressure or negative motivation to overcome it huh interesting so by now i feel like it's you yeah i mean it feels like every time i have to that's so interesting like every time i feel like it takes more to get me to motivate myself like true you know because like the urgency has to be like bigger and bigger and bigger and at some point it almost feels like too overwhelming and then like i just don't know how to start yeah i think if i was going to take a guess here part of the reason you don't know how to start is because all of that pressure turns into expectation for how the thing is gonna end before you've even taken step one okay i'm i'm kind of confused what what do you mean by that what do you have all this pressure on yourself about finding a job being independent moving out all these other things what happens is those turn into expectations you expect yourself to do it you think your parents expect you to do it whether that's overtly displayed or kind of passively displayed or whatever it might be and then now we're looking at the result of you getting a job and moving out as a you must do that it's an expectation but isn't that i mean how else am i supposed to know what to do like so it's not that you can't move that direction it's again that if that is what you're evaluating yourself on is have i already moved out have i already gotten a job i've already done all those things well right now you haven't so right now it's going to go back to that negative emotion it's going to go back to shame it's going to go back to pressure so how do i change that we have to flip it so that you're working on where you are now not working on where you want to be that sounds great yeah how do i flip it way better so the the first step for this is like it's a really simple trick and people this is another debated thing people never believe me when i tell them it's this easy you have to be already good enough well the example i always use for this is like job interviews right so in a job interview people oftentimes view that as i'm going to the job interview so they can tell me if i'm good enough for that job or not and that's actually the wrong way to look at it because you're letting that person and the result of that interview judge you but wait when you go in sorry go ahead but like i mean isn't that exactly the point of a job interview to see if you're good enough for the job how does that how does that work bro the job interview is the opportunity for the interviewer to see that you are good enough you're already good enough they might see it and they might not this is where we get back to mindset it's your mindset going into the interview are you good enough or are you going to let that person tell you whether or not you're good enough but like how do i know if i'm good enough that's where we start working because this is some crazy stuff man we're gonna loop it all in trust me so you said you know you're capable but you can't do it right you said there's a lot of judgment i see what you're doing you're looking at the notes i said i just write over there yeah so and then the whole two kinds of people think the people who get it done and the people who don't right again that's results based right so when you're looking at yourself because these things don't exist yet they can one day we're gonna talk about yet another coaching session but because they don't exist yet you're judging yourself as not good enough before you even get there wait i'm i'm kind of so so it's i if are you kind of saying but like isn't whether you're good enough isn't that what determines whether you get there no you're good enough whether you get there or not that's fair enough right now here today how can you say that you just met me sure but i already know that you're good enough you don't know anything about me do i need to know more well i mean like don't you like i'm so confused like what do you mean i'm good enough so this is kind of the issue with judgment is that a lot of times we use it as results based the reason why it's easy for me to say you're good enough today is because i'm not going to use any judgment when i make that decision but isn't that what good enough means isn't it good enough judgment good enough is judgment when you kind of let the results impact whether or not you feel good enough so you're saying it's like about how i feel about myself yep just like the growth versus fixed mindset i'm confused so so are you saying that whether i'm good enough doesn't have to do with whether i get the job or not correct okay let's pause for a second fantastic job sidekick how did it feel for you good uh still a little a little nervous but i'm okay um so a couple of things i just want to point out so i i've never i don't i don't know if i've ever seen you coach before uh not since training okay so first of all i really um want to just like i i didn't i mean i know you're good right so we get feedback um i hear about some of the clients that you work with in case review and and things like that so i i know how thoughtful you are um i also understand you run office hours or case review or or something at times right i did it for one of the new cohorts okay i run the social sandbox thing in the main discord okay so you've you've stepped into a teaching role um in a couple places which we totally you know understand i mean i know i get because we have we know you're good um uh but uh what i really want to say is i i really appreciate and just for people who are watching uh how much you actually teach so a couple of things for people to understand not every coach teaches as much as sidekick does and that's actually okay so part of what we really appreciate is that each coach has particular strengths and weaknesses but um i think that you do a really good job of like introducing some of these concepts and i don't know that as the client i fully understood what you were saying because the concepts are just so foreign to the way that i've been thinking my entire life right sure so some of some of the things you did a really good job of i felt myself breaking apart in terms of like my beliefs about the world i didn't find myself believing what you were saying yet it was more confusing than anything else but i i think actually what you did very fast which is actually very very good is that a lot of times what holds people back and and hopefully people who are understanding i know you understand this so i'm sort of more saying this to chat and stuff is that it's our conceptions of ourself right it's the idea that when i go into the job interview i'm trying to prove something instead of believing hey like i actually bring something to the table i bring real value to this company i can help out a lot and if they don't want to see that or if it's not what they're looking for that has nothing to do with my intrinsic value right if i'm sitting there in the job interview there's something that they've already seen that makes them want to call me in for the interview so you did a really good job of sort of attacking this idea of results equals being valuable and and the the interesting thing about the motivation and you didn't you know get there you got really really fast really far and i know you know this but i probably went a little too quick with some of those things because i'm trying to cover it a lot faster than i wouldn't normally yeah yeah so so i i think that was a bit fast but i think it's it's it's great and i think your strength as a teacher really kind of shines through um but i think the key thing that i really want to commend you in is about 20 or 30 minutes i came into this interview expecting being skeptical myself i came into this interview um thinking that this wouldn't help me i'm gonna try it because i'm desperate but deep in my heart i was like resist like i didn't you know i wasn't like okay let's go like it was all like a veneer and so the one thing that you really did very very good and i think very quickly is confuse the hell out of me and and it's my favorite thing to do yeah so so it's it's like you know if we want to rebuild the right kind of mindset the first thing that we have to do is pull apart all the puzzle pieces because then we can start the process of like putting them back together in a healthier way and and so the you know couple things i want to say you you did a good job of helping me understand that hold on a second maybe some of my assumptions are not as held in stone as i thought you did a good job of moving me from kind of pre-contemplative too contemplative so i came in knowing all the answers but knowing all the answers led me to the wrong conclusion so the first thing that you've got to do in coaching which once again you did a really good job of is helping people introducing doubt into their world view because if i'm like a doomer or like i think that nothing's ever going to work for me like you can't let people continue thinking that way and the way that you do that is by actually introducing doubt introducing new concepts getting people to do it i think you did a really good job of actually um first of all you know you take good notes you use your notes really well you did a really good job of when you were explaining certain things tossing in personal experiences that kind of emotionally hit home so you talked about parents you talked about pressure you offered empathy which is not something that i get at all and that too is very perplexing it's like what do you mean it's not my fault like what on earth like the whole world is telling me i'm at fault i wake up every single day and i tell myself it's not my fault the concept that actually my position in life has more to do than my actions and i i'm i know where you're going to go with this because over time ultimately what you know what you want to do is help people understand there is a contribution that you make but there are things that you don't control as well and the problem is when clients start to assume responsibility for the whole world that they can't change that that's when they really start to feel devastated so a fantastic job any thoughts your end was i hard on you i was afraid oh no i think i think it was good um if anything i think there was like uh maybe this is just me um i felt like there were almost too many directions for me to go in as a coach like i have like a lot of things that i was like okay i know like in in a few sessions we're gonna get into this and in a few sessions we're gonna get into control and then we're gonna talk about like should statements and like all these other things like i can see like down the line that's where i would go with this client yeah so can you explain to us what were the directions you saw and what you think the value in some of those directions are just toss out a couple yeah um so should statements is a big one i talk to a lot of people about this um i'm not gonna go into the whole whole spiel i would do in coaching but um the basics behind should statements is they're actually just not true they're ways we feel about something but like when we say like oh people like should do this thing or they i should have done that thing that's not a fact about the world but we treat it like it is and then when we see the real world and that thing is not true then it's really really hard for us to cope with that i should have a job and i don't right and then that brings up tons of shame and other negative emotions all that kind of stuff um so really helping clients identify should statements and start to tweak them so we i call it um changing a two statement fact right so instead of i should have a job say like i want to have a job and i don't and that's hard because that's actually true right you don't have a job and it is hard um but that i should have a job part isn't true that's like societal pressure internal pressure wherever it might come from for that person um the other thing that i uh noted was uh control and understanding like this this is like uh we kind of touched on a little bit when we were talking about results based ideas right and in fact we don't control results of basically anything we control our actions so you can't control what happens you can control what you do about it and so in this case with this client we would have gone into like with goal setting it's not get a job by x date it's apply for this many jobs this week because that's something you can control that's an action and and steve do you find i know this is gonna like please be honest do you find that that works with people yes tell me a little bit about that um i feel like there's so much that we do as a society that puts these pressures these expectations on people and then nobody ever tells them that it's actually okay it's fine it doesn't matter if what you want to do is like you want to do art and you're just going to work at mcdonald's and then like have a studio somewhere and do art that's fine like it doesn't matter what all these things come from but like nobody's ever been told that now he's ever been told that that's acceptable and so they put all this pressure on themselves either internally or it was put on them by their parents or other things in life and again all of those things usually come from results-based ideas so uh steve if i can you know and and by all means protect your clients privacy so sure um but can so i'm gonna ask you for a question if you feel like you can answer try to make it a little bit chimerical have we talked about this before i'm not sure what the question is so yeah basically i'm i'm kind of curious like what have you actually seen your clients accomplish in terms of i mean are do people have you know are they working at mcdonald's and doing studios and you're welcome to change a couple of the details to protect privacy that's what yeah um so i've seen clients who thought they would never move out from their parents house move out i've seen clients who um like thought they couldn't graduate and like get their stuff together and graduate or also i think to me some of the more like moving ones are the ones who realize like i don't even want to graduate like college was never a thing i wanted to do in the first place i'm actually cool just like going and having a job and like living my life and that's personally the things that i find most like inspiring i guess is when we can ask those questions and people will realize like this isn't something i want to do why am i even doing it i'm doing it because i was forced to i'm doing it because my parents told me i had to or whatever other thing in life and so um yeah those are kind of the most the most ones that stick out in my brain i would say there's also i've had clients who had um more severe emotional stuff and just telling them that that stuff's real and it's okay to pursue therapy for it because so many people in life think like oh i've been through this but other people have been through worse things right and just just being that person who tells them no that's real like and it's okay for you to go to therapy like wow it's really impactful for people cool man i'm i'm so honored to have you doing this work and helping our community and stuff like that i'm just thrilled to have the opportunity man i love it here yeah and we love having you you
