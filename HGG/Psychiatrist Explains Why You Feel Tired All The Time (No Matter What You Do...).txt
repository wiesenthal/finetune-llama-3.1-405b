so we have this event going on right now where we're helping our community track their emotions so here's all the emotions that people are feeling what's the number one emotion that people are feeling turns out it's tired now that may sound kind of weird to you because is being tired and emotion to begin with right I thought like being tired was like a state of energy like isn't tired like a lack of sleep so is it like physiologic like is it mental can you feel mentally tired or is tiredness just kind of a physical perspective what about people who you know are not depressed or anything like that aren't burnt out and sort of take care of themselves exercise but they just kind of like when they wake up in the morning they kind of feel they feel like life has no zest there's no excitement is that depression like what is that so what I'd love to do is talk to you all today about tiredness and what we're going to do is approach tiredness from a couple of different angles so we're going to start by talking about the tiredness as an emotion so is it an emotion and what does that even mean like how is tiredness and emotion and sort of related to that the mental aspect of being tired because I know it sounds kind of weird but if you really think about it human beings all have the shared experience of being able to be fought to be tired right so like we can all feel tired and if we all can feel tired tiredness must serve a particular function and if we really want to understand how to overcome tiredness what we need to do is understand why we feel tired in the first place not in a sense to to fix it but what is the function of feeling tired which I know it sounds kind of weird but we think about tiredness especially in today's society is purely a negative thing to get rid of right energy is good tiredness is bad but we never stop to really think about hold on a second like human bodies and brains and subjective experiences exist for a reason there aren't good emotions and bad emotions there are just emotions and emotions are just information right so even something like fear or anxiety is your brain's way of telling you to be worried about something so then the question kind of becomes okay like what is tiredness for like why do we feel tired and the cool thing is once we start to understand that we can start to see scenarios in which we feel tired and then we'll understand why we feel tired in those scenarios and where it's really coming from and once we discover where where it's coming from we can start to take steps to combat it overcome it or even sort of accept it as information so first thing that I'm going to share with you all is a story okay so I was working with a patient who hated going back home for the holidays so really like was like enjoyed having time off from work but really really hated going back home for the holidays the holidays were just so exhausting and it's not just being there so this patient was telling me she was telling me one day that you know she got a phone call and on the phone like she she picks up her phone she looks at it and she sees oh it's in my Mom calling and just the sight of her Mom calling was enough to feel exhausted she's like oh my God I can't deal with this and so let's like stop and think about that so first of all you may find that that's your experience as well that you feel tired but you can feel so tired suddenly which is kind of weird right because if we think about tiredness we think about it as a lack of energy and if I've slept a full eight hours and I ate a nice you know keto low carb meal I shouldn't feel tired that's what we tell ourselves right I shouldn't feel tired because we think about tiredness as a physiologic state we don't think about it as an emotion and then what we end up doing is we try doing all kinds of physical things let me try the supplement let me go get some vitamin D let me go do this thing I'm going to cut out gluten from my diet because we cannot have the gluten right all kinds of stuff that we do physiologically because tiredness is a state of energy and yet we continue feeling tired and sometimes we even feel good about ourselves until you see the Ping oh it's your boss emailing you again at four o'clock on us on a Friday and then how do you feel you feel tired so let's try to understand what tiredness is and why we feel tired so let's go through this so if I see a phone call from let's say a parent that I don't want to talk to or someone who's looking for money or soliciting donations I don't know if you all felt this way I feel this way where I'm walking down the street and sometimes you see those people with the binders you know what I'm talking about those people the binders and a good cause and they look at you and they like try to make eye contact and then they like wave right and then you're like oh my God and then you feel tired I don't want to talk to this person I don't want to be rude with this person I know if I talk to them they're going to ask me questions that are going to make me feel guilty so now I have a choice between losing some money or feeling bad about myself because I'm not making the world a better place and all this kind of stuff goes on in your head in the span of like three seconds and you feel exhausted so what's going on there right how does that work so tiredness is actually an Adaptive mechanism created by your brain to help you avoid kind of useless work okay I know it sounds kind of weird but here's what happens so like let's let's talk about something like paying your taxes so here's where I am right now and I gotta pay my taxes in the workload from paying my taxes is so high that my brain looks at that and says there's no way we're going to be able to pay our taxes today we can't do it the estimate of the workload is very very high and then what it does is it makes us feel tired so tiredness is our brain's response to a perception of a high workload so when we see a super high workload what we naturally feel is tired and you may say to yourself but hold on Dr k isn't that when you should have a burst of energy shouldn't we if the task is really big shouldn't I need a ton of energy so that I can complete the task and I want to work on my taxes for 24 hours and then tomorrow I will be done with my taxes it'll be great it'll be liberating but instead what you do is you feel tired so let's think about the situation which our brain evolved when there are things that have a ton of work our brain sort of calculates okay this is going to be a ton of work and it may not even succeed so generally speaking the more work that something requires the chances of success are going to be lower so if I wake up today and I say okay like I'm going to become president of the United States or Secretary General of the UN that takes a ton of work the likelihood of that succeeding is going to be low I'm going to start a billion dollar company I'm going to start a company that's going to use teleportation technology and invent time travel technology the amount of effort required for that is going to be very high and generally speaking if we look at what the greater effort is required for something the lower the chances are for success and so then how does our brain prevent us from wasting energy on low success probability things that require a high amount of energy investment it makes us feel tired because what is tired tired is don't do it don't bother don't try stop I'm not going to give you the energy I'm not willing to invest this amount of energy for such a rare difficult thing now this brain evolved prior to the development of taxes right so now what we're sort of seeing is that this fundamental mechanism which is like our brains evolved and they're like oh let's go climb to the top of that mountain and you look to the top of the mountain you're like oh my God that's like so much climbing no way dude I'm tired so if you really think about it what does tiredness do it discourages you from investing energy in like really really long-term questionable kind of things and now the problem is that we live in a society where we've got stuff like paying taxes which absolutely have to be done but our brain doesn't know how to calculate paying taxes it doesn't know how to say okay we're gonna have to put in four hours a day for the next 10 days and then we'll be done it's not actually how long it takes to pay your taxes right but if you think about how long does it feel like it feels like it's going to take a really really really long time and then even at the end of four hours of paying your taxes today are you going to be done with it is it going to be finished other examples of this include writing a dissertation I gotta write my dissertation today you can't write your dissertation day it takes a year oh my God that's so much work I'm so exhausted I can't even do anything today so when our brain estimates that there's a very very high workload with unclear chances of success or progress that's visible it protects us from wasting energy into that thing there's no point if we're going to try to climb to the top of Mount Everest there's no point in climbing the first five thousand feet if we're not going to make it to the top you know because it's like okay like let's say Everest is what twenty six thousand feet or 29 000 feet or something like that right what's the point of going up 25 000 feet turning or turning around and coming back there's no point you didn't climb Everest I went to go climb Mount Everest everyone asks you what was it like at the top and you're like I don't know I turned back right there's you might as well not have gone and so that's how our brain operates it looks at this really far goal in the future and it's like hey let's not waste our time in this boom let's flip the tired switch and so feeling tired is actually an energy conservation strategy it's a way to shape our Behavior it's a way that our brain is making calculations and then using emotions to keep us from making mistakes the same way that it uses anxiety to keep us from making mistakes the same way that it uses anger to help us lay our boundaries and not get taken advantage of by other people it uses tiredness to keep us from wasting our energy now the problem is that oftentimes we need to invest that energy right like it's actually worthwhile so if y'all want to understand tiredness what I encourage you to do is start by noticing in your mind what is the scenario in which I'm tired because it's sudden right it's like you see that like oh my God I don't want to go home for the holidays my parents are divorced I hate Christmas with divorced parents because no matter what I do neither of my parents is going to be happy right one of them gets me on Christmas Eve and one of them gets me on Christmas Day and at 11 59 pm on Christmas Day I know I'm gonna hear the car come up parents is going to come and they're going to want me for the rest of the day and so I've spent one night with one parent and that was like sort of fun but I knew that this was gonna happen the next day so I can't really relax and then as I walk out the door one parent is going to be tearing up and the other parent is going to be like resentful and needy like come on let's go we're gonna have so much fun today we gotta make up for all the fun that we didn't have yesterday let's go have fun let's do it man and the thought of going home for the holidays just the thought of it of being in that situation is exhausting the thought of going home for the holidays and telling everyone everyone's like ah little Outlook how are you doing today my love what are you up to nowadays oh nothing auntie I'm still applying to medical school I'm 26 years old I have no money I have no prospects failed a lot of classes and I'm not really doing much how are you um your son just got a job at Google fantastic you must be so proud so tiredness is actually an emotion and that may sound kind of weird but remember that emotions are not psychological things they're physiologic things too our body and our brain are connected our mind and body are connected so the experience of emotion lumps in the throat butterflies in the stomach tightness in our chest erection of the penis is an emotion arousal lust you bet your ass that lust has physiologic correlations right that's an emotion and so similarly if emotions are both physiologic and psychological and we experience a lot of tiredness in our body why do we assume that that's physiologic exclusively physiologic in nature why can't it be psychological too because tiredness is an emotion we even use the right language you say I feel tired it's a feeling and it's our body's natural or Minds natural response to tasks that we feel are very very difficult to accomplish and so we say don't even bother like like don't do the taxes today you can do them tomorrow start the dissertation tomorrow you don't answer the phone call today right and then what happens when you don't answer the phone call by the way what's going to happen 10 minutes from now what's going to happen tomorrow what's going to happen a week from now what's going to happen a month from now the phone calls keep coming and they keep coming and they keep coming and eventually maybe they'll stop but even if they stop you still feel exhausted and that doesn't make any sense from an energy perspective because you didn't even do anything you didn't even talk to anyone you just hit the phone on silent and continued unpaused your video game and kept playing how is that exhausting there's no amount of energy like it's I click buttons all the time it doesn't Tire me out so of course tiredness is an emotion of course it's mental in nature so the next time you feel tired think a little bit about like okay what about this is exhausting because it ain't the energy it's not the caloric burning that my body has to do in order to turn the phone on silent right it's not the the calories I have to burn to listen to my aunt tell me about how their kid is so amazing like I'm just sitting there I can listen to crap all the time it doesn't exhaust me in fact sometimes I rather enjoy it have you heard of an audiobook so it's not energetic it's all emotional and so then the question becomes okay like like how do we understand this so like ask yourself right pause and notice oh wow I'm feeling incredibly exhausted what is my body telling me not to do then the question becomes why is my body telling me not to do it and that's where the answer lies to notice first of all there's nothing wrong with you right you may be totally fine physiologically but that this is a signal just like all other emotions emotions are information from the body and the mind to you and then as you start to add okay this is a signal like this is my body telling me not to do this I feel so tired oh my God this person wants to go out on a date again this is the fifth date I'm just kind of tired tonight that's your body kind of telling you hey we're not that into them right it's a waste of energy that's what tiredness is tiredness is a signal that there's a part of you that feels like this is is a waste of energy since it's a waste of energy we're not going to waste it we're going to help you feel tired that way we don't have to expend anything and as you ask yourself okay what am I why is this does this feel like a waste of energy to me what does this encounter what will this encounter actually do how will I feel if I were to do the tired thing or the thing that makes me feel tired how would I feel at the end of it and now here's where something magical happens you get to really get underneath the tiredness because your mind will tell you one of two things if I spent two hours working on my taxes today how would I feel at the end of that if you stop and you actually ask yourself you say actually I'd feel pretty good or your mind may say oh we'd still feel terrible because we have so much left to do even if you do two hours of work there's so much left to do therefore logically don't start at all right because that's what our mind tells us just ask yourself if I started on my dissertation today if I read one chapter of one thing how would I respond and my mind would be like oh you read like one chapter of like 100 you have so much left to do so let's not even start because we have 100 chapters three don't even bother reading the first one and it's like what and if your mind is telling you that how the hell are you ever going to do anything so that's when you start to really realize okay hold on a second how is my mind making this calculation and as you start to really understand oh actually if I went like give you all another example I'm going exercising so if I exercise how am I going to feel at the end of it am I going to feel good or am I not going to feel good because a lot of times the things that we feel tired doing we actually feel really good when we're done doing them it's like hey I made some progress today awesome I exercise today awesome and if our brain is telling us hey like you're gonna feel worse after making progress then that's the problem that's when we need to start to think a little bit about wait wait hold on a second how am I arriving at the conclusion that I'm gonna feel worse after I do something that I should be doing and that I need to be doing how am I feeling worse and then you tunnel down into that and as you tunnel down into that you can make a discovery holy crap my brain is actually disincentivizing me to make making progress in life no wonder I'm stuck and if you do a good job what something magical will happen which is that remember we said that the tiredness is a feeling that the brain evokes when it estimates the amount of work that you have to do and it estimates that since we're not going to get there there's no point in trying it's an energy conservation strategy but as you start to really understand okay if I do this I'm actually going to feel good as you start to take that end point and you start to like really be more more critical of it what you'll start to realize is that your brain actually realizes okay hold on a second maybe this isn't such a waste of energy and now we also see why certain productivity techniques work which is taking a large abstract task and chunking it into pieces because if I have a hundred chapters to read that's a lot of chapters but if my Target today is one I have completed my target then it's not a waste of energy reading chapter one chapter lets me finish one chapter that's actually a pretty good trade and then suddenly we feel less tired in terms of like relationship stuff it's also really really really important to understand this kind of thing right so when it comes back to visiting family for the holidays for example why do I feel so tired when I see this phone and the reason I feel tired is because I know that this person is relying on me for their emotional needs and I cannot fulfill their emotional needs so what they're going to do is suck me dry trying to feel fulfilled emotionally and I'm gonna feel drained at the end of it and it's never going to be enough right because next year we'll come around and they'll still be emotionally needy that's why you feel so exhausted because at the end of this conversation I'm gonna feel exhausted and it's not like the car the calls are gonna stop in fact they're going to start leaning on me more so tunnel down ask yourself what about this makes me feel tired if I were to do this how would I feel afterward and that's really the answer to that question is going to be how you overcome tiredness foreign
