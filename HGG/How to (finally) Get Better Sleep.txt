if you look at some of these old dantrik traditions and things like that they'll say that anything that is kept within you will grow in strength and anything that is ventilated out will diminish this is why mantras in certain esoteric meditation techniques are kept secret because as long as you keep it in here it starts populating your mind does that make sense is this normal happens to me almost every night hey congrats on making it to 35 years old you must be really tired you asleep yet yeah almost asleep remember back when you were in the third grade and no one gave you valentine's card during the class valentine's day celebration no one liked you and jessica was just pretending to be your friend out of pity people still don't like you oh my goodness okay let's talk about sleep let's understand like why the hell the brain does this okay so there is so much that we have forgotten about how our minds work and how sleep works so we're just going to explain this very simply okay so our mind has thoughts and thoughts have a certain energy to them and our mind tends to do a couple of different things with thoughts okay the first thing that it does is indulge the thought so if i think to myself like oh i want pizza my mind is like oh pizza like i'll get it with this and i'll get it with this and i'll be like oh it'll be great like i'm gonna eat this and i'm gonna maybe have this and then i'll have a drink with it and so one thought propagates other thoughts right it's almost like thoughts breed second thing is sometimes when we have thoughts what we tend to do is distract ourselves so if we distract ourselves the the energy of the thought goes dormant so we don't resolve it we'll start doing something else and then that thought energy is like kind of there and sort of goes dormant over time the next thing to understand is that a lot of times our thought since our mind is so occupied there's no space for the dormant thoughts to come up okay so what this sort of means is like if i'm watching if i'm playing video games all day my mind really likes it in a sense because the mind gets occupied with lots of thoughts and then what happens is like all the thoughts that i shoved away because of the video games are still there in some way and then when my mind creates a time of silence or when my mind is empty and does not have any sensory stimulation because remember think a little bit about where where thoughts oftentimes come from is like sensory stimulation so when i'm lost in a video game like i'm getting a bunch of sensory input it's harder to get lost in a video game that i'm playing if i it's muted and it's harder even if the monitor is off right if i have no sensory input from the video game like i can still technically be playing but i'm just not you know i'm not going to be thinking about it does that make sense it's like such a simple experiment that you can do where cut away your sensory input from a video game and see what happens to the video game and how much you think about it if i played league of legends but the only time i played it i was muted and the monitor was off how long do you think i would play league of legends right does that make sense it's kind of weird so why does this happen when we sleep it's because sleep is the time that we don't have any sensory input so we've got all this crap that's left there that starts to like fill this vacuum and our mind starts thinking about like random stuff that happened a long time ago and then it interferes with our sleep because we want to go to sleep but like but this is the problem is this the only dormant time our mind has gotten so now what i want you all to do is think a little bit about the nature in which our our mind evolved so for millions of years what kind of sensory input did we get and how much empty mind time did we have so the reason that our mind does this is because it evolved in a society or circumstance where there was plenty of time to like process or think through the things that we experience on a day-to-day basis we weren't uh sensorily bombarded all the time and you even see this with like people who will develop technology right like they'll make the technology as infectious as possible notification oh by the way did you see this thing and now like if you like so netflix used to show you stills right but now they show you video so you know like they're more and more engaging ads used to be like pictures now they're video so more and more sensory engagement right and that's pretty cool like when i log on like i watch like some like 30 seconds of a clip i'm like oh that's like that looks like a good show then it engages my mind so if you want to stop doing this kind of stuff where your mind like populates things before you sleep the most important thing is to give your mind some space to let its like let the pent up stuff out so this is why like going for a walk before bed can be very good but if you go for a walk ideally don't listen to music and don't participate in conversation if you want to talk you can because then even then like if you have like sort of a light conversation it's like stuff is going to be coming out there's also why you know people have very profound shower thoughts right why is that same principle it's because your mind actually has space to think and the one thing that we've deprived ourselves of we even pay people to take away from us is the space to think and as long as you don't give yourself space to think anytime your mind finds space it will think at you it'll burst out and so even if you like we can understand this principle even in therapy where like therapy is like literally the place that you go that creates a space for you to bring out stuff and like process it and then as you process it in the therapy room you leave and then it's like kind of gone it's like cool how that works there's even a spiritual element to this where if you look at some of these old tantric traditions and things like that they'll say that anything that is kept within you will grow in strength and anything that is ventilated out will diminish this is why mantras in certain esoteric meditation techniques are kept secret because as long as you keep it in here it starts populating your mind does that make sense because like the whole point is that like you didn't process this thing that happened when vicki didn't give you a valentine's day card so it pops up a thought in your mind and so when we do techniques like mantras what we're actually doing is trying to engage this exactly when you do a mantra properly what you're doing is this thought is the mantra instead of a negative thing and when you have a mantra instead of a negative thing it actually like works for you so then anytime you have a quiet moment there's something like some positive mantra that comes out and like instead of this it creates like a positive emotion that's kind of how mantra works and we also kind of know this because people who vent what they do that diminishes in energy right so if you vent a trauma like that hopefully diminishes the energy of the trauma if you vent your brand new business idea it diminishes the energy of the business idea and the business never comes to fruition and we know this so if you're someone who has random thoughts as you fall asleep give your mind some space before you go to sleep to vent whatever random crap you want do that for half an hour 45 minutes and then you'll be surprised it'll be easier to go to sleep this is a good question how to differ differ between overthinking and maladaptive daydreaming and healthy processing very good question so the main question here is does the thought lead to more thoughts or does it diminish more thoughts so when you process something healthily you kind of let it go right you kind of like let it pass through you and it's kind of like gone whereas in the cases of maladaptive daydreaming and overthinking if you go back to like the beginning of this question one thought propagates another thought when you daydream each thought creates an additional thought and creates an additional thought that's what happens in the daydream right it's kind of starting with like a single like lego and then you're building stuff with it and the more that you build with it the bigger it gets and the more it occupies your mind i'm gonna build a house oh i have a house now i need a window now a window now i need people i'm going to put people in there oh now the people need a garage so i'm going to build a garage now the garage needs a car so i'm going to have a car now the car needs a place to go to so i'm going to make an airport now i have an airport i need an airplane that's maladaptive daydreaming one thing propagates another you can create an entire fictional universe in your mind whereas when you emotionally process you feel kind of tired at the end of it and you're done enough and your mind moves on to other things so very important distinction so someone else is saying i usually read before bed is that a distraction usually yes now there can be other benefits to reading before bed like other kinds of things because it's like physiologically it's a calming activity you can engage your parasympathetic nervous system you're not looking at a screen so if you're not looking at a screen you're not inhibiting melatonin production so melatonin can start ramping up while you're reading so a lot of good reasons to read before bed but when you're reading you're not really giving space to your mind if that makes sense right you're still occupying it with something okay does that make sense
