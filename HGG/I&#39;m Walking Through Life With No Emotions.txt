if you feel hunger then you're gonna go eat something but if you have no appetite that you know your body needs the food but you're not you're not driven or motivated to do it do you do you guys ever go through periods of just feeling nothing i'm not talking about seasonal depression or whatever at least then you're feeling down and well depressed i don't feel anything period i don't get angry when i feel like i should be angry i don't feel accomplished when i feel like i've accomplished something i don't feel pleasure nor sadness nor hate nor anything it's all emotions it's like all emotions have been drained from me i don't enjoy learning new things and i'm not as curious as i once was i don't feel anything when i solve an enigmatic puzzle i used to enjoy watching anime but now it's more like i don't mind i don't mind watching anime i feel like all of those things that define me early used to i feel no more than a shell i'm 18 now and i don't think i'm supposed to feel like a shell right i visited our slash anhedonia and i related to most of the posts to a scary degree i want to say i'm scared to be living like this but i'm not actually scared i don't feel scared it's just that i realize that this is not how it ought to be i know that i don't want to be living like this i feel like this has been developing for the past year or so and i did not and i did get depressed from time to time time and at some points i was even suicidal but the general decline towards anhedonia was always in progress mind you this is all self-diagnosed i never asked for help if there is any hope i'm clinging to it's because i occasionally feel something but it's very faint what should i do should i be concerned is this temporary so let's talk about this sometimes we feel numb and the tricky thing about feeling numb when we stop enjoying things we don't even feel fear it's like you look at yourself and you're like man i'm not really enjoying life this should bother me more than it is i should be concerned about this i should feel fear you even acknowledge that like you should be experiencing more negative emotion but like you don't and so it sort of bothers you but you're not worried about it right or you're worried about it but you don't feel worried about it it's like there's some part of you that's floating above which is like hey this is not right this is not okay but the challenge is that normally when things in our life are not okay that negative emotion can actually be motivation to go and fix it right where it's like if you feel hunger then you're gonna go eat something but if you have no appetite that you know your body needs the food but you're not you're not driven or motivated to do it so sometimes we feel numb and then we talk about anhedonia so anhedonia is is a term that means the inability to experience pleasure anaedonia is oftentimes associated with clinical depression major depressive disorder or depressive episodes bipolar disorder and so the interesting thing is that we like we may think okay so like if i'm end hedonic what a lot of people will jump to is that means i'm depressed i need clinical treatment but anhedonia is just a feature of depression just like insomnia is a feature of depression or weight changes are a feature of depression it doesn't mean that all people who are ant hedonic are depressed in the same way that everyone who has difficulty sleeping is not depressed so anhedonia describes our experience but there's actually studies on people who are an hedonic who are not depressed for whom anhedonia is the primary problem and i'd love to share with you all some of the learnings of what those studies show and like how we can understand the situation okay so let's take a look at some neuroscience this is some super cool translational research by the way so this is going to be my attempt at explaining if you should feel worried about your life but you don't even feel worried and you have difficulty feeling anything at all what's going on so the first thing we're going to talk about three parts of the brain ventromedial prefrontal cortex part of our frontal lobe nucleus accumbens which is our dopamine reward circuit and then third thing is going to be our amygdala and limbic system okay which is over here so this experiences negative emotion this is essentially a controller so what does that mean so let's talk about anxiety so when i feel anxiety okay so let's use the color yellow so when i feel anxiety this activates this part of my brain when i get my anxiety over under control when i overcome my anxiety my ventromedial prefrontal cortex inhibits this basically overrides my emotion so anytime we control get control of our emotions it's the ventromedial prefrontal cortex that controls it the other thing that happens is as i get anxiety this is going to go over here and control my behaviors so the nucleus accumbens and the dopamine circuitry is what essentially governs behavior it says hey go do this thing because it is rewarding okay so it's like where motivation comes from so if you're numb we're going to start with a clinical observation which is that when you numb yourself you can't selectively numb yourself it's just not how it works we can't really selectively stop feeling negative emotions and just feel all the positive emotions there are sort of ways that we do that usually drugs of abuse are good examples of this that will just increase your your sense of euphoria artificially right but generally speaking our natural intrinsic brain mechanisms cannot just numb all the sadness and just make us feel happy why is that it's because the reason we've evolved to feel sadness is because it's actually like for survival benefit so anxiety like helps us survive sadness helps us survive fear helps us survive and so our brain actually evolved to experience happiness and sadness so what's going on in people who are numb what's going on in essentially the pathophysiology of people who are completely numb so there's some really interesting studies that have been done first is that this part so now let's talk about numbness okay this part is altered this part is altered generally speaking what we say is that when we want and this part is altered to generally speaking we want to strengthen our frontal lobes so that we can get control of our anxiety and then we can act independent of anxiety when you look at studies of people who are anhedonic both with depression and without depression what you find is alterations in this circuit and essentially what we tend to see is over activity of the ventromedial prefrontal cortex when we meditate we strengthen the ventromedial prefrontal cortex but in people who are ant hedonic this is very very strong so isn't that a good thing because that's the goal of meditation it's the goal of meditation if you're anxious because in the case of someone whose anxiety controls their behavior their ventromedial prefrontal cortex is weak in this case it's weak but in people who are numb it's actually very strong now why is that or what what does that mean what that means is that it's suppressing our emotions very very powerfully there's also other things going on where in people who are anhedonic there's a really interesting study about the pleasure from sucrose so if i take if i take people and i give them an increasing sucrose concentration so i tell them to drink something sweet what i tend to find is that let's say normal people let's say this is the pleasure threshold so above this point a normal person experiences pleasure when someone is anhedonic their pleasure threshold is here because they literally need more of the same stimulus to start to experience the same amount of pleasure so to get one unit of pleasure i need a higher level of sucrose so what's going on there that comes to the dopamine reward circuitry this is lower so what's actually happening is our ventromedial prefrontal cortex directs our attention and so it almost compensates from a reward circuitry that's stunted by increasing its activity does that make sense because my ability to feel pleasure is is weakened so what i need to do is actually like ramp up this so that i can try to boost this the interesting thing is when i ramp this up it also numbs me out so it's kind of weird that way my ability to feel pleasure is negatively impacted therefore my cortices try to compensate for the other parts of my brain that's what the controller does it's always trying to compensate always trying to compensate and so as it ramps up its activity it suppresses everything else so if you're an hedonic let me see if i can actually find this paper yeah this is fantastic paper neurobiological mechanisms of anhedonia translational research there's one thing that i want to show you all in specific a neural basis of positive emotion neuropharmacology of endodontic major yes neural basis of trait anhedonia in non-depressed sub subjects oh you guys can't see that there we go this is the coolest part of this whole paper because it looks at anhedonia and people who are not depressed and figures out what's going on so the ventromedial prefrontal cortex for the processing of positive emotion is pop is positively correlated okay so we won't go into too much detail in the paper but so if you're numb is it normal no should you be worried about it sure are you worried about it no because you're numb what's going on it's actually an interesting circuit of under active reward circuitry a compensatory change in your prefrontal cortex and when your pre-prefrontal cortex cortex gets activated it numbs your negative emotions as well basically oversimplifying because the brain is complicated there's no way you can reduce it this simply so the question is what do we do about it right so where does the problem originate chat what do y'all think how do we reset some of this stuff you need more anxiety that's possible it's funny so someone's meming right so what's the what what answers are y'all going to give me number one need more anxiety you think you're trolling but you're not wrong ah someone's talking about dopamine detox okay y'all are y'all are actually precisely correct i can't even tell if people were being serious so they're mean meaning so the first thing that you've got to do is reset this nucleus accumbens okay so what is the most common cause of underactivity of the nucleus accumbens is dopaminergic overstimulation so when i've worked with people who are anthodonic and we sort of know this right like if i play a video game for one hour it's fun the 10th hour i play it is the game even fun am i actually like enjoying it no if i spend 60 hours a week playing a video game do i have more fun or less fun than if i play a game for six hours a week so first thing you've got to do reset your dopamine so we've done videos we've had discord events about dopamine detoxes we've also debunked other dopamine detoxes which are largely bs but you've got to reset your dopamine so what i'd say is for two weeks you know drastically decrease or cut out youtube social media twitch gaming because you've got to reset your nucleus accumbens once your nucleus accumbens resets hopefully your ventromedial prefrontal cortex will start to calm down as it'll calm down you'll start to feel negative emotions so y'all aren't wrong the second thing you need to do is become aware of negative emotions so if we paid attention to this person's post they were saying like you're not completely numb right you just feel a lot less than when you should than what you should so when you feel something negative try to understand what you're feeling really try to increase your emotional awareness and what you'll tend to find is that when you become aware of your negative emotion even the smallest negative emotion what you're going to find is that there's a response to the negative emotion and when you have this response to the negative emotion there's going to be a reflexive action so when i'm feeling sad without even realizing it i'm going to start browsing reddit and guess what this reflexive action does messes up your dopamine so ironically feeling more anxious is actually the right answer so they're going to be small moments throughout the day where you experience emotions observe the emotion and most importantly acknowledge what it is and then don't stop the reflexive action and as you stop the reflexive action the emotion will increase it'll feel a little bit uncomfortable but since your nut brain is pretty good at numbing you know it's going to be a slow process of letting it out a little bit by a little bit by little bit and as you stop the reflexive action you're gonna stop messing with your dopamine and so we sort of see that it'll sort of fix the problem the problem with this is that as you fix the problem what are you actually going to experience you're going to feel more negative emotion so be aware of that and as you feel more negative emotion the good news is that you'll feel more positive emotion and then you'll recalibrate so it's interesting because we see this kind of situation a lot nowadays where people are numb and then they think about anhedonia they're like oh man it sounds like i'm anthony so one thing that we should also say is that if you are an endodontic this is not a good idea you should probably go see a provider and get evaluated because if you have a clinical illness that is causing the anhedonia because remember that neural pharmacology of anhedonia and major depressive disorder there are two different things that could be going on you could be depressed or you could not be depressed the pathway for each of those things is different you could definitely do this one as well if you're depressed but there's a whole other set of stuff that's going on in the case of actual depression right and how we assess anadonia and how we treat anahedonia so you should get a clinical evaluation but then recognize this cycle that the numbness is is through hyperactive activity of the ventromedial prefrontal cortex which is to compensate for a hypoactive nucleus accumbens and then once your nucleus accumulates by the way is hypoactive you're going to like have trouble with motivation as well so you don't enjoy things as much and then you're you try to balance that negativity by activating your prefrontal cortex the thing is when you activate that prefrontal cortex it suppresses your negative emotion as well and so you end up being completely numb and you can reverse that cycle through first of all dopamine detox goes a long way but secondly awareness of the negative emotion and not distracting yourself or suppressing that negative emotion through the reflexive action the problem is that when you stop suppressing it you're gonna start feeling more and that's gonna be like too much to handle so you gotta learn how to swim in more chaotic waters right you gotta get out of the kiddie pool and like get into the big pool and then eventually like get into a pond get into a lake get into a river and get into the the ocean the ocean of emotion baby you
