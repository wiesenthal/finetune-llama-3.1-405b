so let's take a look can you really change who you are okay i've been doing a lot of introspection this year and dr k really helped kick start that for me and i feel like i'm finally waking up to who i have been i feel like i've been dishonest with everyone in my life because i've always played whatever character i think best fits the situation instead of being my authentic self even with respect to my own self image i thought of myself as a really good person yet i've treated women with no respect and ruined all the relationships i've been in by never telling them how i really feel about things i guess what i want to know is if i do keep working hard to better myself in these fundamental ways how do i get over the disgust i feel towards myself i feel like i want to move to a new town by myself and just stay by myself like a time chamber until i feel ready to come out maybe time is all that's needed i'm just feeling really down tonight i love you guys thank you so this unfortunately is a really common problem right so sometimes we're on a journey of self-growth and as we start to introspect as we start to dig into who we are as we start to think critically about ourselves what we find is something that's not very pleasant right we start to realize okay now that i'm really looking at myself for like the first time i'm realizing like holy crap i've been quite dishonest and even though like on in some ways like i think of myself as a good person what i realize is that i haven't been very authentic i've treated people with disrespect i've messed up relationships and sometimes we also feel like disgusted by ourselves right we're like holy crap i had no idea that this it's actually like this is bad right like i how do i overcome that how do i like overcome the disgust and then i can understand this as well because sometimes what we want to do is like we want to go into a cocoon right we want to disappear we want to move across country and like we realize that we're so screwed up that we need to like go somewhere to a different location enter this hibernation chamber of self-work and come out on the other side like a new human being this is something i understand all too well because it's exactly why i went to india i was like man i suck at life i need to like go and transform myself into a good human being and i even went like halfway across the world or across the world and like went to a new place and studied with monks and in my journey that was my time chamber so it's something i really understand so that's something that happens a lot right as we start to walk the journey of self-growth we discover things that are kind of sus and as we discover those things we really want to fix them and we can feel like you know disgusted with ourselves so how what do we do about this okay so can you really change who you are it's a great question so that's where i'm going to start with you know a couple of simple points so when we say like can you change who you are the first question is like who are you right how do you determine like who you are so sure we talked a little bit about the true self and stuff like that but we'll we'll take a step back from that for a second so like you know if you're disgusted with yourself and you like want to be a good person right because you sometimes used to think of yourself as a good person then you discovered all this crap that you're doing which you never realized does that make you a bad person so i think the first question to ask yourself is like what makes a good person and what makes a bad person right so like just think about that because if your goal is to be a good person and we want to change who i am right that's the goal let's start by defining like what makes a good person it's kind of interesting so this is why a lot of people struggle to become good people because if you start to ask like what makes a good person like i don't know right so some people may say okay like what makes a good person is like doing good things so that's kind of interesting right so it's like so if i do good things does that make me a good person not really right because we sort of say that good people can do bad things and bad people can do good things so we still sort of have this idea of a good person and a bad person so if we kind of look at it a little bit more we can say well on balance if i you know help more than i hurt then i'm a good person which i still don't know if i entirely agree with that it sort of makes sense so let's say i'm a surgeon and i've you know saved 99 people's lives and i you know have i'm drunk driving one day and there's a tragic accident and you know the people i run into another car and someone passes away my good person then like because i've saved 99 people's lives and maybe i've taken two or three and does that make me a good person or a bad person so the first thing to kind of like so as you kind of dig into this you may come up with your own answers sort of i i lean heavily on once again eastern perspectives which i'm about to share this is the way that i see it okay this is the model that i use so the first is that as we sort of talked about already like there's a true self and there's a false self and that people are neither good nor bad you just are right there's like you just are that fundamentally human beings all have intrinsic value it's not like based on your actions or anything like that like all human beings have some sense of value in the eastern perspective there's also this idea of the true self right which is which is like not anything that can be described who you truly are is not good or bad is not smart or dumb is not rich or poor is not professionally successful or professionally unsuccessful is not level 60 in lost ark not level 20 and lost earthquake whatever so we can fill it up with ego and ego can assign us to be good or bad but at the core of the day like the humanness within you is sort of like fixed and neutral and generally speaking positive okay so then the question becomes well what about actions right so can you really change who you are and what about actions this is where i i like the theory of karma so the theory of karma sort of says that you know you could take actions and actions have consequences and we as human beings tend to assign value to actions so there's another really interesting thing about the theory of karma is that a lot of people think that like so we're going to talk about garma for a second so a lot of people think that like good karmas cancel out bad karmas right so i'm going to tell you all a quick joke so three mathematicians go to an archery range and so the first one shoots an arrow right and it goes 10 feet to the left of the target it's like damn it and the second one shoots an arrow it goes 10 feet to the right of the target and the third one jumps up and says we hit it right that's what we think of we think of like life is a balance but the truth is that like averaging stuff doesn't isn't actually how life works so in the case of the surgeon so you can do 99 good deeds and it doesn't allow you to like get away with one bad deed right each thing has its own consequence the other way to think about it is that you know if i throw a ball up in the air like that ball is going to come down if i throw a ball down towards the floor and it bounces off the floor it's going to come up it's not like throwing one ball up in the air and throwing the other ball down at the air at the same time that both balls stay the same right each action that we take has its own consequences and so you can make a determination and you can decide for yourself and you can say okay what's the ratio of like good actions to bad actions that makes you a good person i actually don't think that that exists i think it's apples and oranges that you can't be a good person right the only things that you can do you can do good deeds and you can do bad deeds but you as a person are like relatively fixed now we can absolutely from a practical societal perspective say that you know like this is a bad person but this is something that like i've come to understand a lot you know working in addiction psychiatry is that oftentimes when someone is addicted to a substance they feel like bad people and they're told by their family members that they're bad people and sort of because they've done a lot of bad crap right like they've like hit people while drunk driving they've like you know ruined marriages they've been toxic to their children and so they naturally feel really bad about themselves and are those bad actions absolutely should you take responsibility and accountability for your actions absolutely and helping that person get better helping that person start to be in a place where they can make the world a better place starts by some amount of like fundamental understanding that you are neither a good person or a bad person have you done bad things absolutely should you pay for those absolutely and that doesn't doom you to being a bad person right ultimately if you're saying that bad actions make you a bad person then by definition you should be able to do good actions to make you a good person i don't really buy into that right because i'm saying that who you are and what you do are independent practically we make make some judgments in the real world right which is okay but the core of the thing if you're asking can you really change like i don't in a sense i don't think so what you can change is your actions but as a human being you can't change now the caveat there is that i probably don't agree with any kind of negative judgment that you have about yourself right because you are just what you are you are neither good nor bad but you can absolutely change your actions so the next thing that i kind of want to point out is so actually one more point here which is that once we make an identity determination about ourselves that influences what we believe we're capable of right so if i view myself as a loser i won't actually act in a way that improves my life so like if i if i'm a loser i'm not going to apply for a promotion because i'm a loser if i'm attracted to someone i'm not going to ask them out because i'm a loser so what happens is the sense of identity about i'm a bad person starts to shape our life and become a self-fulfilling prophecy so that's why like i really like the yogic perspective because i it seems like it's helped a ton of people because like you are neither good nor bad you are just you it's your actions that can be good or bad and so if you want to transform your life don't worry about transforming your identity just transform your actions right because that's like ultimately what's important like you can be a bad person even if you believe you're a bad person if you're a surgeon who saves 99 lives and then you have a drunk driving accident and then you spend you spend some time in jail or whatever whatever these is the appropriate accountability then you get out of jail and you dedicate your life to saving a thousand more people i think that's fantastic is it unfortunate that you had that negative karma absolutely should you take responsibility for it absolutely and that one event does not determine anything about the rest of your life right you can choose to act in a positive way after that point so now this person has more than than just this question right so can you really change i think in a sense no because you are what you are but what you if you think what you are is bad then i disagree it's kind of weird answer okay but there's like a subtle point here so i guess what i want to know is if i keep working hard on myself in these fundamental ways how do i get over the disgust i feel towards myself this is tricky very very tricky so you can't get over the disgust you feel towards yourself kind of a weird thing to say right so i want you all to think about this for a second really pay attention the desire where does the desire to get over the disgust you have within yourself come from do y'all understand that question right so i okay i want to get over my self disgust right what is the energy that is driving this goal it is disgust right i'm disgusted with myself that's why i need to get over it the desire to get over your own disgust is coming from disgust you all see that it's crazy it's like this part of me is revolting so i need to get rid of it which the part of you that thinks that that's revolting is in and of itself revolted by it so you can't get over it in fact this is why people get stuck right because anyone who wants to change that like listen is language how do i change who i am do you guys get that this question can only be asked if you have a fundamental disgust for yourself why do you need to change well because i'm a sticky ugly person on the inside so even as you try to improve what you're actually doing is reinforcing that disgust do you all get that like you can't want to change the the more you want to change the more you don't accept yourself the more disgusted you are with yourself right it's kind of really wild but this energy so accomplishing this goal and this is why people get stuck right this is why they get stuck because the more that you do this the more that you're actually giving in to that sense of disgust you're feeding it right it's interesting so be careful about that so the question is okay like what do you do about it right so do we get over it no but are we gonna leave it there absolutely not right so we can we can move forward but we don't wanna we don't want to get over it this is where we need to accept it the solution is not getting over right because getting over implies i am bad and i need to transform into i am good this is good this is change who i am this is the goal oh whoop sorry oh my god sorry about that okay so i want to get over my self-disgust right this is coming from disgust this is the key thing so the solution is acceptance and so i am bad i'm good this is what you want to accomplish right so you want to change who i am but this over here is so this process is a lack of acceptance do you all see that it's not accepting this at all in fact it's doing the exact opposite it's doing it's saying that i'm disgusted with myself i need to change i don't want to accept myself at all like this needs to be different so interestingly enough and even if we do that what we're going to be doing the more that we try to overcome our disgust the more that we're feeding and giving into our lack of acceptance of ourself okay so the question is how do you accept what does that look like so this is where you can say you can say to yourself you know i thought of myself as a really good person yet i've treated women with no respect and ruined all relationships okay so that's like that's what this person believes so what do you say well what you say is like yeah so i've made a lot of mistakes right i used to think of myself as a good person i've realized that i've done a lot of bad things i'm not really sure if i'm a good person or a bad person and that's okay i'm working on it right so i may have screwed up a lot of things i may have treated people with disrespect but today i can do better i can treat people differently and it comes down to karma right it comes down to actions i can change the actions that i take i have no idea on the cosmic sense whether i'm a good person or a bad person i certainly don't judge that about myself i don't know who has the capacity to judge whether i'm a good person or a bad person but so be it this is like my journey i'm not perfect i may even be a bad person okay but today i can try to do different i can try to act differently right i can like choose to treat women with respect i can choose to try to be nicer to other people i can make choices to ch like not just to change the person that i am but like i can change what i do on a day-to-day basis even if i'm a bad person so oddly enough like that's what acceptance looks like it's acknowledging okay this is okay it's true it's fine right so be it would it be better if things were different sure absolutely but it is what it is right so maybe i'm not a good person i used to think of myself as a really good person now i'm not so sure so be it i'm not going to try to change that i'm just today i'm going to just act i'm going to act in a better way so if even if i'm a bad person can a bad person do good things absolutely can a good person do bad things absolutely right so it comes down to action it comes down to like accepting that maybe you have some parts of yourself that are not good you and everyone else right and if you try to overcome your disgust with yourself that in and of itself is being fueled by your disgust so you're just gonna feed the problem and this is exactly why it's so hard to change yourself right because the way that you change yourself ironically is not through trying to change yourself it's through accepting yourself that's where change begins so you see this like in mind-blowing simplicity with like alcoholics anonymous how do you get sober by admitting you're an alcoholic right you'll start with like and i'm not 100 you know there's a lot of things that i'm not super happy with in terms of a and how they run but if you look at it it's a very effective intervention for a ton of people i don't agree with 100 of their philosophy but like they got a couple of really important things right and that's paradoxically you know the way that you become sober is by accepting that you're an alcoholic right and they start every single statement anytime someone gets up there and speaks it's hi my name is all oak i'm an alcoholic and they own it right and once you own it once you're like you're not saying i'm no longer an alcoholic no one says that right it's a lifelong thing for them and it's it's through that power of acceptance that they actually gain the fortitude and strength to gain sobriety and so in a bizarre way like own it like if you're not a great person so be it you don't have to beat yourself up over it you can accept it and you can change so this is the other thing about acceptance is a lot of people think that acceptance means giving up oh i screwed up no it doesn't mean giving up in fact it means the opposite means accepting where you are and wanting to move forward so if i like fail a test there are two ways i can accept that right one is i can accept it and throw my hands up and the other way is i could okay i failed the test i need to study harder right so acceptance doesn't mean stopping any kind of forward momentum in fact in in my life most of the forward progress i made is through acceptance of my faults and saying like i can take action right i can take positive karma i can work on this so don't get over your disgust just accept it say there's a part of myself that is really really disgusted with my actions that's really interesting like that is hurtful right like there's a part of myself that's like very very upset with me that loathes who i am but it doesn't have to be the whole you it's not the whole you by the way right you can accept that you can say okay so like i'm gonna try to do better so i don't know if i'm a good person i don't know if i'm a bad person but on this particular day i can take an action that is in the right direction last thing to talk about is the time capsule right so sometimes when we're in this situation where we're disgusted with ourselves we just want to retreat from the world go to a place enter a cocoon and come out a fixed human being and this is where i like i said it's something that i understand all too well because it's exactly what i did when i first went to india right like it's like oh i'm going to go to this thing i'm going to transform myself and then i'm going to come back to the world because we view transformation of the self as like separate from the rest of our lives whereas the big lesson i learned in india is like i don't have to be in india to become a monk in fact running away to india was just running away from my problems in a subtle way for my ego to like outperform people who are out performing me so when someone you know when my friends and stuff like got 4.0 gpas and got into medical school and i failed to get into medical school for the second time in a row i was like okay well let me go become a monk because then i i'm above all of this rat race all these doctors who are chasing money i'm better than all of them i'm not materialistic et cetera et cetera it's all running away from my problems and then i realized through thankfully a lot of brilliant teachers and and some you know effort on my own part that i'm going to take my problems with me wherever i go they're my problems running away to india like i'm going to take them with me so you can move to a new town but like your sense of disgust well where is it coming from like where does it live it lives up here it's gonna come with you right so there are absolutely reasons to move for sure like that can be very important like by all means move so if your toxicity is coming from your external environment right by all means move even getting a fresh start like mentally can be a good idea i'm not saying don't don't move just be prepared right i don't think that personal growth can be done you can work on it like very intentionally right you can go to a monastery for a few months by all means like go for it's wonderful experience but like don't assume that just moving somewhere and like working on yourself is like separate from the rest of your life like should you dedicate some amount of time to it absolutely but generally speaking it's gonna you know your attitude towards yourself is gonna come with you so a lot of times we wanna change the person that we are right we think oh i used to think i'm a good person and now i started the journey of introspection and self-reflection which is fantastic and as we start to look critically at ourselves we see a lot of nasty stuff that our mind had been suppressing or ignoring or cognitive biases or whatever and then as a result we want to overcome those things right we want to transform ourselves into a good person the unfortunate tricky thing is that oftentimes the self-loathing is what drives the desire to be better and giving into that self-loathing is actually gonna sort of in a weird way like propagate the problem because i'm gonna overcome the disgust that i hold towards myself by giving in to the disgust that i hold towards myself right and so that's like not a way to fix it so what's the answer acceptance what the hell does that mean i mean sort of acknowledging for a moment that like it's okay that you screwed up right you did screw up you and this is the other thing is we have this idea that if we transform into a good person then we'll suddenly stop screwing up that's dangerous very dangerous right so we see this a lot in terms of people who are like you know have accomplished a lot of good things and then get off track this is like when they you know you do a lot of good work and now that i'm a good person like once you sort of had that identity you can start making excuses for yourself and getting away with doing bad things so we don't want to do that right understand that you can't be a good person or a bad person you're just you and like whether you have a positive impact on the world or a negative impact on the world has to do with your actions so how are you going to live today it's okay that you screwed up in the past have you treated women with disrespect i'm not going to say no big deal but so be it right and do better today make sense questions okay question about the true self am i what i experience or am i the thing that experiences what's the true self there say i experience happiness am i that happiness or am i the consciousness that experiences that happiness excellent question kind of a tricky answer so the first uh thing that i'd say is that you are that which experiences so that's the conclus the classic conclusion that yogis came to is that you are the experiencer and you are not actually any of the experiences so you know when i drink the tea i'm that which tastes the tea i'm not the t that being said there's an interesting caveat because if you look at dion there are different states of consciousness okay so it's kind of weird so generally speaking we're the experiencer but there are some states of consciousness in which the object of observation and the observer become one when you become one with the t okay and even when i work with people in like performance stuff like there's there's times where if you look at like you know if you talk to esports professionals there are moments where they like transcend human limitations and they become one with the game and then like you become some sort of bizarre like you're channeling some sort of like god of the game and that's when you really up like reach peak performance so there are some there's some elements of of consciousness like states of consciousness right so this is more like theoretical esoteric spiritual stuff it's not really scientifically i mean there's some evidence of flow states and stuff like that so i think we're starting to chip away at that but what i'm talking about really is not scientifically validated flow state is the closest thing that we can get to in terms of science but where you become one with the object of your doing so in the flow actually flow state is a really good example of scientifically that right you become one with the writing like you lose yourself and like you are just one with the writing you're one with like the creation of art optimal performance sort of touches on this which the yogis call sort of like beyond but i think those states are actually slightly different and then there are even some mantras that supposedly if you meditate on chant etc will cultivate oneness with the external thing so ahamra masmi is a good example of that where ahamra masami means i am the universe and so it's kind of weird like if you just chant that do you become one with the universe no because chanting is on some level intellectual but when you do month or practice there's more than intellectual activity going on there's a lot of detail about that in dr k's guide so there's theoretically some of these esoteric spiritual practices like chanting a hum brahmasmi which will bridge the gap between like this person and the external world and at that point you may be the happiness but generally speaking i tend to think of you as the experiencer as opposed to the experience does accepting to be a bad person not reinforce the own view identity to be a bad person sort of so it depends on what you how you accept it so that when we're talking about acceptance you can't accept something from the future right like you can't do that you can only accept what is in the present and what has happened in the past so like just because you accept so there are two ways to in a sense accept things but i wouldn't even call one of them acceptance so when you're ahamkar when your past actions form your ahamkar that goes into the future that is the determination that i am a bad person but when we talk about acceptance we're not talking about because remember like that's not who you are you're neither good nor bad the true self is neither good nor bad what you're accepting is that you've made mistakes right that's real acceptance i've screwed up i'm really not in the best place i really haven't used my time wisely and i can change that right and going forward it doesn't have to be that way these are actions i've taken in the past these are individual conversations that i've had with women where i've not treated them with respect in the next conversation that i have with a woman i have a choice i can treat them with respect or i cannot treat them with respect and that's the whole problem that's where like is and now we'll get to this in a second even our next question talks about this is that once it becomes an issue of ego then you're screwed but if it becomes an issue of action then you'll find salvation right there's a road forward so when you accept i wouldn't accept that you're a bad person because i don't think you're a bad person you know even someone who has done bad things doesn't necessarily make them a bad person i don't believe i have the capacity to judge someone as a bad person or a good person my mind may do it when i get upset or frustrated or whatever like that's a real karen you know we want to do that our mind loves to judge other people but like who made me divine that i can judge another human being can i judge their actions like absolutely and this is what i've seen working with people who have addictions like there are a lot of really there are people out there who've done some really bad stuff who can actually end up being like pretty decent human beings and it's just about accepting that you have screwed up and that you can change right and once you own that you've screwed up the interesting thing is it's empowering like it's empowering because that means you're responsible and if you are responsible if you accept that responsibility that also means you have the power to change you
