interestingly enough the way that you reassure yourself is actually through reinforcing that what you're doing isn't good enough hello hello where do you go my friend i i go by tom tom nice to meet you tom nice to meet you thank you for having me here thank you for being here yeah so what's holding you back tom uh so basically what's holding me back lately and not lately but yeah it's not believing truly believing in the validation i receive so even if it come from people that i really care mom dad friends uh or significant others uh i can truly feel that it is real so i and that leads to me uh trying to find answers uh by myself and not trusting when people told me like everything is okay or i'm doing a good job um so yeah i i found it kind of fake and cheesy to think that um i want somebody tell me like i'm doing a great job or uh that's it's all good uh i don't know why but i find it like kind of fake and cheesy to to think i'm doing a good job so i don't try to i don't tend to validate other people because i found i found that it is fake or kind of fake but and that leads to me uh yeah all the time anxiety trying to find my own uh answers to to to the question that i am doing a good job or is it it is all good here um but yeah so are you able to find your own answers that you're are you able to validate yourself um [Music] mostly i do that by by yeah just working work harder or not work harder but find my own goals and objectives and doing them i found that that's what makes me feel that i'm doing a good job but i mostly yeah i mostly don't don't find my own answers okay so so let let me just let's like understand that a little bit so you're saying that when you're concerned that you're not doing a good job you'll try to come up with goals and the answer that you sometimes come up with that works is to work harder is that fair yeah that's fair but not much really i refer a little bit more about um [Music] yeah um sorry i'm losing my my thoughts here but that's okay so um can i ask you again so when you look for your when you look for your own answer sometimes the way that you can help yourself feel better in that situation is to work harder yeah sometimes it is sometimes right but but there is sometimes that it's not a thing about working harder or not to give you an example maybe i'm i'm on a place that or a party or something that i don't feel safe in it or don't feel a hundred percent comfortable so somebody came a friend came and said tell me like it's all good people are good are not judging you or people is cool um and that's another example when i can truly believe that uh but you don't believe that or you do believe that i don't believe that because i it's like uh i i keep feeling that the place is not safe and and i can't feel comfortable in in some situations okay so to give you a little bit more perspective on this uh this is something i have been working on on therapy um sorry i said good for you can you tell me more thank you thank you yeah uh that we find out that uh at some point of my childhood uh my house became very toxic toxic um my dad and my sister keep fighting a lot all days very toxic ambient but the thing is that i was really put on a side so i was the the child that um so all the fighting all the talks this place uh um was during the night when i i wasn't so if so it was like all item for me um the only thing that i heard is my mom coming to me and saying saying that it's all good and then there's no problem and that there's not no not a reason to to be fearful or anything and at the same time i'm hearing my dad yelling and my sister yelling and i think that it is what made me not being able to to believe in in any validation that someone can give me uh so yeah basically okay well that was very helpful i think that puts things in context it answers a lot of my questions um so let's so let me just make sure i i understand you tom yeah um so sometimes you're in a situation where you feel not confident and sometimes people will try to reassure you and their reassurance doesn't work and so then what you'll do is you'll try to like come up with your you'll go through your own process of reasoning to try to figure out okay is is what i'm doing okay or not okay and even when you go through your own process sometimes you sort of conclude that you're not okay but there are some situations in which you can sort of say okay like let me just work harder and then you can kind of feel good about yourself is that fair to say yeah that's exactly it okay so let me ask you something if you're looking if you're trying to figure out if you're doing something wrong or right and your answer is i need to work harder does that mean that you're doing a good job or not a good job um i think that maybe it's it's not that i'm not doing a good job but it's a thing that it's not enough so i think i i looked for that answer um for yeah i don't trust anybody telling me like it is enough it is good don't work any harder so i just go and work harder i think or do a lot of more research and find what else can i do to to improve in that okay good right so that's important to understand is that interestingly enough the way that you reassure yourself is actually through reinforcing that what you're doing isn't good enough yeah does that make sense yeah yeah i think it does and so what impact does it have objectively on your life when you work harder [Music] and not good i don't feel like i do much with that mindset okay i [Music] the most i think the the only thing i i i do is that sabotage me and start with loops of anxiety and and and just don't doing much or or grinding grinding something that that is not really has a value for me and and don't make me feel like proud good okay so i mean not that that's good but i'm glad you understand that so let's think about that so if this mindset creates more anxiety for you doesn't really sustainably improve your life what does it give you to adopt that mindset why do you do it um i think it's my way to try and find an answer to to the question of is this is this good or is not good very good right so so what i'm hearing is that even though working harder doesn't actually potentially do a lot for you what it does is it at least reassures you that or it it quiets down the feelings that you're not doing a good job right because if you're grinding then that sort of counters the idea that i'm not doing a good job yeah and i feel like at least i'm doing something very good and and the thing with that is that i i do a lot of things because i do a lot of things i like doing a lot of things but i think doing a lot of things sometimes doesn't let me do the things that i really want to do or not want to do but i really yeah just to do to have um achieve an objective or or something that i i i want to do in life so i often find myself doing a lot of things that it's not that i dislike them but uh doing a lot of things to to to keep me um [Music] quiet in my mind the thought that i'm not doing anything to to like do a better shot so yeah so i want i want you to kind of i'm tempted to just grab my ipad can you hold on a second yeah of course i almost want to try to draw this out for you tom is that okay yeah of course um so let me ask you uh just one or two other questions while i'm setting this up um how do you how do you feel about yourself lately the last couple of years i really improved on myself and my self image i make a lot of change to to to be and feel in the way that a lot of time wanted to to be and feel so i i feel mostly good with myself uh a a lot better that i that it was all my my childhood and most of my life but yeah to yeah i feel good with myself but i am in this uh search of uh trying to improve uh all all these this kind of things a lot uh yeah i i feel like i'm on a on no on a road too but yeah okay so let's let you can see what i'm sharing with you i'll give you a second uh yeah okay so your concern is that you're not able to be validated by other people right yep and you're not a so so let's say you have doubt so you're not sure whether you're doing a good job an income someone else with a validation and what happens is that bounces right off it doesn't actually sink in with me so far yeah yes okay so then what happens is when you have doubt you do an internal exploration and then the internal exploration concludes one of two things or actually not doing a good job sorry not doing a good job or work harder with me so far yeah i'm sorry my handwriting is so bad so when you work harder does this actually improve things it doesn't actually improve things but what it does is offers some reinforcement or some alleviation so you do get a positive that at least i'm doing something you with me yeah okay so that that sort of decreases the doubt a little bit let's actually change our color here to green okay now the problem is that the way that you're managing this doubt is by working inefficiently do you see this is the only thing that actually helps yeah and even then the idea of working harder you only need to work harder if you're not doing a good job in the first place right yeah so and and i think you've done a really good job of sort of discovering that the core of the issue is that other people's validation or reassurance doesn't actually work you with me yes because if this worked if this did not bounce off then the doubt could be alleviated you wouldn't have to end up wasting your time doing work that isn't important and then like everything would be fine right yeah now the other thing that's very very important is that you you have done therapy which is really good and it was interesting that you just jumped right there but then you're sort of recalling these experiences with toxicity in the household and then your mom would reassure you and what would she say everything's okay and that's basically a lie right yeah she would lie to you and tell you everything is okay so what is the lesson that you learned yeah when when what somebody tell me it's it is all good it may not and it probably won't be so this is how you learned how to reject validation yeah okay now yeah there's another thing that we haven't really talked about which is where is the source of this doubt so do you have a sense of why do you think you're not doing a good job in the first place um i don't know if that i i start thinking that way but there is situation that you have to like question yourself if you are doing a good job or not doing a good job so i think that's when i handed out but i think that that doubt just followed me on each aspect of my life yeah so where does that doubt come from i'm not sure okay so now this is going to be kind of interesting so i'm going to give you sort of a different kind of perspective so we've got two options so if we look at this what do we need to do we need to either allow you to be validated or we need to figure out where the source of the doubt came from does that make sense because if the validation works okay then you don't need to do this internal exploration you don't need to work harder and you don't believe you're doing a bad job right that fixes the problem so let me ask you something what's your relationship with your mom like um very close actually and it is good these last years i've been working on uh yeah starting it was really really good relationship until a couple of years that i started to think a little a little bit more about these things and therapy helped me to to uh get to know this this this cycle that my mom have to be always telling me that it's all good and it's all perfect i started to stop uh relying on on my mom telling me that it's all good to to to live life um and i think that yeah i a lot of communication went there but i think overall it's a good relationship okay have you talked to her about have y'all ever talked about how you grew up and what she used to say to you yeah like a few weeks ago i had the courage to to to ask them how how she felt and what's the perspective on all these uh was really difficult um but it wasn't difficult because she weren't she weren't listening or and anything like that she's a really really open person and that can't hear what i what i feel and and i i value that a lot but it was really really difficult for me uh because all recent this uh this past trauma uh so yeah um so what what happened when you so you asked her like hey when when i grew up like there was all this fighting going on there was a lot of toxicity and you you kept telling me that everything was okay what did she say she said that she understand that um basically said like she she didn't invalidate my feeling she said like i understand that uh instead that you feel that way um sorry for that being my own my only way of dealing with things because i was dealing too with my sister that had other problems uh so yeah that's basically that she choose to to to put me on a side and protect me from that uh toxic place because she felt it was the best option at that time okay okay hold on a second okay okay okay okay good good good good okay so let's understand a couple of things so first of all tom you're making it easy for me my friend i'm sorry no this is great i really love it so this is something i really love about our community is um um as so this is great because like basically i want to say two years ago if someone had called in the first thing what we would have sort of gotten to was the fact that you learned to not trust validation right so why do you why do you not why do you reject validation because you essentially learned to not trust validation so if anyone out there is struggling to be in finding that they reject validation the key thing is that you all need to do the kind of exploration that tom has already done which is figure out when did your mind learn to distrust validation and you've already done that you figured that out in therapy so the second thing is that in order to start healing from distrusting validation what one of the key ways that you can do is have a conversation with mom and you've already done that where you talk to your mom and you say hey like you have to acknowledge that she was telling you things and she has to own it too and the good news is when she owns it and she says yes i was i was reassuring you she wasn't actually validating you she was reassuring you we'll get to that in a second i was reassuring you and that reassurance was false because actually what she did in this conversation is validate you does that make sense okay uh okay yeah right because you said hey mom by the way when we grew up you told me everything was gonna be okay and everything was not okay and she didn't say oh no no everything is gonna be fine everything is okay everything is okay everything is okay she says no no no you were correct there was a problem this is the that was the best i could do at the site at the time i'm sorry okay yeah that is actually validation so this is important to understand what you're rejecting is reassurance so when you go to work and you say hey i don't think i'm doing a great job and people reassure you they say no no no everything is okay everything is okay everything is okay that's what your mom used to say do you understand yeah that's strong but yeah what do you mean that's strong um not strong that hard to like sinking yep okay good i mean that's that's okay right it's it's it's heavy is that yeah the the the the phrase everything is okay it is still uh heavy for me to to hurt and all that i'm i'm with you i'm with you it's going to be heavy right because yeah because uh just a little bit perfect i i think that i i speak you something that was a really chewed up but to to even acknowledge that i have that toxic environment was a really hard process and leads to a lot of depression and month of not being able to live life so i think that right now i'm on a point that i have things a lot more chewed up uh but yeah it is kind of still hard to to go back to them can you help me understand what you were saying chewed up uh yeah cheer up sorry no that's fine like yeah like uh um i i've been processing the thing a lot so that's what i mean okay so it's not it's not like super raw in my mind okay okay good so i i think i think you're on the right track how does how does it feel when i say that tom yeah i feel i feel that way actually okay um i think that i i don't have much practical uh tools to deal with with this and how to like do something about it uh but yeah i understand the process and on all these that you told me is very very helpful uh so can we talk about that for a second yes so you're concerned so you you're concerned that you don't have practical tips and that you may not be able to make progress with that is that is that right uh i think kinda but that gets me some time sometimes i just trust that things that are in my mind will be helping me uh improve these things but sometimes i feel like i need specific things to like do or change to to get better yeah that's that sounds so hard because on the one hand you've i'm hearing you sort of say that you've recognized that you've made some progress and that your mind is moving in the right direction and at the same time i'm also hearing like almost like a fear that if you don't do something very practical and someone doesn't lay it out for you like what if it isn't enough yeah that's exactly it how are you feeling right now when i say that uh i feel like yeah acknowledging my fear this is it it's fearful like to try to to change and to trust somebody that that like care about me telling me that it is so good and i really want to to be able to trust that and i'm really want to work on that and sometimes not feeling like i have any tool or things to do to grasp on it's like ugh yeah give me fear yeah oh yeah i mean because because what i'm even your side there was really important because what i'm hearing is that like this needs to be fixed it's really important yeah right like you really need to work on this but what if you don't have the right tools that sounds scary oh yeah sorry if i i get emotional i know but no i'm yeah so now i want you to pay attention tom what are you feeling right now uh i'm kind of up to cry but yeah i feel like what's making you want to cry the fear of not being able to to live life lasting when somebody told me like it is good and yeah yeah so now i i'm i'm doing something that's a little bit tricky with you right now i don't know if you're realizing that tom do you see do you recognize what i'm doing uh i'm not sure no i'm validating you how does it feel uh i feel good if you actually feel hurt and um but you're you're feeling fear how's that going yeah i think um i mean yeah what what gives me fear is the these thoughts that run in my mind about how i will be dealing with this but the conversation and how i feel uh talking to you and you telling me like uh it should be difficult feeling the way you feel that's make me feel uh a lot of relief and like it's right here right so yeah so now we're gonna yeah sorry go ahead yeah yeah i feel heard and like okay yeah so now we're gonna try the opposite tom you ready tom yeah i think with all the therapy and everything that you're doing and you're calling in i think you're gonna be fine i think everything is gonna be okay you're working on yourself you're gonna be great you have nothing to worry about okay how does that feel it's it's good i i sometimes feel the same and i feel like i i don't have much of a problem but not in a diminishing way is more not just trust the process and and trust me uh but yeah it feels good it feels good in what way in a way that yeah i i do you believe me uh i think i want to but the fear about that not being real it's it's it's there yes so beautifully said i want to right because it's hard for you to say oh like you're calling in right you're talking to dr k it's hard to say dr k you're wrong so so this is this is what i'm pointing out to you is that first of all so beautifully done tom and now i'm going to tell you i honestly do think that you i think you're moving in the right direction i think it's going to be hard for you for a while but if you keep on moving in this direction i'm optimistic that you will continue progressing the way that you have what do you think about that okay yeah i i feel i feel i feel the same on on that i i think that yeah uh being calm and trusting uh all the work that i've done to get here will help me and i should be i should trust that and just yeah working on therapy and all that yeah tom you know what i hear i hear that you've put in a lot of work and you've made a lot of progress that you can be proud of and also that you're afraid that that may not be enough that yeah you really need some kind of practical tip to fix this and that you want you want to be able to trust yourself fully but you're not sure if that's actually going to be enough yeah yeah because there was so much time that i tried like a lot of practical things to do and that led nowhere and once i i really have a click and started therapy and and started acknowledging all the things like i i understood the the process and that i was on but yeah that that feeling that sometimes i need practical thing it doesn't let me truly believe on on all the things that i ain't done that's kind of interesting so you were telling me that you've tried a lot of practical things and they don't seem to work for you yeah but not practical in the in not practical like right now but much uh more a bit more of the um work harder thing okay so a lot of my i'm kind of confused tom so help me understand do you think that the right move is to find practical tips or the right move is to trust yourself and and i think that the the good thing is to trust the process because i feel the process i i really first time in my life that i i feel like things are moving forward when i want to be but i think it's a habit to think like i need to do this and this and this and then maybe i'm better uh yeah i think i need to break that habit to yeah that's so interesting yeah do you so i think this conversation is beautiful tom you know why why because you're convincing me of what the right thing to do is right you're convincing me over the course of this conversation we started out with sort of like oh i can't i can't accept other people's validation i need practical tips what if it's not enough and then now you're telling me well actually like a practical tips haven't really helped very much and i've realized that it's it's old thinking that's been habitually trained but isn't necessarily correct and that i have made a lot of progress by trusting in myself and i've made you know i've had a serious conversation with my mom i've gone to therapy and i'm actually growing as a human being and that's what i need to continue doing yep you sound like you're doing great yep yeah i is it okay to say i'm proud of you yeah of course thank you so much you don't reject that no actually i don't i i feel proud of myself right now wow look at what we just did yeah that's really it i'm proud of you too i'm tearing up i didn't think you were going to be able to be proud of yourself yeah it feels good yeah it really does like i'm feeling like i'm feeling hurt i've got like a lump in my throat but i feel very proud of you and i'm i'm so happy that you're on this journey yeah but i feel hurt inside i don't understand why why were you expecting something different i mean so usually i feel pride i don't feel hurt i think maybe what i'm feeling is like i actually am feeling an acknowledgement of actually like how much you've suffered and i can be proud that you're making progress but it's also like you didn't start from a good place right and you've been working really really really hard and there's a part of me that almost feels like you should have deserved to start in a normal place and if you had worked this hard you would have ended up very very successful and happy i think there's a part of me that's sad because even after working so hard you're just like getting to be normal yeah and that feels really unfair to me yeah i i actually think about that sometimes it's like i can see my potential on so many things and i know that i'm strong enough to accomplish things that are meaningful to me but sometimes i found like a drag it down because of all this work i have to do on something that i don't say that it shouldn't have happened but it is a shame that happened uh yeah i understand that yeah can i share just one or two other small thoughts with you just something for you to think about of course so we talked a little bit about i just want to kind of fill in this chart so you already had a conversation with your mom i think that's really really important another thing that i want you to consider doing is trying to validate other people i know we talked about that a little bit yeah but i don't want you to reassure them right if someone is struggling around you in order to learn how to validate properly and how to accept validation sometimes it can help to try to support other people okay just practice it okay yeah i've been yeah i've been trying to be uh more open with with my relationships and try to talk a bit more about things that happen in in in their lives and yeah this is a good thing for you to tell me i will be you happy with the practical tip yeah okay so can you can you quickly outline me the difference between validation and reassurance beautiful to just like have it in my mind right now absolutely so this is something that um we teach all of our coaches therapists learn this as well so validating is acknowledging someone else's experience reassurance is actually telling everyone that it'll be okay okay there's a big difference so reassurance is like before you do a judgment but no so reassurance is actually telling it's invalidating because if you tell me tom that i'm really struggling and you know everything in my life is hard and i say to you no no everything's fine you're brilliant you're okay everyone at work tells you you're doing a good job that's not actually validating it's actually invalidating because i'm saying you're wrong right i understand you're you're foolish for believing that everything is not okay so reassurance is oftentimes actually invalidating yeah the weird thing and you may have remembered this is that when you validate someone even though you're telling them yeah you should be afraid and you may have remembered this from a few moments ago you actually feel better even though you're acknowledging the fear right it's kind of weird because wait you're telling me that i i should i it's okay to be afraid yeah like if you're afraid like you're not an idiot right but oddly enough so what what validation really does is a lot of people think that if i acknowledge someone's negative emotions i'm going to reinforce them yeah right i'll make it worse but actually when someone is feeling afraid and uh when they're feeling afraid part of what they're feeling is alone and when you reassure them you actually make them feel more alone whereas when you validate them at least like even if you're like i'm not saying that everything in your life is going to be easy in fact what i'm saying is that i think it's really sad that you had to deal with this stuff this feels really unfair to me and yet when i say something like that because your actual problems don't change right no matter what i say your life is going to be your life the difference is are you alone in it and what validation really helps people do is acknowledge that negativity face that negativity not feel alone in it and then that actually helps them feel better and then i don't know i i'd recommend that you go back and you watch the vaude but like you kind of flipped over the course of this conversation okay yeah i will and and you were sort of talking about oh i have all these problems and like i don't know if it's going to be enough and like i need practical tips and all this kind of stuff and then like towards the end of the conversation you're kind of saying oh but actually like i used to do a lot of practical tips and the practical tips actually feel like working harder and that actually doesn't help and what i really need to do is trust myself and when you say things like i should trust myself that's what we call confidence and so over the course of this conversation you've actually become more confident yeah the last thing that i want to share does that answer your question yeah the last thing that i want to share with you okay is when you're in a situation and your mom says everything is okay let's say this is reality this is gonna be kind of confusing okay i just don't know how to and your mom says everything is okay sometimes what happens is our mind will have to balance that out with doubt does that make sense yeah yeah because you are you know that reality is not that sight right so when you and your mom have this kind of conversation i've seen this a lot where when people don't acknowledge reality and one person pretends that everything is okay it's almost like the burden of this reality is shared between you and your mom and it sounds like your mom used a coping mechanism which is pretending everything is okay and trying to convince the world that everything is okay and sometimes what we see in kids when parents use this coping mechanism is the kid actually has to balance that with an appropriate amount of doubt because you can't trust your mom right so then like i i know it sounds kind of weird but and so when we're thinking about the origins of your doubt sometimes i've seen this kind of thing where when a child grows up with an overly reassuring parent what they actually learn how to do is doubt doubt doubt doubt doubt it's almost like the opposite of copium because your mom is like you know copium yeah okay so so that's just something for you to kind of think about i i think it's really healthy that you had one conversation with your mom and i want you to just think a little bit about where you learn to doubt and what the relationship between your mom's perspective that everything is okay is and your doubt okay okay sounds good yeah sounds good very good how you holding up tom i i'm good i'm good actually i feel a lot more uh relief um and i i i think that this talk helped me acknowledge the the conflict that is in my mind between trusting myself and the process and wanting to fix things with tips and yeah it really helped me to understand the difference between validation reassurance and recognizing that i think it will help me help me a lot uh validating new people and understanding when some for somebody is validating on or invalidating by dating me uh that was really helpful yeah tom i also want to say i i can i'm assuming that english isn't your first language because you have an accent and stuff but you're very very good at organizing your thoughts and summarizing i very much appreciate that thank you so much that's really good to hear good any last questions before we wrap up um no i don't think i have any any more questions okay thank you so much for for your help for your time thank you very much for calling in i i i hope a lot of people were able to learn from your experience yes take care buddy bye so let's do a quick summary so it's kind of tricky because sometimes we reject other people's reassurance right so we doubt something in ourselves and what we'll naturally do is we'll turn to other people and we'll sort of be like okay like hey like am i doing a good job at work is it okay like am i a good friend am i a good partner and just no matter what they say like even if they reassurance reassure us we'll ask for reassurance but the moment they reassure us we'll actually reject it so where does that actually come from interestingly enough it comes from oftentimes somewhere along the way our mind learns that other people can't be trusted and sometimes is in the case of tom like what we really saw is that there's like a really good reason why they're able to do that and so a lot of this comes down to really understanding what the difference between validation and reassurances and how putting our heads in the sand and ignoring problems actually does not work so you know really beautiful case of someone who struggles to receive validation and reassurance from others and trying to understand where that really comes from so if we like sort of ask people for reassurance and end up rejecting it it turns out that we're not fundamentally busted it turns out that somewhere along the way our brain learned to distrust what other people say about us and so overcoming that actually involves a couple of different things understanding where the origin of your own doubt is understanding how your brain was conditioned to reject what other people say and ultimately understanding the difference between validation and reassurance
