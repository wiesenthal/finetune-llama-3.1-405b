if you're a boy or man you kind of understand what I'm talking about that we are raised to be independent we are taught that Independence and dependence are at two opposite ends of the spectrum and the more that you ask for help the more dependent you become whereas in actuality help seeking can foster Independence today we're going to talk about how to ask for help now this may sound a little bit strange because there is so much in the world that is rapidly evolving there's AI there are designer strains of THC and marijuana and of course there's all Neuroscience changes with the way that technology is interfering with our brain and there's dopamine and the evils of dopamine and the gluten watch out for the gluten there's so many problems in life but today we're going to talk about something that is so simple and yet so difficult for especially half of the population especially men which is asking for help and it is crazy but a lot of men out there don't know how to ask for help and a lot of the problems that we face today I think are due to a fundamental inability to ask other human beings for support it turns out that asking for help is not just a natural thing that we do there's actually a social and cognitive skills expertise involved with asking for help much like making friends or learning to apologize properly or even things like flirt asking for help is actually a social skill that most men lack and today we are going to focus a little bit more on men because it turns out that the literature shows that especially when it comes to help-seeking behavior men are at some sort of disad advantage and this sort of makes sense if you're a boy or man you kind of understand what I'm talking about that we are raised to be independent and as independent and capable men the last thing that we want to do is ask for help now this is a huge problem because help seeking is actually a critical human skill of communication just like something like flirting or how to interview for a job properly they're particular ways to ask for help and today we're going to dive into that now some of the research that we're going to be looking at is specifically towards men because this is more of a masculine problem but one of the things that I'm seeing as a clinician is that the gender divide between men and women when it comes to mental health is actually shrinking so I've seen more and more women recently who struggle with the same problem or non-binary persons so my hope is that this will be helpful for everyone who watches it hey all' if you're interested in applying some of the principles that we share to actually create change in your life check out Dr K's guide to mental health it combines over two decades of my experience of both being a monk and a psychiatrist and distills all of the most important things I've learned into a Choose Your Own Adventure format so check out the link in the bio and start your journey today so let's start with some Basics around help seeking so it turns out that there are two ways to ask for help one way to ask for help is actually goal directed and leads to Independence over time it is the acquisition of a skill which then allows you to do it without someone else's help on the flip side everyone is afraid of asking asking for help because of the downsides of it well if I ask for help I'm dependent on this person I don't want to be dependent on this person I should learn how to do it myself and if we're not careful help-seeking can actually lead to dependency so we're going to tease these two apart so let's start by understanding bad help seeking so when we seek help for negative reasons it turns out that it Fosters our dependence and keeps us from being independent and bad help-seeking has a couple of qualities the first is that bad help is characterized by trying to avoid the task in some way if I don't feel like doing something I can ask for help so that someone else messes with it related to this if you look at themes of sort of negative help-seeking sometimes when we want to put something behind us we will lean into bad help-seeking behaviors I'm tired of dealing with this crap I want to just get it behind me I want to avoid the task I don't want to bother with it so I will basically dump this responsibility on someone else so anytime you're asking for help really stop and think a little bit about why are you asking for help are you doing it for the reason of avoidance are you trying to avoid a particular thing there are two other reasons that read to bad help seeking so one is avoidance of criticism so the other reason that people may ask for help is because they're afraid if I do it myself what will people think what will people say will I end up being criticized so help seeking can be a form of ego protection and that leads us to the last bad reason to ask for help which is actually to avoid comprehension or Mastery some human beings will take a particular skill and end up saying you know what I just don't want to learn how to do this I don't want to organize the pantry I don't want to learn how to put together a presentation for a group project this does not seem valuable to me so instead what I'm going to do is dump this responsibility on someone else by asking for help now if y'all have been paying attention to these reasons you'll notice a couple of common themes a big one is avoidance this is something that I'm not interested in learning not interested in growing not interested in exposing myself to the task and the second big thing is a shifting of responsibility so instead of taking responsibility for this task I'm essentially dumping it on someone else which is exactly how we move to healthy help-seeking so if you look at studies from the 1970s this was super cool but they to took a group of teachers and they asked them what do you see when you see kids asking for help and these teachers basically noticed the same dichotomy that they said that actually the kids who ask for help are more likely to be goal oriented and more likely to be independent over time and that teachers are very supportive of kids asking for help and that's because help-seeking is actually a problemsolving strategy to gain independence so in medical school we have this very very simple saying that we say which is see one do one teach one so in med school when you're working in the hospital the first thing that you do is you learn from someone else I'm going to learn how to I'm going to watch someone put in an IV line and then what I'm going to do is I'm going to do an IV line by S I'm going to be observed while I insert an IV and then hopefully I will teach someone else how to insert an IV after that if I've been paying attention now with something specifically like putting in you know an IV line or a central line we have to be observed a couple number of times and it's not quite that easy but that really uh that really captures a certain attitude of help-seeking which is that help seeking can be used to Foster Independence and this is what we see on studies of children is that some kids will ask for help right they're like I don't know how to do this thing will you help me do this thing and once the teacher shows them how to do this thing then the child then engages in independent Behavior I no longer need your help so if we pay attention what we'll find is that some help seeking is simply a step to Independent Mastery and there's a great example of this that we're all familiar with which is mentorship so even when I was starting healthy gamer I went to a lot of my mentors like the chief of Psychiatry at Mass General Hospital the chief of Psychiatry at mlan hospital the president of the American Psychiatric association I went to a lot of these people and I said will you help me I have this concern that technology addiction is a huge problem and I want to do something about it will you help me figure out what I can do about it and this is what's really interesting about mentorship if you really pay attention to what it is it is asking for help almost preemptively you are proactively asking for people's help and guidance while you Garner Independence and this is critical to understand especially if you're a dude so when we're growing up as boys and men in a lot of women like I said I've seen this a lot more in women recently as well is that when we're grow growing up we are taught that Independence and dependence are at two opposite ends of the spectrum and the more that you ask for help the more dependent you become whereas in actuality help seeking can foster Independence and it turns out that even if you study teenage children what you find is a very interesting dichotomy so if you ask teenage kids is asking for help okay the answer is it depends if you ask for help from your parents then that is not okay now you're a noob now you're someone who's always running to mommy and daddy for help we actually view that negatively but teenagers who ask other teenagers for help are actually viewed positively so even though we all sort of think that help leads to emotional dependence or dependence it turns out that many people teachers and teenagers see help seeking in a particular or in a potentially positive light so now let's get to some of the more concrete stuff so what is it that makes asking for help difficult it's not just this issue of okay if I ask for help I'm independent but if you look at studies on men specifically it turns out that there are a couple of reasons why it is very difficult for men to ask for help and this also creates a cycle because if it is difficult for us to ask for help that means that we don't practice asking for help and if we don't practice asking for help then what ends up happening is finally we're desperate we're unskilled and we are forced to ask for help and since we don't know the skill of it then when we end up asking for help it doesn't go well people don't give us the the help that we need we're not even able to articulate what kind of help we need and even the amount of help that they give us seems to not be enough or makes us feel really bad about ourselves so this is something that's so critical but we sort of don't really we're not really taught how to do it and then when we finally give it a shot it doesn't end up working well and when it doesn't end up working well we do not reinforce that behavior then we sort of realize and this is the experience of a lot of men when I ask for help I just get burned it's a waste of time it doesn't end up helping anyway so I'm not going to bother in order to reverse that we have to understand the things that make it difficult to ask for help and then sort of set up a system to successfully ask for help so let's start with a little bit of research why didn't you just ask underestimating the discomfort of help seeking so the first thing that we've got to understand is that asking for help is not easy in fact it is very hard there are a lot of internally emotionally difficult things that keep us from asking for help and until we understand what those are we cannot successfully ask for help so now let's take a look at some of the things that um cause problems so this is a paper called the the role of masculinity in men's help seeking for depression a systematic review and then what is the impact of mental health related stigma on help-seeking a systematic review of quantitative and qualitative studies so some of this is men specific some of this applies to everybody so the first thing difficulty communicating recognizing or understanding depression the notion that men are socially conditioned not to engage in emotion-based communication and consequently experience difficulty employing such language was a recurring theme in 82% of studies okay it was suggested that help-seeking is often hindered by a limited emotional vocabulary in men which is maladaptive in therapeutic contexts we don't do very well asking for help because we don't know how to communicate so I'll give you all a classic example when I talk to my male friends or when I when I talk to my male friends and I'm talking about the help that I need or I'm listening to them ask for help they use very limited vocabulary they'll say things like oh I'm stressed I'm frustrated I'm overwhelmed now here's the crazy thing about that I want youall to think about that when someone says I'm stressed what are you supposed to do is this person asking for your assistance do they want help with the stress what part of the stress do they want help with what does the ask for you you don't know I I don't know they're just stressed are they just venting a negative emotion are they looking to just say I'm stressed and then they we're going to talk about it for a little while do they want a shoulder to cry on do they want an ear to that listens to them like what are they looking for when they say stressed and especially for men often times when we say stressed what we're really looking for or what we're asking for is someone to distract us from our stress I actually don't want to talk about my problems I don't need your help in it I need a buddy to go get hammered with or I need a bud to go play video games with let's go dumpster some noobs so this is the first problem when it comes to help-seeking especially if you're a man which is that often times we don't know how to communicate effectively we're incredibly vague with our language we ourselves don't realize what kind of help we need and so it puts people in a very difficult situation where when you say I'm stressed overwhelmed what is that person supposed to do they have no idea and what that sort of means is it's kind of really tricky because if they have no idea what to do you're not giving them a frame to help you it makes it difficult for them to help you and the harder you make it for someone else to help you the less likely you are to ask for help and if you don't ask for help and they don't know how to help then you end up saying this is absolutely a mess it's never going to work nothing good comes of it anyway so I'm done and then we lead to a life of loneliness isolation and eventually getting crushed because life is a multiplayer Co-op game human beings have evolved to help each other out and as a man if you don't know how to get help from other human beings you are playing at a huge disadvantage the second problem that men run into is that they often times try to limit their disclosure so this is where if someone if I'm asking for help from someone what I usually want to do is show them the tiniest amount of whatever I need help with because if I need help that is incredibly embarrassing it's pathetic that I wasn't able to fix this on my own and now I'm such a loser for needing your help so instead of asking for the full range of help what I will actually do is I will limit my disclosure I will try to ask for the tiniest little thing instead of telling people oh I lost my job three months ago and I've been living off of my savings I will ask for the tiniest little loan right I will try to protect other people from everything that is going on in my life hey bro can I borrow a couple 100 bucks and that I don't tell them that the problem is actually a lot larger because I feel embarrassed and if I don't tell them the problem is a lot larger even if they help me that help will be insufficient right so this means that I'm asking for a couple hundred bucks and then what happens a couple weeks later I need a few hundred more and then a few hundred more and then a few hundred more because instead of actually telling them the scope of my problem I don't want to feel bad for burdening them so I try to limit my disclosure as much as possible not give people context and therefore even if they do give help it is insufficient so it is it is a strategy that ends up failing before it even begins so we need to be a little bit better about not limiting disclosure quite as much okay and we'll teach you all how to do that too then we get to the third basic problem that men have when asking for help which is that they use help as a last resort so I'm going to try to fix this problem on my own I'mma do it myself I'm a man I'm an independent I don't need no one's help so I'm going to fix it on my own I'm going to fix it on my own I'm going to fix it on my own problem gets gets worse worse worse worse worse and then since I've tried everything while the problem is getting worse then when I have nothing no options left then I will finally ask for help but this too is a self-defeating strategy Because by the time you ask for help things are such a mess that your friends don't even know where to start now I'm I've been jobless for 3 months I'm about to be homeless I got dumped by my partner I'm addicted to this substance everything is falling apart and you don't know where to start and if you don't know where to start you break down and you tell your friend everything is going wrong I'm suicidal and then your friend is like I don't know what to do with this we don't have a focused ask because your life is such a mess sometimes because you waited till the last minute to ask for help that it creates a situation that seems unsolvable so now that we know what the problems are we're going to teach yall a strategy to successfully ask for help now this strategy involves a couple of key components the first is that the strategy should feel good to you remember that we have all these ideas about how asking for help makes me a loser these problems are too big to start or uh to fix or whatever so we need something that is going to be emotionally okay for you to ask the second thing that we want to do is provide enough context to prevent that limited disclosure to help people understand what the scope of this is without sounding pathetic and then the last thing is to ask in a strategic way so that people are actually more likely to help you so this involves actually just three to six sent sentences that are broken down into three categories okay so the first category is a little bit of context let people know in just one to two sentences you don't need a trauma dump about what is the scope of what you're dealing with so let's say we're looking for a job so I can go to my friends and I can say hey I've been out of work for about 3 months I really would like to get a new job and I was hoping that you could help me a little bit so this is where you're starting off with just offering some context okay I've been out of job for a couple of months I need some kind of help second thing that we want to do is actually take responsibility and share with people what we've done this is critical okay so the second sentence is going to be something like I've applied to 400 jobs over the last three months and I've also tried going to one job fair but despite doing all of this work I have not been able to find a job so now you are signaling to this person that you are taking responsibility and by the way if we look at likelihood of someone else to help you the more that you take responsibility for your situation the more likely someone else is to help you so when I'm working as a psychiatrist and the patient comes into my office and they're like Dr K I've been addicted to pornography for so long I've tried this I've tried this I've tried this I've tried this please will you help me I'm much more likely to say absolutely because I can see that this person has put in a lot of effort and we as human beings we've evolved to help humans who are not lazy so in our second to third sentence what we really want to focus on is this is is what I have done so far now if you have done nothing what you want to do is take a moment to try to do something so that when you ask for help you can tell someone hey this is where I've started okay so you want to own up what you've done the next thing that you want to do is then we get to the actual help-seeking where you want to be very very specific with your ask so context is I've been out of a job for 3 months taking responsibilities I've applied for 400 jobs I've been to one job fair and then we need to be specific with our ask so what do we want this person to do I was hoping you could review my resume and let me know if I'm missing something cuz I've applied for 400 jobs and I haven't gotten really any hits can you play please take a look at my resume and the next thing is you can even ask something else can you also introduce me let's say I'm applying for jobs as an underwater basket Weaver can you please ask anyone in your community if they know of any openings right so we're asking for two particular pieces of help reviewing your resume and checking your network for someone who may be able to help me in some way do you know anyone that I could talk to that may be able to help me right so you can ask that very specific thing and if you break these three things down into this format right where you add some context so we don't need to limit our disclosure we don't need to hide but we also don't need to trauma dump then what we want to do is take responsibility this is what I have done so far but it's not working for these these and these reasons and then the last thing is this is the help that I am asking you for can you help me do these two two things so when you structure things this way first of all it's like a total of five to six sentences right so it'll take you like a minute or two they sort of understand what the point is and you're asking for a very particular ask so it makes it actionable for them and then once they act upon it that'll also help you feel good because now they're helping you out you're not quite as alone but you're also not becoming dependent you're not asking them to find you a job for you right you're doing the bulk of the work and then they are helping you in some way and even when we go back to this research on kids and teachers and things like that this is exactly what we see that a lot of people who ask for help are actually striving for Independence and if you ask in this way if you ask them to review your resume and then they review it and you're like okay I see you made these these these changes now you've increased your competence sum so you won't need their help quite as much in the future now there's one last thing to consider when it comes to help seeking which is another psychological trick which both increases your ability to ask for help and someone's ability to give you help it makes it easier on both sides is to be new so anytime we have a novice if you just look at the science of help-seeking anytime someone is new at something it makes them more comfortable asking for help and it makes other people more comfortable giving them help so even if there's something that you're you don't feel knew about try to approach it in some sort of new way hey I've been working in this field for six years but I'm trying a new slightly different take on a on a job Ro I've been working in human resources and benef benefits management but now I want to move more into the HR and like Executive coaching realm and if you frame things to yourself that way right so I've I've gone I've applied for 400 jobs online but I've never visited a job fair I've never done networking before so going to someone else and saying hey I've done this before but I'm trying something new I'm trying networking for the first time can you help me so if you literally use those two statements if you do something if you frame something as new it'll make it easier for you to receive help without your ego getting in the way and people are more likely to help people who are new at something and they're novices right if a friend of yours comes to you and says hey I'm trying to learn this new game will you teach me how would you respond to that versus someone who says hey will you you know we've been playing together can you give me some pointers like there's a there's a subtle but important psychological difference between the two so it's kind of sad but one of the biggest problems that men run into is that we're socialized against asking for help and the less that we ask for help the more our help seeking skills atrophy which is absolutely a social skill as we get worse at asking for help then the rare occasions when we are desperate and we finally ask end up asking for help we end up asking in a way that's way too vague where we don't tell people the full story because we're so ashamed of ourselves and we don't even have a clear ask so they don't really know what to do with it then that results in I mustered up all this courage to ask for help and I didn't even get anything that then negatively reinforces me as asking for help I decide I'm never going to ask for help I'm going to do it myself right so we don't want to do that so in order to change that around in order to take advantage of the help that other human beings will offer you because life is a Co-op multiplayer game right like that's how it works we need to understand these factors and hopefully if youall adopt this structure of context plus responsibility plus specific ask you will be able to get some help in life and stop playing this MMO is a single player RPG la [Music]
