so what the ego does is it doesn't compare one person to one person it compares you to the best aspects of a dozen people so it's creating a situation in which you can never win hello friend hello hi hi how are you i'm doing fine how are you doing doctor i'm doing well can you tell me what you go by my friend yes uh my name is kami okay nice to meet you kami nice to meet you as well and what's holding you back well what's holding me back is the fear of underachieving basically in nowadays can you tell me about being able to yeah i'm not being able to reach my goals okay and and so can you help me understand why you're afraid that you'll under achieve the goal the end goal the point that i'm supposed to reach in my head is way higher above than what looks reachable i don't know if i made it understandable but imagine you're climbing let's like let's say a tree but the tree you cannot see the end of the tree you can't reach the top of the tree so even looking at it just makes you want to stop you know why even try there's no end point okay um so let me ask you a couple of questions what makes you think that you're going to underachieve what makes you think you won't get to the top of the tree okay well looking at it might okay i should give a little background on myself please um i finished medical school i'm a general practitioner right now i've worked for a year i decided i wanted to go into research to have a better you know to have a better academic life so i started looking at phds so i started i found something that i really liked as a research topic i started getting into it but i'm looking at like the names that do research in that topic and the difference between them and me is just seems like un unapproachable that their point is so i'm 25 i've been studying for 19 years in my life and it just feels like i'm just starting to get into it so i've been doing this for 19 years what is the point where am i getting with this am i going to study for another 40 years and at the end of those 40 years what am i going to do what's gonna happen okay thank you so much for offering that context yes so yeah i haven't made it clear at the beginning no no it was very clear yeah i i was you know i i think you were pretty clear that let me just can i think for a second yes yes so what what makes you want to do research i basically want to do something that people haven't done i want to find something that nobody has ever found i just want to do something new i just want to add something why i want to have a impact i want to have a memory of myself after i die you want to be remembered yeah i want to be remembered okay um what makes you want to be remembered i'm not the biggest person when it comes to believing in afterlife so what we do here is going be left here so whatever i do even even you know studying in medicine when you read the names when you learn about people i look at them and i see them as let's say guidance like you see the name and you look at what they did and they're inspiring i want to inspire i can be like a you know little name somewhere but even 10 people can read it and if it's inspiring to someone okay do you feel like so do you commie do you feel insignificant right now i i do feel insignificant how long have you felt i mean so far always since you were six i'd say mostly started around like elementary school thinking about it just looking at other kids because like what i always did was compare that was that was the way that i looked at my own success i compared myself to the other kids in class my friends for example one of my closest friends was really good at gaming i always compared my gaming skills to him one of my friends was really good at sports i compared my sports skills to him i always wanted to be better i always wanted to be like the top that's what i always tried to do that just went on forever even in medical school i tried to do a lot of things i just jumped from one branch to another branch but at the end of the day i didn't finish anything okay so now looking forward just going forward thinking about it i'm just gonna if i get accepted to the phd program that i'm thinking i'm gonna go to the phd what's gonna happen after phd maybe postdoctoral maybe residency i'm gonna finish that then what's gonna happen maybe i'll do research maybe i'll do clinic and then what's gonna happen nothing nothing is happening at the end i don't see the end of the line so i'm starting to work i'm always trying to be better at something i'm doing that's the goal i'm trying to be better at what i'm doing i'm comparing myself to other people i'm trying to see what's approachable i'm trying to get better and better and better but i don't see the end point am i just gonna spend my whole life trying to be better at what i'm doing is this the goal sounds like it how does that what is to accomplish from this you tell me what am i you're the one who wants it what is my yeah what is my six-year-old self gonna look back and say oh i'm really glad i spent my last like 35 to 40 years studying on this topic yeah so so i mean but you tell me kami so when you're 60 years old and you've spent your youth your middle years your entire life and now they're going to name a disease after you commies autoimmune encephalitis and then all of the all of the medical students after that will learn about kami's autoimmune encephalitis and your name will be in medical textbooks what do you how does that if i tell you that that's what they're gonna do how would you feel about that makes me that makes me feel some a little bit accomplished i feel i did something i can say that i did something at the end of the day i provided something yeah but let me ask you something when when they name a disease after you what is your mind gonna do so thinking about it now you're gonna you imagine you'll feel accomplished but when you reach that point do you think that's how you're gonna feel at this point if you ask me yes okay good but when i reach that point i cannot say for sure for now why are you a doctor i i wanted to do research i wanted to do research so i looked at in what topics i can do research and i saw that medicine was the most interesting one for me okay do you feel accomplished in being a doctor just being a general practitioner doesn't feel accomplishing okay so it feels like it's not enough that's what i mean by underachieving yeah i finished medical school but i don't feel enough so so here's so let's understand by the way tommy this is beautiful i mean it's i recognize you're suffering a lot but i think it's beautiful how you're laying out what the challenges you face are is it okay for me to say that yeah yeah okay completely fine so i think the reason that you're under achieving is is actually it's kind of interesting because you call it under achievement whereas you're actually achieving a lot right you're accomplishing a lot it's just not satisfying for you and so what i'm imagining is that when they name kami's autoimmune encephalitis what you're going to do is say well kami's autoimmune encephalitis only affects one in 10 million people whereas this other person who has let's say you know bob's i don't uh i'll try this bob's arthritis right bob's arthritis bob's auto well bob's autoimmune arthritis affects way more people and i just get one line in a textbook whereas this other person's arthritis is all on all the medical exams and is way more common and they spend a whole day talking about it yeah what do you think about that do you think that's a possibility that when you discover something it won't be enough yeah yeah definitely so definitely might not be enough even whatever i do that's that's the biggest fear the fear of not being enough doing this much so far still not be feeling enough and i'm looking at the future there's hopefully if i'm lucky enough i have 40 50 more years to live i'm scared autoimmune encephalitis yeah who knows who knows there are two ways to get diseases named after you my friend yeah true true i can be the patient zero who knows uh but yeah looking at those 40 50 years in the future will i feel accomplished eventually will it be enough is it gonna be am i gonna one day look in there and be like okay you did good that's enough good job what do you think i i feel that's that's my problem i feel it's unachievable i don't see that yeah my father yeah my father is a neurosurgeon he's almost 60. he's been working his whole life and when i talk to him he's still like oh you know what i'll work as long as my hands and my feet allow me to as long as i can do my work i'll work and they seem so unbothered by it how does your dad feel about having a how does a neurosurgeon feel about having a general practitioner as a son he's a he has a different approach than the most commonly seen one even when i was first getting into medical school he told me to do whatever i want he said that he'll support me just pick what you want to do be good at it and i'll support you okay so now when i'm talking about research he says the same thing pick something you like and be good at it and i'll support you all you want so kami let me ask you a different question how does it feel have being a general practitioner and having a neurosurgeon as a father it's it comes with its you know um toughnesses i guess i can say like hard hard parts the military approach to life being up at 5 30 every morning eating breakfast at 6 00 in the morning okay let's let me give you another example for example i wake up at like nine i study i get ready for something that i'm getting ready it's like five i spent my whole day studying for it at five i just lay back in my chair i open up a game i play a little games i just talk to my friends he comes and looks at me and he's like huh so you're you didn't study it all what did you do today and i'm like yeah i studied this is my like chill time i'm just taking like an hour or two off you know i can just chill for a while uh and he's like yeah yeah sure and just walks away now he doesn't mean it as a condescending condescendingly or he means it as a comical as a joke way but when you think about it is it it gives you know i can never be sure well but okay yeah i mean when i talk about my dad i always say the same thing he always supported he always said what do whatever you want to do i'll support and so far i guess it worked out good does it sound like it worked out good i'm just looking at like an outside perspective i had it easier compared to a lot of people when you think about it okay so i mean you don't sound you don't sound happy kami what do you what do you define as happiness though how do you define the happy state is it being happy with your life in what context you are happy happy with my life are you happy not right now there's a lot of uncertainties have have you ever been happy with your life i mean sure in elementary school and maybe high school during medical school i was happy for like two three years help me understand that how are you happy in medical school i liked what i was doing i enjoyed going to classes i enjoyed learning new things i enjoyed my time in medical school okay so but did they name any diseases after you in medical school no not really so help me understand that how could you be happy in medical school and also not be accomplished you were a student yeah i mean it was it was more like okay think about it this way there's six years and the point to panic to to self-realization comes after the fourth grade in here like in my country medical school is six years and we finish it and then we go directly into residency so the first three years i was happy i didn't even know what i was doing there i was completely lost i was like okay this class and then this class oh let me just learn about this a little more this looks interesting after fourth grade you come into the realization of okay what's next okay i'm gonna end this so let me ask you something so i'm gonna use your analogy of climbing a tree all right so for the first couple of years of medical school you were really looking at like the like looking at the tree at the almost at the level that you were on or you're looking at the next branch above you right you can see like where you're supposed to put your hand but essentially you're looking at the level of the tree that you're at and the dread sets in when after year four you looked up and you couldn't see you could see all the hand holds that you've been climbing yeah and you were okay like climbing one hand hold at a time you were happy yeah and then the moment you look up and you realize oh crap like this tree doesn't end that's when you became unhappy exactly that's when it hit me so i guess i can see i i know it sounds kind of weird but like if you want to be happy what should you do that's the problem i'm having i i cannot i cannot figure out what should i just keep on climbing should i just stop and go down i know how the floor was but let me let me toss something out how about stop looking up so just keep on climbing yeah don't question it that much sure how does that feel it feels it it makes me uneasy to not think what's ahead okay and why is that good because it's always been like that you look at the goal you have a goal that you have to reach but i don't see a goal anymore i see that the goal i see goals let's say call it that i see a lot of goals to achieve but i don't see an ending of these goals i've i've achieved some goals i look at my cv and i look at myself i'm like okay i did this and this and this i know that i did these i'm going up i'm setting goals still i'm setting a goal right now for myself to get into a phd next goal is going to be finish that phd i'm still looking at the goals the problem is taking a step back and looking at all that's ahead of me now i feel uneasy without a goal because i don't know what i'm doing then i don't know where i'm going okay it's like like shooting my hand up in the air not knowing if i'm gonna reach that branch can i think for a second coming yeah are you proud of yourself i am proud of myself help me understand that when i think to myself if i did a good job so far getting to this point i did a good job so far i think to myself yes could i could i have done more of course i could have done more there's always more that i could have done but so far i did good i didn't do bad i finished medical school i worked a little i wanted to get in research so i did some research okay and i'm still setting my goals and going there kami so i um thank you so much for sharing everything anything i have a couple of thoughts and we can do a little bit more back and forth but anything that uh you'd like to add or anything that you feel like needs more explanation or anything that we've talked about that frustrates you no not really i mean i can just continue after you basically okay so i think there are a couple of important things here so i think that the challenge the biggest challenge that i see that you face is that a lot of different things are being conflated so if i tell you for example so we know that that you've been happy before right and when you've been happy before is when you've basically been like oblivious and ignorant to what's going on exactly right so if i tell you okay so if you're unhappy kami then just become oblivious again stop looking up and while that may work sort of it's a very unsatisfying answer because like how are you gonna plan your life if you're just like lost in the moment exactly right so so i think there are a couple of different things that are being conflated and and my sense of this situation is that these things need to be teased apart and kind of worked on individually does that make sense the first thing is it sounds to me like you're in an early life crisis have you heard the phrase midlife crisis yeah yeah what's your understanding of what a midlife crisis is basically the realization of the age moving forward and then being scared that the younger days are not gonna come back yep and and does it sort of make sense that you're kind of in an early life crisis is it like having the midlife crisis a little bit too early yeah right so you've you've been you've been grinding for 19 years as you put it and you wake up at the age of 25 and you have accomplishments behind you and somewhere along the way you thought that those accomplishments would make you happy but yeah you're not happy in fact you're terrified yeah and so like you're not sure and basically what i think that what i think of as an early life crisis or a midlife crisis is you play the game of life with a particular strategy assuming that that strategy will be successful and then you hit some point where you realize like wait a minute the strategy is not accomplishing what i want and then you feel terrified because have i been using the wrong strategy and is it too late like if i basically screwed up and then you're really confused because do i continue using the strategy going forward or do i change my strategy but if i change my strategy what if that doesn't work how do i know what i should do because you're telling me like what if i spend the next 40 years doing research and like what if that's not enough what if these other researchers are more brilliant than i am so like does that feel like it fits yeah yeah yeah i understand okay so i think there are two or three different things to understand the first is what is the nature of happiness the second is how to plan your life and the third is ego okay so let's start with the third one ego so why do human beings want to be remembered because they feel insignificant so i could argue with you if i wanted to i don't know how useful it would be but for example like i don't think that general practitioners are insignificant i think you sort of talk about you know being remembered because nothing happens after death whatever that's totally fine but like you know i think general practitioners are some of the most impactful and memorable people because there are real human lives that you are altering the course of you know this person's life which in turn is going to alter the course of all of their family members you know if you find like let's say like you know a shallow depth melanoma in someone where you can do a surgical extraction never you know they never get past stage one cancer you've altered the course of that person's life in a very permanent and meaningful way yeah what do you think about that okay uh the problem i have with that one is it's gonna be still talking about my ego it's gonna be me being egoist about myself but the way i look at it is if i'm not let's say i diagnose and i treat and i change the course of that person's life but if it wasn't me if it was someone else it would have had the same outcome most likely they would still get diagnosed by someone else they'll still get treated by someone else my problem here with this with this one is what can i do that will set me aside from the herd okay what can i accomplish that the other people cannot so as expected i i mean clearly you don't find significance or meaning in that because if you did we wouldn't be having this conversation about being a researcher right so that makes sense that you are that doesn't work for you so that's totally fine so i'm not going to argue with you about trying to convince you that you're successful we could go back and forth right so for example some gps missed things so if you caught something like maybe if they saw another gp like they would have missed it and then you'll have a counter to that and we can go back and forth about me trying to convince you that you can be significant as a gp it's not going to get anywhere fair yeah fair okay so the first thing to understand is that so a lot of this i think i think does have to do with ego but it that's not really your fault or anything but let's just understand a couple of other aspects of ego so another is in comparison so the tricky thing that the ego does is that it makes unfair comparisons so what you're sort of doing is comparing sports skill with one person video game skill with another person research accomplishments with another person and like you know some other like number one in your class with another person so what the ego does is it doesn't compare one person to one person it compares you to the best aspects of a dozen people so it's creating a situation in which you can never win yeah does that make sense it makes sense uh can i say something about that sure the problem with the ego here is it makes you think it's achievable it makes you think comparing yourself to other people it makes you feel like you can do the same thing if you work hard enough you can do this thing if you work that hard enough well are you going to be a revolutionary researcher are you ever going to win the nobel prize commie that's the problem i i don't know if i can i don't know so let's probably stability is really low really really low let's be i'm going to be a little bit critical i mean not in terms of this nuance of your language the ego doesn't tell you it's achievable right because if i ask you can you achieve it you're like probably not the problem with the ego is that it tells you that the insecurity that i feel will be fixed if you achieve i see that's the problem with the ego and then what what the problem is that it sets up these goals for you that you assume if you win the nobel prize that you'll be like content right that's what the ego tells you the problem is that even if you win the nobel prize like the ego is not going to be happy because you'll share it with someone else yeah right like yeah so so it and the key thing there is that the ego is a consequence of an insecurity so ego doesn't arise when people are confident it actually arises when people lack confidence sort of like a defense mechanism 100 right so that's why i could try to convince you that you have impact on your patients lives i'm pretty sure that your patients would agree with me by the way but your mind is going to reject that because you don't feel that way right like when you save someone's life from cancer you don't feel that way you go home after a day's work and you're like okay i saved a life today you sit down to play video games your dad walks in the room and shakes his head jokes about it and walks out yeah and so like you don't know how to appreciate your accomplishments okay okay so that's ego okay now the second thing to understand is that like you know it's okay so like what makes people happy so this is where there's been a fair amount of research in this but i think sort of the eastern traditions like we're talking sort of like the hindu tradition the yogic tradition the buddhist tradition i think they basically got the best answer to this which we're sort of verifying through science now as we sort of develop these like psychotherapy modalities that are sort of based on some of these principles that help people reduce their suffering and find contentment so i think there's like some like decent scientific evidence for this kind of stuff but that essentially being outcome oriented as opposed to action-oriented is going to like make you unhappy the interesting thing is that it won't necessarily affect your performance so this is where you know being happy is essentially about living in the moment so like and we sort of know this right because there have been periods of your life where you've been happy and those are the periods where you were kind of like focused on studying you were curious about learning you were enjoying things it sounds like you were doing okay but i don't know that being aware of what comes next would have actually made you study more and and research basically shows that like being terrified about the future versus like focusing on the present it's not like one necessarily it's not like focusing on the future actually improves your performance or gpa does that make sense so so i think if you want to be happy what you should do if you want if you enjoy research then by all means become a researcher and if you want to be happy like really try to just enjoy day to day like that that's an answer that we sort of have now the downside of that answer is how do you plan your life right if i'm just focusing on the day-to-day like how do i like plan at all and that's where like the tricky thing is planning your life for happiness is not a great idea you could plan your life for like a career but the assumption that a particular set of steps will make you happy that's where people run into trouble so i'm not suggesting that you don't plan your life but sort of saying like okay if i get an mba will it make me happy i don't think an mba or an md or a phd will in and of itself make you happy and my simple reasoning for that is that there are people who have mds who are happy and people who who have mds who are not happy the difference is that that happiness and success like aren't necessarily correlated i'm sure if you do some kind of like logistic regressional analysis you're going to find that there's some correlation but you know that's massing a bunch of variables i don't know how useful that is for an individual person does that make sense correlation is not causation yeah right so i i think this is where like you're conflating the one piece of you know recommendation i would have for you and this is sort of a situation where i feel a little bit more confident like leaning on other things as opposed to asking you a bunch of questions is because i've worked with a lot of people who are medical students and young doctors and sort of helping them through this kind of stuff and what i'd say is like you should start by teasing apart these three things that making a plan for your life and assuming that a plan for your life is going to make you happy is a mistake what do you think about that yeah yeah i agree i completely agree right and and this is where we sort of know that like if we look at your life a particular plan is not actually how you've been happy in fact the more that you conflate happiness with um planning the more unhappy you've become and the harder it's been to plan exactly so this is the kind of thing where i'd separate those two things out and by all means if you want to be a researcher because like you find research like engaging then by all means do it but this is also where anyway so okay so happiness is about living in the present by all means plan your life in sort of a strategic and forward sort of thinking measure but don't assume that a particular plan will make you happy with me yeah okay next thing so this is what tangles them up is the ego so this is where like as long as you feel unhappy and insignificant in here your mind will try to plan a life of achievement that will fix the insecurity inside does that make sense and you like an example for this one yeah so do you feel like a fantastic human being kami no how do you feel about yourself i have plenty of flaws and i look at my flaws and try to better themselves exactly myself so so there you have plenty of flaws right that's why you don't feel good about yourself yeah so what's one of your flaws one of my flaws is that i'm not a nobel prize winning researcher right so the ego this is an issue of identity right so if i identify as a nobel prize-winning researcher do you understand that that has to do with my identity it's like an ego right so like you can identify as a doctor you can identify as a man you can identify as a father you can identify as a researcher you can identify as a nobel prize winning researcher or just a regular researcher those are all aspects of identity agreed yes yeah okay so if one of my flaws and something that makes me unhappy about myself is that i'm not a nobel prize winning researcher what can i do to be happy okay i'm asking that's the question yeah i mean going on with what you said basically living in the moment no trying to react too far ahead no no no no no no no we're asking you what your mind is telling you to do what is the mind how do i correct that if if i'm flawed that's you gave me the right answer but i'm looking for the wrong one yeah just study and get your nobel prize exactly right so now we see how the ego is the root of your plan and your happiness because the ego says oh i can feel better about myself if i have a nobel prize in order to get okay so that means that the nobel prize will bring me happiness now we've attached happiness to your outside outcome then what we also do is we see your plan so that gets reverse engineered into a plan oh so then in order to be happy and win a nobel prize i have to be a researcher so let's plan the next 40 years and plan on research and grinding and grinding and grinding and grinding and then we'll get our nobel prize and then we'll be happy and then the ego will be satisfied does that make sense yes yes it does but then that's like why is that hard for you because actually you've been happy and what's really confusing for you is that the moments that you've been happy are not what your ego is telling you to do so now what you're trying to do is correct an ego problem by a particular plan which you hope will end up with happiness and that's how the three things are tied together yeah i mean that's something i internally think about myself as well like i let's say have like crises like this when i'm like sitting in my room by myself thinking about stuff but then the way i calm myself down is okay just remember you're not gonna get into an exam to win the nobel prize tomorrow right it's really far ahead you don't need to think too hard about it that's how i try to fix the problem the internal conflict i have of you know should i just keep on going or should i just stop you yeah so so so i think that internal conflict is because you've got these three different dimensions that are a part of one equation that should each be its own equation yeah does that make sense i understand i understand your point here so so that's where like i'd say very practically like you've got to start thinking so i think a lot of this comes down to ego and and what makes it hard for you to feel significant yeah right so like when you do help people and i'm assuming that your patients like you yeah like are you a good doctor i'm a good doctor yeah my patients like me right so like why doesn't that help it does help but it doesn't help in the bigger picture in my head the bigger picture i have in my head yeah so and where is that bigger picture coming from there you go right yeah i understand your point yeah yeah so so now the question really becomes like like and i think this is where it's like you know dad is a neurosurgeon i'm just a gp i mean who knows if that's really what it is but we've got to start thinking a little bit about you know why did you feel inferior to other people because you also told me that you've basically felt this way your entire life which means that it has nothing to do with your accomplishments right so the ego the the is this is the tricky thing about people who have an ego in security is so the ego tells us okay so if i feel insecure and the ego tells us accomplishment will make me feel better right that's the assumption you with me yeah and then as i accomplish do i feel better no if you did then you wouldn't be here like you would have been content like if if if an outward accomplishment fixed your ego then becoming a doctor would have been sufficient yeah so despite all of your accomplishments what does the mind always say the mind always says that's not enough look someone is doing better look someone is doing better look someone is doing better so it's not actually like logic i mean it's logical but it's like selective logic that no amount of work is going to satisfy the ego which is the nature of the ego because the insecurity was not actually born of a lack of accomplishment it was born of a feeling of a lack of accomplishment and no amount of accomplishments will fix that ego yeah so then the question becomes when did you start to feel like you were not good enough that you needed to be better the more i learned it was just the more i learned the more i realized the more i found out that yeah i can do this too i can do this it's the realization if i can do this it was so so i think all of those things were reinforcing it but i would venture that you actually like this is like some weird experience that you probably had as a kid where you're you're the son of a doctor right so this is something that i too am the son of a doctor so like i i'm making assumptions here but you know generally speaking where i grew up like there were a lot there was a lot of value placed on accomplishments so fundamentally i learned that my value as a human being and my worth as a human being is tied to my accomplishments and there's a decent chance that that's something that you grew up with too yeah and so then like then it actually goes back and starts like i mean you're gonna have to do a lot of work here comey but i would say like you know maybe even working with a therapist or coach or something like that i mean you're a doctor so you you know hopefully you understand the differences like if we're talking about something traumatic that reaches a clinical threshold then you should absolutely see a therapist yeah but working through some of this stuff and sort of setting planning and goals and things like that that's like totally fine with coaching you can actually try both but this is the kind of thing where i think you need to do some very serious internal exploration and try to figure out when you started feeling insufficient and when you started feeling that if i do this thing then i will feel sufficient i mean can i say something about this sure it's gonna be really broad really you know i'm looking at the surface of it but what makes a kid happy like thinking about it as a kid what makes a kid happy if if a kid does something good and if you tell the kid it did something good for example let's say i have a child and my child just learned how to ride a bike what would i do i would congratulate him and i would present him with a price and the price would make him happy accomplishment would make him happy and the price would make him happy he knows that as he's accomplished he's getting a prize and he's happy so if i really look internally and like go back think about it i might say okay looking at other kids being accomplished in things getting rewards for it that and like seeing them happy with it being happy with it and me just watching them from the side is what made it you know what made me think oh okay i can do this as well i can get on this why shouldn't i reach or go for the price okay yes why should i do something that will make me happy at the end point i i think that that makes a lot of sense and is actually sort of precisely the problem and i think there's more digging to be done here so let me explain it this way so that only makes a kid happy if that's what the parents reinforce and teach the child okay right so if the parents say you only get the prize for accomplishment then that's exactly what the problem is is that you're creating a system where happiness gets afflict conflated with accomplishment then the problem is when these kids grow up to be adults there's no external party that is now rewarding you for accomplishment so then you end up accomplishing without being happy does that make sense because you've learned that oh if i accomplish then i'm going to get a prize but who's giving you prizes now that's why you want a nobel prize you want someone to give you a prize because that's what you think is going to make you happy because accomplishment has been tied with someone externally giving you stuff the problem is when these kids grow up to be adults they wind up like you which is that at this point no one's awarding me stuff so even though i'm accomplishing i don't feel happy the flip side of it is like also that really what you i mean there's research on this like you could look at carol dweck's research for example on mindset she did a lot of this original research that what you really if you want to raise a happy kid what you actually want to do is reward effort not accomplishment you want to focus on actions you want to get them to not look at the top of the tree but look at the branch that they're climbing on and the more that you do that the more um happy the kid will be the more resilient to failure the kid will be okay so i i understand i answered your point here so i would even venture that you grew up and you had some situations where you did something that you were proud of and that someone around you did not validate that accomplishment in fact probably what they did is they said that you were really happy like you ran to your parents and you showed them some piece of artwork and they looked at your artwork and they said what is this that other kid did better does that resonate with you at all and where are you okay uh it resonates with me a lot but not through my family but more like through my like educational life sure right so so that more at like school and like school accomplishments yeah right so like and that's where you know some i mean that's common so and this is the key thing is like you've got to go back and like re-organize your value system and like your i mean it's a lot of work but like you've really got to think through this stuff and really really start to re realize like where did i start believing that accomplishment was tied to more than accomplishment like accomplishment is great achieving things is fantastic but when did your worth as a human being start to get tied to accomplishment because when kids really develop confidence they don't develop confidence through accomplishment the way that a kid develops confidence is that even if they fail hopefully some kind of authority figure tells them hey it's unfortunate that you didn't succeed and you're still a good kid i want you to try again okay i i understand i understand your point like perfectly do you think what do you think about it you understand it as one thing it is a lot of work yep even in my head it's a lot of work yep just something to even just figure out myself even get help if needed it's definitely a big pile of work so you got to be careful is your mind looking straight or is it looking up that's the question to ask right so in terms of stress yeah so so even now as you look at how much work it is you your mind may be doing the same thing you may be looking up and saying oh if i accomplish this thing then i will be happy if i rebuild my value system from scratch then i will be happy if i do a b c and d and i accomplish these things then i will be happy and you've got to be careful kami because if you do it that way it's not going to work you're just falling into the same trap of the mind again a vicious cycle but i understand so it's gonna it's gonna be work but like reasonably common in my professional experience i've worked with people for like six months to a year and they're like basically better like it doesn't take years just like anything else that we do in life when we really focus on it we can get a lot done in a very short time okay questions where to answer i understand your points like perfectly i i will keep that in mind even just the question just conditioning myself to think okay am i looking straight or am i looking up is a good way of coping very good um so yeah good so let me try to summarize for you okay so the first thing to understand is that if you want to move through this and resolve some of this stuff is to stop conflating your ego and your personal sense of satisfaction with planning your life and being happy and to recognize that these three things can actually be separate because right now what your mind is trying to do is solve all three problems with one strategy does that make sense yeah so working on your confidence your sense of okay why do i not feel accomplished enough in the first place to ask yourself very practical questions like when i save someone's life why doesn't that help me feel good about myself like that's bizarre right so you got to start asking those kinds of questions that's about ego you can also do other kinds of practices like meditate and things like that which will give you a sense and experience of self that is beyond accomplishment the second thing that you've really got to do is plan your life but don't plan based on assuming that if i do this 40 years later i'll be happy because if that doesn't work out and here's the problem with what we call the planning fallacy which is that we make plans at the beginning and the beginning is when we have the least amount of information ergo the worst time to make a plan is actually at the beginning right so i think you should by all means make a plan don't just like you know forget about the future entirely like if you want to do research think about it focus on your application build up your application whatever do this kind of research thing if you like this if you like this like whatever by all means plan but don't plan for the sake of like professional success and almost like have it be a compass don't really focus on the end like how do i win a nobel prize really focus a little bit more on like playing a game of chess where it's like okay what's the next best move you can't plan out how to win a chess game but at any given moment you can look at a lot of possibilities and you can try to make the next best move and if you want to like apply for a phd and start doing research then by all means apply for a phd and start doing research and be like calculating about it and stuff like that the third thing is you need to do a serious exploration on what is happiness and what makes me happy and what makes me unhappy and like be scientific about it right you want to be a researcher so when you you know if you spend a day working on your application does that make you happy when you receive an acceptance somewhere does that make you happy is to really try to understand okay like what is the actual origin of happiness and once you figure out what the formula of happiness is then you can start crafting your life towards it okay um i i have two questions can i really yes ask them fast okay first of all the uh patient part when treating a patient going back home i the problem with that one i have is working as a doctor i'm sure you can you know think about it as well but living at a house my mom is a nurse also going to the house where everyone is a health care worker working on people's health i'm not saying lives working on people's health bettering people's health is something really normalized throughout my life even going to work right now i look at my patients i care for them i understand them i i try to help them in every possible way whatever i do but at the end of the day unless i'm holding the heart with my hand and just pumping the blood myself it feels it feels like normal it feels like a normal part of my life i don't feel oh this is something different that i see this is something different than i do it's something my family has been doing is something that i am doing right now we provided health care and we are still doing it yeah so that's i want to put on that one yeah yeah that's that's a very good thought you had another one or you want me to address that one first uh yeah address that one first please yeah so i think um one of the most so this is like one of the problems that actually like kids who are kind of gifted run into or kids who grow up in situations where exceptional is normal right so like you get a weird value system where what you're doing is considered run-of-the-mill and so like that's something to just kind of think about but this is also where like even people who are not exceptional or like who don't grow up in like you know households with very high expectations they also have to do this as well that even if i'm a carpenter or a plumber or a doctor this idea that doing a particular task will make me happy or make me feel accomplished that's what we sort of learn right so if we like interpret what you're saying it what it sort of means is that being a plumber being a carpenter or being a doctor finding the value and appreciation in that is actually intrinsic and and so what i'm hearing you say actually aligns perfectly with what we're talking about which is that accomplishment does not automatically equate happiness and something about the value system that you grew up in did not teach you to appreciate what you actually do so now this is where you have a personal journey to discover whether you can actually appreciate what you do right so how does it feel to sit with a patient how does it feel to not sit with a patient you may discover that actually feels completely insignificant and that's where like if that's what your internal compass is telling you i'd spend some time kind of working on it but then maybe you need to do research i mean it doesn't feel insignificant it doesn't feel extraordinary as well sitting the patient it feels normal yeah so so and and this is kind of my experience of working with people is that most of the happiness in life doesn't come from extraordinary it comes from normal and this is where we've got research on mindfulness right where it's like when i mindfully eat a piece of cake my enjoyment and happiness and contentment over the piece of cake will increase so to the enlightened person every normal experience is extraordinary that's what it means to be enlightened and these are people who have moved away from suffering and move towards contentment so this is a it's a long path kami but i think it's important for you to walk it okay i i understand it next question you had two uh i you kind of answered my second question as well with the explanation there okay uh okay one more question one last one uh you talked about someone carol i i wanted to write the name down uh about can't walk on carol tobacco okay thank you so she wrote a book called mindset which is like for popular consumption depending on whether you have access to research papers and stuff you can just look up her bibliography but there's a there's a book and then we also touch on a lot of this stuff i mean have you seen dr k's guide i i actually haven't so i i would actually you may get i don't know if people who call in get access to it or not i'm not quite sure but um you may actually want to check that out because i think there's a lot of stuff in there that will be you know was made for people like you okay so understanding purpose understanding happiness even on we talk in the recent in the guide that's coming out we talk a lot about mindset and we have some we lean on carol dweck's work and like how to change from this perspective of accomplishing brings me happiness to focusing on the action brings me happiness okay okay okay i'll i'll definitely check into it good luck to you can i ask one professional question sure what do you think about cultural psychiatry the trans-cultural psychiatry in the gaming industry the people in gaming i don't understand the question okay it's a really long question maybe i'll just email you about it later i mean you can ask it but if it's a really long question that you're shortening to seven seven words i i i think it's gonna be hard for me to answer it yeah um okay i'll start this way uh do you know about cultural psychiatry the trans-cultural psychiatry mcgill works on it so there's uh i'm familiar that psychiatry has a cultural component exactly it's about that are you do you know anyone who works on cultural aspects of psychiatry in the gaming culture because like now they're moving towards culture the culture of gaming or different cultures combining in gaming culture of gaming um like what is gamer culture exactly and the mental health i mean so the gamer i mean that's a lot of the work that we're actually trying to do because um more and more people are doing it i'm not sure off the top of my head okay you can reach out to techteller with your question and then we can forward it to our research director and see if they know anything okay thank you good luck with that oh thank you thank you so much it's been weird looking into myself yeah it's it's it gets it's kind of weird when you first start doing it but yeah good luck to you kami i really mean it thank you thank you so much i i wish you the very best as well take care man take care okay so um and that lasted longer than expected so i think once again we're gonna have to skip meditation which we're gonna have to do better about time management but um a couple of things to just recap okay so the first thing is that sometimes we go looking for happiness and either through a combination of how we're raised or you know cultural influences we sort of assume that accomplishing a particular thing will make us happy and that belief isn't entirely wrong right there's a reason we believe it it's either through some kind of cultural influence or the way that we're raised by our family or even some of our own early experiences the problem is that once we start to tie a particular accomplishment to happiness what that sort of means for us is that we have to plan a particular kind of life to be happy we start to tell ourselves like okay i have to go to this school or i have to become a doctor i have to accomplish this or i have to win a nobel prize or i have to be promoted and we start tying our happiness to particular worldly accomplishments when you do this sometimes it can be very helpful because you're going to work really hard because you assume that something is going to make you happy but what happens oftentimes is that when you start living a life where external accomplishment is how you're chasing happiness you tend to run into one of two things either an early life crisis or a midlife crisis despite a lot of accomplishment your mind continually tells you things like oh but look that person is doing better that person is doing better that person is doing better and despite all of your accomplishments it feels like it's never enough right there's always more to do there's a higher mountain to climb there's the next mountain in the next mountain in the next mountain and then what happens is there's this like critical conflict in our mind between the part of our mind that was learned that if i accomplish particular things i'll be happy and the growing part of our mind that despite accomplishing these things i'm still not happy and when these two things butt in your head this is when you get a life crisis and what i'm seeing is especially in people who are accomplished gifted etc this life crisis is not happening as a midlife crisis it's happening as an early life crisis and the crux of this life crisis is hey i've been playing the game of life with this particular strategy because i thought it would succeed and what i'm discovering is despite succeeding it's not working and then we panic because what do we do next do we keep doing this strategy do we just assume that if i keep grinding for the next 10 years 20 years 30 years 40 years i'll succeed or do we change our strategy do we say oh my god this did not work so we have to find some way new and even if we assume that that's terrifying because does this mean that i've screwed up does this mean that since i've been playing with the wrong strategy that my life is not recoverable and that i'm doomed to unhappiness or even there's anxiety how do i find out which is the right strategy i've wasted 10 years of my life with this strategy how do i make sure that i don't waste the next 10 years how do i find the right strategy this is the crisis and so oftentimes what ends up happening is that we conflate a lot of different things our ego gets conflated with planning for the future gets conflated with happiness if a particular plan for the future leads us to happiness and we crave happiness because we feel insufficient oh i i'm not good enough what do i need to be to to what do i need to do to feel good enough i need to win a nobel prize how do i win a nobel prize let's adopt this plan and so ego drives your life plan or an insecurity or a feeling of not being enough creates a life plan with the end goal of being happiness and now we've combined all three of these things but there's actually a fair amount of research that shows us that these three things are actually very separate resolving an insecurity can sometimes be done through psychotherapy you don't have to live a particular life or win a nobel prize you can just go see a therapist and they'll help you work through your insecurities planning a particular life doesn't necessarily lead to happiness and there's even been research on this that we know that there are certain principles of happiness like living in the present it's not that winning a nobel prize will necessarily make you happy and this is what we sort of see in people who are very very accomplished as they think okay getting promoted becoming vp will make me happy still not happy senior vp will make me happy still not happy june your partner will make me happy still not happy seeing your partner will make me happy still not happy so we go on accomplishing accomplishing accomplishing and we're not happy at all so the key thing if you're kind of in this situation is to tease these three things apart and dive into each one and don't plan a life to fix an internal insecurity because that's the strategy that's wrong is assuming that this internal dissatisfaction that i have will be fixed by someone handing me a piece of paper or by getting a corner office or by driving a fancy car and it's when we tangle all these three things together which is exactly what our ego does right it says i don't feel good enough therefore accomplish more when you accomplish more you'll feel good enough how do we accomplish we have to devote our life to doing this kind of thing and so when i work with people like this this is where really teasing apart these three things is really really important and working on them kind of individually and as you do that hopefully you'll resolve your insecurity you'll start to discover the nature of happiness and be happier day to day and you will actually be more accomplished in life you
