and that's the way that you start living your life if you're paralyzed by your doubts hi uh my name is i mean my discord name is anna carenina but you can call me karen okay um i'm from mexico um i'm an illustrator okay and um and just to uh i don't know if that's enough introduction welcome karen thank you um well uh now about the question sure i about how i feel about my life well i'm actually very happy with my work life i do what i love and i'm financially stable the problem is my personal life i have a lot to learn and improve um i'm currently very independent emotionally and seriously considering to ask for a clinician to diagnose me but i'm also very dramatic when i'm feeling anxious so i don't know how much of it is my anxiety talking or reality which is uh which which is why i tend to mix up um both quite often um i'm scared of being alone in the future because of this okay my friend circle is actually small and i worry that i might might push my loved ones away if they get tired of me um i edited that last part because then i realized that it was also my anxiety worrying about the future because i know uh i mean i my first circle is is um is is form of people that i trust very much and i know i mean they've been helping me a lot and that's why i'm happy with my work life because my sister and and my friend they they really support me but i feel like i just started trying to change and being a better person just because i depend too much on them and and i just like based my opinions on on what they say and it's like um i'm always looking for someone to depend on defend what i mean sorry to to depend oh okay i see okay so so when you say you're emotionally dependent can you help me understand what you mean by that yeah i mean um for example when i buy something i'm always waiting to see um how they react to what i buy or to what i watch or or what i say to see if it's right i mean if i see that they like what i what i buy what i like um then i think it's right okay yeah and i and i never question it i see and what do you think about that well i i think that it's a problem because i mean they've been actually trying to help me with that um doing things like um just asking me to to say my opinion before them but i see that i'm always like anxious waiting like it's a it's it's it's very it's very tiring because i'm always like trying to to guess it if i don't know what they think i'm trying to guess yeah and i never i can never be relaxed i i'm always worrying about other people whatever people think and it's very frustrating i can imagine it sounds like you want to be able to be comfortable in your own skin and be able to make your own choices and be confident in something because you like it yeah exactly yeah yeah that sounds very tiring um i was about to ask you know what's the problem with uh wanting other people's approval but it sounds to i mean can you see other are there i'll just ask anyway you know what's the problem with wanting other people's approval because you think of it as a problem right it's just that it's very tiring and okay so let's try to understand a couple of things um one is i think if you're if you haven't gotten clinically evaluated that's a great first step uh and at the same time i think that sometimes we think that getting a clinical evaluation or getting therapy will fix all of our problems but what i really find therapy is useful for is helping us fix our own problems does that make sense yeah so i think it's a good idea for you to get evaluated if you're concerned about it and this is the kind of thing where i think like like you know most human beings should probably at some point just get you know evaluated almost because we sort of do this with physical health where we'll screen people or we'll have annual physicals right we just want to make sure that everything is working okay the interesting thing is that even though mental health is up you know part of our health and well-being it's not something that we like screen for or sort of check in about on a regular basis so i think that's a good idea um does that make sense yeah totally i mean um i i think the the reason why i hadn't considered it before is that i was worried that i might like get um like if if i get a bad psychologist that tries i mean i i'm worried i worry that i might try to depend on my psychologist um yeah so it's like yeah yeah so that's kind of tricky right because it's like here you are depending on your friends but if you get someone who's really really good at emotionally supporting you it's almost like more addictive and then you're gonna depend on your psychologist because they're so good at emotionally supporting you yeah exactly so in a weird way seeing a psychologist could actually make your problem worse yeah precisely yeah that you know and then then the question is and i think so i think there's a lot here to talk about garan and i'd love to try to break down a couple of things for you is that okay yeah okay so the first is i'm so glad that you shared what your concerns are about seeing a a mental health professional because that sort of makes sense right if my problem is emotional dependence and my goal is emotional independence you're like to see someone who is a professional at helping people who are emotionally dependent may make me professionally dependent that's problem number one yeah so problem number two is so you're emotionally let's say dependent on your friends and then you're kind of thinking like oh but if i like don't become independent i'm gonna burden my friends and then like what if they get tired of me and like i'm not being a good friend right does that make sense yeah yeah totally but then the question is is that your anxiety or is that legitimate right yeah it's like i don't even know like if i say this is my anxiety and it's not real then what i couldn't like but if i'm wrong i'm just gonna end up messing up all my relationships yeah but if it is my anxiety i shouldn't give in to that because that's me giving in to my anxiety and then like i'm looking to them for reassurance and then that's just causing like that's making the problem worse yeah and so that like that's the tricky thing right so even if we think about like the therapist there it's like what's anxiety and what is it because is seeing a therapist is that um you know is that a legitimate worry or is that my anxiety because i can imagine that you maybe feel a little bit stuck or paralyzed yeah completely yeah that sounds tough okay so let's try to help you with this okay thank you so the first thing to understand so we're going to talk about a couple of practical things and then we're going to talk about some more like root sort of understanding the mind so okay this so in order for you to need reassurance from other people well so let me ask you this why do people need reassurance from other people um well in my case uh thanks to to the to the guide um and your videos i and my friends of course i realized that i want um i i need reassurance because i always doubt what i'm doing i never know if what i'm doing is right or or wrong and i always want to be right i want to make sure that i don't make mistakes okay so there are two important things there the first is where did you get the idea that like where does your doubt in yourself come from well so human beings usually aren't born doubting right so if you think about a child a child will like do all kinds of stupid stuff because they don't really have the capacity for doubt does that make sense yeah do you have a sense of when you started to like have you always been this way or did you really start to become pretty anxious and doubt yourself at a particular time in your life i feel like it was when i was a a little child um i it's uh it comes from from both of my parents i i feel like in a way it was always very confusing which was what of what i did was right or wrong um the rules were always changing and whenever i did something that my mother would think it was wrong she would like if it was during a conversation for example she would like um give me like a little uh not really hurtful but little kicks just like to tell me under the table to tell me like you know you should stop and and i feel like i'm always looking for that from other people like um i i didn't even know that was something that was happening to me until recently when i told my sister that i during a conversation that i thought she was uh trying to tell me something was wrong and she was like oh no i i just i just have a tick i wasn't trying to tell you anything yeah and and that was when i realized that something was wrong and yeah i feel like since then i'm always like looking for someone to kick me under the table and tell me to stop or do something else so so i think there there are a couple of really important things i think that's a very important story and garden i applaud you for doing the kind of internal work to make that discovery so that makes my job really easy you've already figured it out so let's understand a couple of other things so you're trying to not make mistakes right so what makes something right and what makes something wrong i mean i guess there's not really something right or wrong i i know that i have a very black and white vision so um i i guess it just depends on what i think is right or wrong well so so i think that's what's really confusing is is what i'm hearing is that when you grew up you were taught that there was right and wrong the problem is that no one ever like told you what the rules were ahead of time right so imagine i have like a pet and i don't tell the pet where it's allowed to use the bathroom and then like one day it uses the bathroom and i yell at it and then so the pet feels bad and the next day it uses the bathroom somewhere else and like i don't yell at it and it can never figure out the rules of the game yep right and so what i'm hearing from you is that you don't know ahead of time what the rules of the game are and so the only thing in the same way that your mom used to give you kicks under the table to tell you when you screwed up you're still looking for external people to tell you what the rules of the game are because you don't know what they are like yeah totally right and then when i ask you about it like what are the rules of the game you're like well there aren't really rules for the game and you're correct and that's why it's so damn confusing yeah like if you buy a shirt and you're like i don't know if this is a good shirt or a bad shirt and you're waiting for your friend to say oh that's a great shirt because like there's no you know is it a good shirt or a bad shirt like i don't know you don't know like i don't think you can like it's a shirt yeah and so i think the reason it's so hard for you is because you're playing a game that can't be won right you're looking for an objective right answer in a world that doesn't have objective right answers and why are you doing that it's it's actually because you were conditioned to do that like you literally you tried to figure things out and you're sitting there and you're just talking and then your mom is like kicking you under the table and so your brain learned at some point that like okay the one thing and so then imagine what hap what did you start doing with your mom when she started kicking you under the table you had no clue why what do you end up doing what's the one strategy that you can do that won't get you kicked stop or sometimes i was just like um i'm gonna be a rebel and do what i want but i just end up doing the opposite good but still feeling bad you know yeah because you want to do something right so so that's really important so the winning strategy is to do nothing because if you don't say anything and you're paralyzed and you don't act right which is what an anxious person does we're never going to take a chance because if you never take a chance you're never in danger but then what is that rebel that rebel is the part of you that wants something right there is actually a part of you that knows what you like knows what you care about and then what happened to that part well i think that part just it's like when i get tired of just doing what other people ask me to do or well what i think they asked me to do because they really don't ask me anything i just assume what they want or what they think it's right so when i get to like a boiling point i just do whatever just the opposite thing or just uh something like uh impulsive sometimes it's just like oh if in this moment i want to um buy this super expensive thing i'm gonna buy it it doesn't matter what other people think it doesn't matter if i have that about buying it it doesn't nothing matters i'm just gonna do it and screw everything yeah right yeah yeah so carl let me ask you something how do you keep something from boiling over well i guess i just have to um turn off the heat or just like open the valve yeah right so like if i'm if i'm cooking something let's say i'm making rice and it's about to boil over what do i do well you um i don't know how to say that like you uh just take the lid off yeah perfect right so the only way that your rebel the only way that your desires can break through is to break through you don't let them out in a small way at all so the only way that you're gonna your desires actually come out is when you get so frustrated with feeling stuck and needing people's approval that you're like screw it and then all of your desires come out in probably a slightly unhealthy way yeah and so i think the the thing here and i think chat has sort of figured this out already but i think this is the kind of thing where like first and foremost i think you've got to let your rebel out a little bit because you actually do know what you want right so i don't really know i really know sometimes oh yeah you know you just doubt yourself oh well yeah yeah that's right right so so yeah yeah so so this is something to understand what you want your mind knows the question the doubt is separate okay yeah right like i want a slice of pizza should i eat a slice of pizza the desire is still clear though does that make sense i want to slide a piece a slice of pizza well let's try it yeah is it is it a good idea or a bad idea is it right or wrong to eat the slice of pizza that's where your doubt really comes in because once again you're looking for an objective right or wrong and it's like you can cut like you know is it could you eat healthier things than pizza sure but you're also like cara garland you're doing pretty good you're you've got a job that you like you're working on yourself it sounds like you're working really hard sounds like you're spending a lot of time studying yourself and learning about yourself and i'm kind of feeling like you deserve a slice of pizza or you deserve a nice purse from time to time what do you think i i feel like i should say yes what i feel like what if i if i'm just doing it um i think i'm starting to worry again about ah good so keep going keep going yeah i i i was judging what i what i wanted if i deserved it or not oh good so so you're on the right track right so here's what i want you to do so first of all huge props for noticing that but what if right so can you finish the thought for us like what were you thinking when i was younger you deserve it you're a good person you deserve to be happy in life and what does your mind say saying you're not good enough yet to get that slice of pizza right so let okay you're gonna get it when you when you know when you're good yeah so so and and what do you have to do to be good enough how do we satisfy that part of your mind it's never gonna be satisfied you should be teaching [Laughter] it's so frustrating because because i feel like i've been told this by my friends before and and i always let my mind away and i always let the dog just get the better of me and what do you think about that well i think that probably is because i never pay attention to to what i'm doing i just let it win i don't i don't fight it i i would oh i think you fight it a lot but but i think this is the kind of thing where got on you you've gotta so you've got to be careful there because that thought right so i've heard this a thousand times why am i so idiotic that i i never learn what are you doing there you're kicking yourself under the table yeah that's right okay so like i think this is where now the next thing that that you can sprinkle in here is gonna be a little bit of compassion like it's okay to lose to your mind a lot right like it's a journey you've come a long way you have a long way to go and your doubts are there for a reason this is something very important to understand your doubts are actually there to protect you right because what does the doubt say does the doubt say oh you're dumb you're stupid no the doubt says if you do this you'll wind up being hurt you see that if i if i'm too emotionally dependent on my friends i'm gonna drive them away and then i'll be alone so your doubt is actually trying to protect you it's trying to look out for you it's it's like so it's not your enemy actually right so this is where i want you to change a little bit about the way that you talk to yourself and sort of notice that you know it's like a guard dog that's trying to protect you and also not everyone who visits you is an enemy that the guard dog needs to be barking about you don't feel like that right so yeah and that's where like you know like if you want to calm down a guard dog if you want to teach a guard dog to trust you don't do it by kicking the dog every time it barks that's going to amp up with stress so you pet the dog and you're like hey it's okay it's okay i'm worried about eating a slice of pizza it's okay that like i'm worried that this is gonna be the beginning of the end and like you know there's a part of me that really wants this so what i'm gonna do i'm gonna eat a slice of pizza and i'm gonna tell the guard dog to watch while i eat this slice of pizza and i'm gonna ask the guard dog at the end was it okay that i ate the slice of pizza i want you to talk to yourself in that way does that make sense yeah because it's operating on old information so what you have to do is give it a new experience so get that slice of pizza sit down eat it the guard dog is gonna start barking be like hey just let me finish the slice of pizza then you let me know if this is a mistake or not that sounds great you've really come a long way i'm i'm honestly very impressed karen thank you i mean i didn't do this by myself um thank you so much um to you and healthy gamer and everyone comes on stream i feel like i i learn a lot from all of you and i'm very lucky to have my sister and my friend which always support me and ask me i mean such good questions um of course i feel like now i'm ignoring what i did what but yeah i thank you so let me ask you one last question karen did you help someone else today by coming on i i think i they i mean how does that feel it it feels great um i i hope that if anyone is listening um you're not alone thank you so much for coming on you're making me tear up thank you so much for having me i really appreciate it take care seriously i appreciate you like i'm so glad cause like i think you did a great job of sharing with other people like i mean i think a lot of people have the kinds of thoughts and struggles you do which is what we're all about so thank you very much for coming and good luck and enjoy yourself thank you take care okay so let's just summarize real quick okay so anxiety is like is super tricky so the problem with anxiety is sometimes we've got like social anxiety right and we're like okay if i'm emotionally dependent on my friends like i need my friends for emotional support and like that's okay like that's what friends are kind of there for but then it's like if you become too dependent on them you're gonna drive them away and then the problem is like well wait a second hold on is that my anxiety telling me that i'm gonna drive them away so that's not like actually false and i'm not gonna drive them away but what if that is so if it's my anxiety i'm gonna ignore it and i'm gonna continue being emotionally dependent but that could sabotage your relationship and so then you have to like stop for a second and try to figure out okay wait is that my anxiety so like should i become more emotionally independent or is this my anxiety or what and even in terms of like and so it's kind of tricky right because you don't know like is giving in to your anxiety being emotionally dependent or is giving in to your anxiety not being emotionally independent it's like i i don't know am i supposed to be like conquer my anxiety and be a better friend or am am i suppose it's just impossible to figure out and so that's where they're like a couple things to keep in mind the first is understand that your doubt essentially requiring reassurance from other people comes from a doubt in yourself right so when you don't have faith in your own conclusions your mind naturally goes to someone else that's the only way it works the tricky thing is if you're plagued with this cycle of doubt in yourself chances are that cycle of doubt was instilled in you and what we heard today was that there's essentially like a set of experiences where like our brain doesn't know what the rules are anytime a child grows up in a situation where the rules keep changing they can't figure out what's right and wrong and if you can't figure out what's right and wrong you can't act with confidence because are you doing the right thing are you doing the wrong thing if you know you're doing the right thing then you can act with confidence and so we sort of carry this thing with us and it's trying to protect us and what it does is it keeps us from acting it paralyzes us why does it paralyze us because if we do something what if it's a mistake best thing to do is nothing because inaction is safety and then we start to feel very paralyzed and stuck in our life so if you want to get through this god illustrated this beautifully you know first thing is you've got to understand where did your doubt in yourself where was that born and recognize that that doubt becomes actually like a guard dog that's trying to protect you at the same time just because a dog grew up in a really dangerous neighborhood and barks at everything that goes by the dog learned the right lessons for that situation but as we grow up as we change neighborhoods as our life evolves and grows the rules of the past don't necessarily translate to the present and so then what we've got to do is be very careful on a moment-to-moment basis of paying attention to that dog and learning how to kind of calm it down right it's not beating it up because eventually what happens is sometimes we even cage the dog and we keep it far far away and then we sort of have this explosion and we act very rashly because we're so tired we're so fed up of being inactive and being unable to move we get so frustrated with ourselves for feeling stuck that we get this burst of like uncontrolled motivation and we make really rash decisions that cause us problems and when they cause problems by the way what does the dog say the dog says i told you so you shouldn't have acted at all i tried to keep you from making this mistake the solution is don't act don't act don't act i told you so i told you so i told you so and then it tells you again and again and again you stay stuck you stay stuck you stay stuck it builds up builds up builds up explosion and the cycle repeats itself so notice that doubt and the key thing here is that if you get an overflow of like emotion that leads to some kind of rash action the key thing there is you've got to vent that out a little bit at a time you've got to figure out okay like you actually know what you want you just doubt that it's the right thing and so the way to move forward is to acknowledge that there's a doubt and to move take a tiny step forward what can your doubt tolerate what can the guard dog handle you know it can handle a little bit it's like watching very closely but we could start with something simple like okay i'm going to eat the slice of pizza let's see how i feel about myself ask the guard dog talk to yourself because it's actually looking out for you it's not your enemy it's a survival mechanism and as you start to take these little steps as you look at the root of where you started to doubt yourself as you start to look at the way that your mind works hopefully you can start to take steps forward you can start to rehabilitate the dog rehabilitate that part of your mind that's terrified that you're going to make a mistake because at the end of the day whether you have a slice of pizza today or not like unless you're like lactose intolerant or you know gluten intolerant or something like that you can have a slice of pizza like it's not going to be the end of the world and that's the way that you start living your life if you're paralyzed by your doubts you
