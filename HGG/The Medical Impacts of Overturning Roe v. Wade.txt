for those of you that don't know there was a landmark supreme court case in the united states so this is going to be basically u.s focus for our international audience and um you know thankfully doesn't really apply to you hopefully it doesn't apply to you but uh where the supreme court of the united states basically upheld um the right to get an abortion and so based on this case it was like basically a federally protected ability to get an abortion so today the u.s supreme court in a 6-3 decision overturned that case and basically said the states get to decide so there's not a federal protection against abortion it's a state-specific issue where states get to decide whether you can have an abortion or not as a consequence of this there are many states that based on their political leanings will basically outlaw abortion so i'm not a political expert by any means i don't i have some political opinions but it's not like my political opinions are more valid or than anyone else's but i just want to share with you all like a couple of stories and what i understand about abortion as a medical uh provider so when i was on my obstetrics and gynecology rotation in medical school i had a patient who had a fetus that had something called anencephaly so anencephaly is an exceedingly rare condition it happens to about one to three pregnancies out of about ten thousand right so we're talking like you know somewhere around one out of ten thousand two out of ten thousand one out of three thousand depends a little bit on ethnicity and there are other kinds of different variables but anencephaly is a fetus that does not have basically a brain so it's possible in the development of a fetus for you something goes wrong and they're born without the cranium or not born they're developing without a cranium and without a brain so naturally what happened in this case is that generally speaking it's a reasonable thing for someone to have an abortion and terminate the pregnancy when you have a fetus that is completely unviable so fetus has a heartbeat it just has no brain and its capacity to live is like basically non-existent so a lot of times these um you know the fetuses can be alive at the time of birth but many times they're not and then they all inevitably i can't think of i've never heard maybe there is a single i can't think of a single case well this will turn into a viable human being so the first thing that i want to say is as a medical doctor like there are absolutely reasons to get abortions from medical reasons it's like the there's no way like despite the fact that it has a heartbeat there's no way that this will ever be like a human being it just it's missing a brain right so like you can have and essentially what happens is they go into cardiac arrest because the part of your brain that governs your heartbeat there's a part of your brain that governs and keeps you breathing and governs your heartbeat which is non-functional because it's missing or it's like severely underdeveloped in people with encephaly and so like in my mind there's no doubt that abortions are medically necessary at some points okay that's the first thing the second thing is that generally speaking there's also a lot of public health and epidemiologic data that restricting access to abortion does not it may reduce abortions to some amount but what it really does is reduces access to safe abortions and that women who aren't able to care for a child or aren't able to stay pregnant will seek abortions in other ways so there are all kinds of kind of like homebrew kind of abortion techniques and things like that you know people use the phrase coat hanger but there's good evidence that shows that when you restrict access to safe abortions what happens is people are gonna like get abortions in unsafe ways there's also all kinds of evidence that shows that restrictions on safe abortions disproportionately affect poor people so what this means is that if you're rich and you live in a place where abortions aren't legal what you'll probably do is just fly to a place where they are illegal get a procedure in secret and fly back what happens though is if you're if you lack means like this is this is a law that disproportionately affects poor people who don't have the means to handle the abortion and there's a lot of evidence not i mean that's an overstatement i've heard stories about you know cases of this where people who are very anti-abortion who have gotten abortions themselves and in their case it was okay right but like all the other abortions all the abortions except for mine are morally reprehensible i think we just sort of know and there's all kinds of other negative impacts like so we see negative economic impacts we see crime rates increase about a decade or 15 after 15 years after abortion becomes unavailable so we'll also see similarly crime rates decrease 15 years after you make abortion sort of accessible so i i think from a medical standpoint you know there are tons of reasons like ectopic pregnancies and stuff like that where abortions are like medically i wouldn't quite say necessary but medically um i mean there are cases where they're medically necessary but i'm not an obstetrician they're definitely medically like reasonable cases for abortion and so i think these kinds of blanket protections are important to preserve those kinds of things because i don't i don't know that lawmaker so first of all like a lot of the people who are passing laws don't really consider medical evidence when they pass laws right so they'll sort of say like viable heartbeat for example is something that i hear a lot is sort of a dividing line but like what about the case of anencephaly and so this is the kind of thing where like i think it's a real unfortunate thing that the supreme court has done i think it's like going to disproportionately affect people who are poor i think it's not going to be good for our society i think it's not going to be good for potentially fetuses or uh prospective mothers and and it's really unfortunate like i i mean if y'all want to talk more about it i suppose we can but i i don't really have much more to i mean in a sense i have a lot to say but in a sense like it's pretty open and shut at least in the medical community about the the importance of abortions like i don't think that there's a whole lot of debate amongst actual doctors about the importance of this um so like you know but like doctors are not necessarily lawmakers and like that's i think okay in a sense i just wish that lawmakers would really consider medical science a little bit more when they instituted policies like this so here's like basically what i kind of think about it it's like okay if you wanna outlaw abortion at the minute like this is my basic problem in terms of like policy is that people don't play the tape through to the end so it's like what happens to that child when it's born so if you've got like a 16 year old who's like has a kid like what happens to the child what happens to the mother like do you have maternity leave do you have child care services like what what happens and i think we sort of learned this in medicine where so we decided at some point as medical doctors which is a good decision that we're not going to let someone die so when you come into the emergency room with a heart attack or whatever we don't care what you did prior to coming into our doors we're gonna do our best to save your life so this is like really important it became also pretty important during covid when when people you know were like anti-vaccine didn't get vaccinated and like as a doctor like do you let that person die because it's their decision no you don't so we have we have a simple rule in medicine which is that we're going to try to help people no matter what i think it's a great rule the problem is that rule creates some interesting issues so the first is that if we're going to provide emergency services and when someone comes in we don't ask you like can you afford you know cardiac icu time we're going to save we're going to save the person's life the problem is that when we do that it's very expensive so as it's very expensive like someone has to eat that cost it's generally speaking eaten by the taxpayer this is also something that people in the u.s don't really understand is that without socialized medicine we have socialized medicine already the difference is we just have a very very very expensive form of it so let me walk y'all through like what happens and i guess this is a tangent that we're going on so if a homeless person comes in with severe heart disease and a heart attack we put that person in the cardiac icu we provide care for them right because we're not going to let people die that's not that's the line that we've drawn in the sand we're going to provide people with care then let's say that the icu costs a hundred thousand dollars in terms of the stay so the patient can't pay because they're homeless and they have no money so then who eats the cost the hospital eats the cost if the hospital keeps on eating costs if they keep on providing a hundred thousand dollars worth of care and never get reimbursed in it what happens the hospital goes under right because you can't keep on giving free care without getting like paying you know for your ventilators and nurses and doctors and all cleaning people and all this kind of stuff so then what the hospital does is goes to the government and says hey by the way we're gonna go out of business because there's a bunch of uninsured people that are getting life-saving medical care the government says okay what do you need from us to not go out of business because we as the government need you to exist right because otherwise our populists can't get medical care and the hospital says we need this amount of money to stay afloat because of the care we're providing the energy and the government says okay fine and then they pay that money and where does that money come from it comes from taxpayers right that's where the government gets its money so we're already subsidizing this care now the problem the real problem is that if we had started that person on medication for forty dollars a month like if we had started this person on a statin we'd started them on our blood pressure medication if we had provided this person with a thousand dollars of medical care over the last five years it would have saved us 99 000 in icu care but we don't pay for that because this person can't afford it so this is one of the reasons why the united states has one of the best health care systems in the in the world in terms of like the quality of particular procedures and outcomes that we can deliver and it is so bloated and expensive so the value of the united states healthcare system is low like so that what you get for what you spend is actually inefficient but what you get is excellent in terms of like the quality of care that we provide if that makes sense and so this is my basic issue with a lot of like uh healthcare policy is that i think you you've got to like if you're thinking about you know socialized healthcare and stuff it's not about like we're already doing it we just people i don't the people don't seem to understand this like people don't get it that it would just be cheaper to like in astronomically cheaper to provide this person with medical care longitudinally for free like we would save money we would save like 99 grand in this scenario right and so it's like it's just such an inefficient system and so this is the thing about medical policy is that like i think you got to play the tape through to the end so like even if you want to make an argument for being pro-life and like not letting people get abortions like what happens next right that's what i that's what i think is really unfortunate about like all these policies like you know you got to play the tape through to the end and account for all of the consequences for your law and that doesn't happen and so then what we sort of end up with is situations that are just like objectively worse like we could do objectively better we could save a life provide a greater quality of life reduce morbidity and reduce mortality and save money doing it uh so wonder chimp is asking the preventive care price isn't wrong but don't hospitals only recruit seventy percent of the cost of a medicare medicaid stay the rest is covered by inflating costs to private insurance yeah in essence yes so a lot of times hospitals will lose money on certain payers and make money on other pairs but there are other advantages of medicare and medicaid so for example like medicare will pay they'll pay on time private insurance will like fight you for like three or six months and then they'll pay you more so there's there's all kinds of i mean it gets super complicated which is part of the reason the health care system is so messed up basic problem with the healthcare system in the united states in my opinion is that the person who spends the dollar has no recourse if their dollar is misspent right so like when i purchase a candy bar if i don't like the candy bar i have the option to not purchase it again so what this does is guarantees some amount of feedback between me and the candy bar producer or if they make their candy bar too small or they make it taste too crappy i'm gonna stop buying it basic issue is that that this feedback mechanism is not in place right so when i have employer-based health insurance like if i'm unhappy with my health insurance i can't quit right like i can't do that so when you when you have a fundamental like when there's a when i pay a dollar to you and you pay a dollar to someone else and that person provides me with health care that triangle sort of situation is like not conducive to because they're altered incentives so it's that's a basic issue you
