so you're here and just like you have matter and energy that cannot be destroyed you also have karmas that cannot be destroyed and that every action you take has consequences into the future so i almost think about a human life is a thousand different karma karmas spreading out into the world and affecting people right left center all over the place for a year 10 years 50 years it's almost like what we think of as the butterfly effect right so every time you act you are creating a cause that is an effect in someone else's life how do you balance the learn to let go and then never let go slash keep the person in your memories during grief this is a great question so when we talk about grief we tell people to learn to let go but we also like say you should keep the person with you right so it's kind of confusing because we don't really explain this stuff we just have like okay learn to let go but like keep the person do i keep the person in my memories do i keep thinking about them or do i let them go like does letting them go mean that i don't think about them anymore like how does this work i think one of the most under taught things in our society is how to grieve my god if we just taught everyone how to grieve the world would be such a better place so let's understand this and like we're going to dig into a little bit of science here okay off the cuff so if you look at trauma there's really interesting research on trauma and one of the key discoveries about trauma is that when you have a negat when the human mind experiences a negative event it tends to ruminate on that event so we tend to think about it so our my mind goes to the past and i think about it over and over and over again then what happens is we enter a fork in the road and the mind will either do one of two things so for the mind that heals after the trauma it'll do one thing the mind that fails to heal from the trauma will do something else so the mind that fails to heal from trauma will continue to ruminate in the past all it'll do is like think about that thing in the past the mind that heals takes something from that and integrates it into the self so like what we see from for for trauma survivors is that survivors who take that negative thing and then like use that information to shape themselves in the world view going forward are the ones who do well okay so like a really good example of this is if you look at like cancer survivors right we even have a term for cancer survivor we don't have like you know this term for like rheumatoid arthritis survivors or um you know like e coli survivors or cholera survivors or things like that we don't have like an ethoscene identity around all kinds of diseases right i'm a car accident survivor i'm an alcohol use survivor like we don't say things like that right so if you look at something like trauma survivor or cancer survivor what does that mean that means that these this is something that people have done for so long that it's kind of become like a thing that people do where they take a particular negative experience and they incorporate it into themselves like looking forward into the future and when you do this successfully this is what allows you to grieve healthily right so i lost my dad many years ago but there are parts of him and parts of his wisdom and stuff like that that i've internalized and i've taken with me and like i still think about him from time to time but a lot of that grief process goes into my wiring and as it goes into my wiring and informs my future actions i've like processed that grief and like he's like i take him with me right so i haven't let him go completely but i don't actively think about him all the time so we know this from trauma that essentially when you take an experience and you let it sort of like become a part of you and you you you change your sort of internal like view of yourself and your view of the world and a good example of this is a cancer survivor because that becomes a part of my identity right i'm a cancer survivor now i survive cancer i can manage this right i've lived through cancer like i can handle this so if you think about that sense of resilience that you get it comes from taking that negative event and incorporating it into yourself and then when you look to the future it sort of stays with you whereas people so when we talk about like you know keeping a part of them with us that's literally what we mean what we mean is to take their those memories and experiences and and like you know time with that person and let it shape who we are now so that we can move forward in the future now when people get stuck in grief is they're not doing any internal work here they're just thinking about the person in the past right you just think about the person over and over and over again you're ruminating in the past it's not affecting you at all you're not changing who you are as a person it's not informing the way that you look to the future it's not giving you any sort of sense of like how you can live in the future all all you're doing is your mind is stuck in that rumination in the past so it's not a balance between forgetting them and keeping them in mind it's actually an integration of those experiences into who you are and then you carry it with you that's what people mean like this person lives on within us right like that's kind of a weird thing to say but like what does that actually mean there's actually science on this people have done studies and what you they've realized is when you have ruminative thoughts and you direct them towards identity formation and identity change within the self that's what happens that's how someone lives on within you those are the steps and when people get stuck thinking about the person instead of about themselves and how that person affected them that's when they get stuck in grief and don't move on right i can't move on i had a i fell in love once at the age of 19 and she was perfect and it was amazing and now 28 years later all i can think about is that person that's me being stuck in the past i'm just ruminating on that person has nothing to do with me so what we know from trauma survivors is that people who healthily incorporate trauma into their life are the ones that do better and in terms of grief it's the same thing it's incorporating that person into your life and there's another interesting perspective on this i shouldn't say another i'd say it's corollary but from a completely different tradition so if you look at buddhism so buddhism and the buddhist belief of karma is a little bit different from the hindu belief of karma so the hindu belief of karma is that i've got a soul and i rack up all these karmic debts and i people owe me karmic debts and my soul moves from one body to the next and i carry all my debts with me right so when a lot of people say oh like you can't carry it into the next life the hindus kind of disagree okay there are different perspectives i'm kind of simplifying so caveat there the buddhist perspective on karma is slightly different so they do believe that things from the past from past lives will affect you there are things from the past that will affect you but you don't carry your soul forward that you don't carry your debts so the way that would this kind of think about it is that you exist in this world and this once again is a simplification i'm sure that the scholars out there may disagree with this so you're here and just like you have matter and energy that cannot be destroyed you also have karmas that cannot be destroyed and that every action you take has consequences into the future so i almost think about a human life is a thousand different karma karmas spreading out into the world and affecting people right left center all over the place for a year 10 years 50 years it's almost like what we think of as the butterfly effect right so every time you act you are creating a cause that is an effect in someone else's life and that sort of makes sense like if someone's you know sitting down and they they trip and they fall and they drop all their groceries and you stop for a second and you help them put their stuff together you've created like an impact in their life there's a cause and there's an effect you've like soda karmic seed which has some kind of effect versus if i feel bad about myself i make a smurf account and i poop on noobs all day in my game of choice i'm also creating a karma right i'm affecting the lives of other people and so one way to think about grief is that that person is gone that person will never be there ever again but it's actually kind of like scientifically very easy to say that their effects linger on their matter still exists their energy still exists and even their actions like literally exist right if someone leaves you brief it's kind of acknowledging that that person is gone but all these thousand actions that they've taken still live within me like their impact still will live within me the good and the bad and so then the process of grieving is integrating that once again it's acknowledging okay this person is gone but they sowed all these karmic seeds which still bear fruit and kind of acknowledging that and that like these are karmas that are left maybe they left me money maybe they didn't leave me money and that leaves me resentful they said certain things to inspire me they said certain things to hurt my feelings they said certain things to emotionally scar me right they were not a very good parent and they struggled with addictions themselves and so i'm gonna have to like let go that there's ever gonna be like a parent in my life who was like you know perfect and universally supportive or even decent and as you work through that as you sort of recognize that they're gone but their karmic seeds remain in this world you can sort of work through that integrate whatever you want to heal whatever you want to and kind of like move forward but that's also consistent with this sort of idea that integration of trauma and morning into the self is how people heal and we sort of have science behind that does that make sense so in short so in short you know how do you balance forgetting and never letting or letting go and never forgetting someone by integrating them into yourselves and when your mind is stuck and ruminating in the past that's when you when you're stuck in grief when you take what that person did in their life and make it a part of you and change you because of them then you integrate it into yourself and then you can move forward and then you've like grieved in a healthy way zx ping zp ping thank you so much for this you're very welcome a lot of first time chatters today so krusty os asking so dr k why would you want to create karmas that's a great question so the answer is you don't so this also is a little bit more from the hindu tradition or leans more towards the hindu tradition but the buddhist may also agree it's you know and the traditions are not monolithic right so hinduism just like christianity and buddhism just like christianity or islam has like all these different sects with like slightly different beliefs okay so i'm oversimplifying here but the short answer is that the whole point of meditation and this is by the way is like not really disputed okay this is just forgotten but everyone who's talking about mindfulness and the benefits of meditation for anxiety of which we're part of it right because it does help with anxiety but my meditation was never designed to help mindfulness that's not why people did it that's not why buddha taught it so anyone who's like oh yeah you know like i like buddhism and stuff don't ever forget that the reason for meditation is enlightenment and what enlightenment is moksha or liberation is the freedom from the cycle of karma so the goal of all that stuff is to no longer create karmas because the problem is that any time you create a proton you create you know anytime you have a neutron and you split it into a proton you have to create an electron there's like no way around it so the problem with karma is that it's a cycle which people get stuck in and everything that they do to where they try to like fix something they like create an additional karma so there's even a story about buddha who knows if it's true or not where after he became enlightened some guy came and he's like hey i heard you're enlightened and with this like whatevs it's the guy's like i'd love to learn from you and buddha's like okay sure so it teaches this guy for a long time for years and years after many years the guy's still not enlightened and he goes to put then he's like i've been studying with you for five years and i'm still not enlightened then he spits in with his face he's like scam artist and then of course like all of buddha's disciples get enraged and they're like how dare you to the master how dare you and so they're like you know they're about to you know beat his ass i suppose and then buddha restrains him and he's like relax chill the guy's like i'm done with you and buddha's like all right adios and then the disciples are like why why did you let that dude disrespect you bro why you gotta let him disrespect you like that and buddha was like that's a karma that he owed me and so now like the reason i'm on this earth is like i've got a bunch of accounts to close out and like that one was just closed out so we're kind of done with that is that something that he owed me whatever so let him let him complete that guarmo we're not going to react to it we're just going to let him go on his way and i'm done i'm cleaning closing up shop right closing all my accounts one by one so you actually don't want to create new karmas and theoretically in in the pursuit of moocs now personally i don't believe that for myself and most humans i think when you all get to that point you can sort of you know close out your accounts but generally speaking i think that what we should do is create karmas we should create positive karmas that's like something that we should all work very hard to do so whether that's planting a tree whether that's helping out a friend whether that's helping someone pick up groceries that have fallen on the floor whether that's not smurfing and playing in the bracket that you deserve to play in right you you do what you can in this world because you're only going to be here for a limited amount of time so like what is the state of the world when you leave it so my matter will remain my energy will remain and my karmas will remain so what kind of karmas do i want to give to the world like i have if i'm just annihilated even after this life and there's no segment of all oak or dr k that that exists after this then how do i want to spend this life i want to try to create as much positivity as i can right i can create negativity but that's not what i want to do so even many many years ago i had the choice to basically become a monk or not and i chose to live in the world and i chose okay like we're going to dive into this cycle of garmad that's a choice that i make and so either we're going to go the non-karmic route or we're going to go the karmic route and i decided to go the karmic route i think that's a good choice to make but generally speaking it's not really the end game you can think about karma as like side quests right it's like you can get caught up in side quests until the end of time and this is thankfully the world is a place that continually generates new side quests and at some point we get kind of tired of doing side quests and then you do the main quest and the game is over then you become you attain moksha you attain liberation and you're kind of done does that make sense so some people are saying is this all in dr k's guide not really um so dr k's guide has a lot of foundational stuff so the thing about dr k's guide is that it's like comprehensive so the problem with doing this kind of stuff on stream is that people may have a thousand questions which we can't necessarily go into because we've got other things so the information is kind of scattered all over the place whereas dr k's guide is like much more comprehensive so if you listen to this for example and you're like oh that's really cool i want to understand karma better and i also want to understand like what's the relationship between meditation and karma how do i integrate those two things though that kind of comprehensiveness you'll find in dr k's guide right so we'll teach about karma and we'll teach about meditation and we'll teach about developing a practice so it's like it's more complete and it's like more linear it's not just dr k randomly thinking about stuff first time chatters junior fujiwara is saying dr k should i have pizza for lunch this is really important for me psychologically and spiritually i'd say it depends but generally speaking unless you are absolutely going to enjoy it and have no regrets then i would say you should not have pizza for lunch so if you are having pizza to enjoy everything that life has to offer then have the pizza but if you are someone who regrets particular choices that you make in life then don't have the pizza because if you don't have the pizza you'll take the first step towards having you you'll build up the ability to choose things that you don't want and the ability to choose and embrace things that you don't want is the most important step to become successful is mastery of the self you
