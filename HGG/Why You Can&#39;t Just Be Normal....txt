you can't like go back to the playground as an adult and try to make friends with seven-year-olds you can't start like going to places where young people are that you're way older than them and start to learn those basic skills there are many people that will tell you this is secret to happiness that is sacred to happiness but if you want to know how to live the life you must understand how your mind works only so check out Dr K guide link is in description huh I missed out on normalcy and it sucks I've missed out on every normal thing a person learns or goes through and it sucks I've missed out on socializing during my teenage years due to being homeschooled which left me socially inept when I moved on to college I don't have any cool or funny stories from then and based on the way things are now I don't think there will be any cool or funny story to tell when I'm old hell I learned how to ride a bicycle just this year there's only bad experiences for me to share like getting cheated on having to let go of a girl I loved and even though I went through all this I'm still a virgin I look around and I have no clue how people are the way they are in that they can actually be happy and have fun despite the things they go through I mean everyone around me are in relationships and it's getting some of them are getting set to get married and it feels like I'm just being left behind like I missed a really important train they all have some fun story or experience to share while I really don't there's really no point in me being I don't bring anything to the table and my friends are all busy doing their thing I still have no clue what I want to do and it all feels very pointless to me right now I seriously feel very hopeless and lonely even existing is depressing I miss the train to normalcy and it sucks and I feel like a friggin loser thanks for reading me venting so you know my heart goes out to this person I think I was this person at one point in my life I think um many of us have kind of struggled to be this person and the hardest thing is that we sort of know that in life we've got there's like a normal way to live it right you sort of board this train and if you board the train early enough it sort of sets you up for the next step so if I had friends in high school in let's say when I was growing up now I know how to form relationships if I know how to form relationships I can go into High School I've got some social skills and now that I'm in high school and if I've got social skills and I make friends then we'll I'll start interacting with people of the opposite sex or people that I'm attracted to and then I'll sort of like learn how to socialize with them a little bit and maybe if I don't even have a girlfriend or that doesn't really work out very well I get some experience or a boyfriend and then now when I go into University or college or I move on Beyond High School like I've leveled up enough right to where I can do the next phase and if I do well enough in college then I've kind of set myself up to succeed in my job and even if each level is a little bit of a struggle boarding the train to normalcy means that I've got a fighting shot at the next level sure High School is a little bit different occult college is even a little bit more difficult maybe entering the professional world is a little bit difficult but I've been leveling up the way that I'm supposed to and sometimes what happens is we miss the train and once we miss the train then Things become really really challenging because like even if you try to go back and make up for it the world doesn't sort of see you the world doesn't kind of like forgive that right you can't like go back to the playground as an adult and try to make friends with seven-year-olds you can't start like going to places where young people are that you're away older than them and start to learn those basic skills right it's not like life is sort of made for you to catch up and even if you try to catch up what actually ends up happening is I I'm sure you can imagine this if I'm a 20 year old and I go hang out at a playground with eight-year-olds everyone's gonna think I'm a creep and it's that's not the only situation in which we're considered creeps right so if I am awkward and socially anxious and I try to go talk to someone they're gonna think I'm a creep and so this can be almost a paralyzing situation in fact if you really pay attention to what this person is kind of thinking and maybe you're thinking this too I've missed the boat and once you've missed the boat there's no boarding it right like that's the whole idea behind a boat that's why we use that analogy because everyone who's ready to gets on board and then The Boat Leaves and you're you're left behind you can't catch up if you jump into the water and you start swimming you're never gonna catch up that's the whole idea right because this is the way that life is is we do one thing and then we do the next thing and then we do the next thing and this is growth and this is development and this is healthy but what if we missed it we start to feel a little bit hopeless and if we really want to understand how to do this we have to realize that there's actually something really really really important that is a critical skill that we need to learn it's probably the most underappreciated skill out there and because we don't even sort of think about it as a positive in fact if you were to learn this skill most people would think that this is absolutely idiotic to be able to learn how to do this but it's the one crew crucial thing that you have to learn if you want to get out of the situation and so let's start by understanding a little bit about what is the situation okay so my mind has concluded that I've missed the boat right so if I miss the boat then there's no catching up all of the you know all of the the steps that I need to take I've that you know the boat has left so there's like no like way to go back in time and fix it although maybe if you're like me you wish you could go back in time and fix it you dream of time travel and if you could live your life again you would do everything right or not even everything right right you would you would make you wouldn't make that one crucial mistake that got you off on the wrong path and if you could have just boarded the train at the right time then all of the other things would have gone well so let's understand a little bit about why your mind thinks that your situation is hopeless so as you look around at all the normal people your mind is a pattern generating machine it's deductive it's analytical and by the way I see this problem more in people who have high IQ so they're able to do analysis right so you analyze all these other of people and you kind of conclude okay these are the steps that take that it is required to become successful I have all these friends they're all getting married the reason they're getting married married is because they started dating they started dating because they learned how to socialize and your mind kind of Engineers the formula for success and it's a very very good formula for Success right there's a lot of data to support that formula for success and then we kind of look at this and we conclude okay this is the right way to succeed we have overwhelming data this is the right way to succeed and then you look at your own situation and what is the natural conclusion that you come to well if this is the formula for success and it requires boarding the boat at a particular time and kind of getting off on that trajectory and I've missed that trajectory therefore I'm hopeless right and it's completely logical and you may talk to other people and other people may sort of say oh no it's it's not that big of a deal you you'll still be fine like you can do it you can do anything that you put your mind to but you don't believe that right they can say that but it doesn't sink in with you well why not and this is where you can say oh it's because I I have low self-esteem or something like that no let's be like more precise the reason that you don't believe them or because or the reason that their answers don't work for you is not because of some psychological low self-esteem although that's true in a sense it's because you've tried it that way right so if we listen to this person's experience they sort of dated someone they were cheated on right that person left them they're still a virgin so the other thing that we oftentimes forget about people who miss the boat on normalcy is they tried to live a normal life at one point or many points and anytime they tried to live a normal life they got screwed right things did not go work out in their favor I tried relationships I couldn't even get someone to stay faithful I tried doing what other people do and I failed at that crap and it's because you failed at that crap that you sort of got off on this wrong trajectory so what does the Mind naturally conclude then if people say oh just go out and try to meet people right like you got to try to meet people meet people but once again what is your mind saying your mind is saying hey we've tried this before we've done our analysis we've sort of recognized that this does not work well from us right because that's what the Mind does the Mind learns from experience so here we have our experience which is filled with difficulty and failure which is not like you know like it's not it's not wrong right that may not be a cognitive bias like those are actually your experiences if you dated someone they cheated on you and then like you know you were devastated afterward like that's actually like your reality and then your mind does analysis of other people and it concludes okay these people have lived normal lives and then what your mind does is it sits down with all this data and it comes to a conclusion there's no hope in trying right there's no point in trying that's why we're hopeless because we've concluded that okay not only is the world a painful place for us when we've tried to engage in it but furthermore now that we've missed the boat on some of these things our stats are so low we're so low level we're so far behind that further attempts to engage will result in failure and so our mind adopts hopelessness as a energy saving strategy because if we're hopeless we won't try if we don't try and failure is inevitable we're going to end up saving some energy maybe we can salvage what we can out of life and we'll certainly save ourselves from a lot of hurt so hopelessness here is not something to be it's not a problem to be solved it is the solution itself and so then the question kind of becomes okay well if I'm in this situation what can I do to change it and this is where to be honest this is the most underappreciated skill and in fact most people wouldn't even consider it a skill in fact we sort of think about we strive for the opposite which is we need to learn how to be stupid so our entire life we want to be intelligent right we want to figure out the the most important things we want to be problem solvers we want to be right we trust our intelligence we try to boost our IQ we take supplements we read books all to be smarter smarter smarter smarter smarter and what we really need to do in this situation is to be dumb to be absolutely idiotic and you may say well hold on a second what do you mean by be stupid why would I want to be stupid because let's remember that all of the conclusions that your mind comes to because it are because of its Brilliance right because you've analyzed all the lives of other people and here's the logical conclusion you come to you've analyzed all of the experiences that you've had and here's the logical conclusion you come to and if someone tries to tell you otherwise you have a thousand reasons why they're wrong oh sure you have this advice for me but it doesn't apply because of reasons a b and c it won't work for me because of a b and c and you're right right so people like they take it for granted they're like oh just go out there man like put yourself out there and it's fine if you can put yourself out there if you're a six foot three Chad or you're a beautiful you know mixed race woman that men are drooling over but what if you're not one of those people right what if you're one of the the rejects then none of that stuff works and so your mind comes to conclusions and the mind is so intelligent and it's so intelligent right so any kind of logic that you use any kind of analysis that you use even some amount of therapy or something like that doesn't work so how do you get out of the situation you become stupid become utterly idiotic because if you really think about it anytime you try to take a step forward out of your situation what does your mind do it tells you no don't do that and it gives you a thousand Reasons look at how intelligent I am the full power of your IQ is being leveraged to keep you in place so the only antidote is to be stupid because anytime you try to take a step forward your mind will give you a thousand Reasons here's all the data here's all the evidence here are all the reasons it won't work for you it won't work for you it won't work for you and so our whole lives we go trying to trust our mind trying to boost our mind trying to improve our IQ trying to learn lots of things and by the way it's also we haven't mentioned it yet but I'd say that if you're in this kind of situation I'm sure you've done lots and lots and lots of reading and exploration to try to figure out a solution right how do I thread the needle of all of my problems in life so I can use my intellect to find a way forward and the more that you use your intellect the more that you use your intellect you have one option you're like oh my God this is it I found the Magic Bullet and you do it and what happens it doesn't work and now that you've had one more failure you add that onto the pile that makes you more hopeless now you have to thread an even finer needle you have to walk an even more dangerous tightrope because now you've got one more failure weighing you down and I know it sounds kind of bizarre but there's actually very good evidence of this scientifically as well so when I work with my patients who are psychotic or who have anxiety disorders the key feature that I teach them is to learn how to distrust your mind learn how to be stupid if you have all this data that shows that the FBI is following you I was walking down the street and there was someone in a car and the second that I walked by they turned on the car and they drove away I was driving down the highway and I exited off the highway and there was one car that followed me and then I turned right into a gas station and that car turned right into the gas station too see I have all of this data so what you need to learn how to do is distrust your mind your your anxious mind tells you oh my God this is going to go wrong in this this is going to go wrong and this is going to go wrong and this is going to go wrong and if you try to argue with the person with anxiety what happens they're going to win so what you need to learn how to do is be stupid what does it mean to be stupid being stupid means for the thousand reasons that your mind is telling you no just even if it's right oh it's so smart look at how high your IQ is be stupid and let's be honest even if you're super hopeless about yourself and even if you feel terrible about yourself there's still one other question right which is what you ask yourself which is how on Earth can all these [ __ ] idiots do so well in life when I struggle so damn hard they're such idiots and they're out there living life well there's your answer it's not that them being idiots makes it harder for them to live life it makes it easier for them to live life right so learn how to be a little bit stupid learn how to distrust your mind a little bit if your mind is telling you that something is a good idea consider doing the opposite even if your mind tells you there's no point this is doomed to failure don't bother and when we listen to the intelligence of the mind when we listen to the analysis when we listen to the Brilliance we are being so smart and we play the game of analysis and trying to figure out the perfect answer instead of just being stupid and there are lots of situations like this right so I can only imagine that I I mean I have no idea but you know there's this famous kind of story of Bill Gates dropping out of Harvard and once you get into Harvard University like oh my God how idiotic is it to drop out so much of what we Crave in life seems stupid from the outside even my own story I struggled so hard to get into Medical School struggled so hard in medical school to get into a top residency became faculty at a top institution and invested so much in this and walked away to do what to do this it's idiotic to walk away from such opportunity oh my God so I'd encourage you to stop trying to figure things out so elegantly stop trying to be so smart and instead be a little bit idiotic be a little bit stupid you'll be amazed at where it gets you foreign
