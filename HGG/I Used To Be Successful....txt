okay i used to be successful and now i'm not so i feel absolutely shattered i'm 28 years old and it's like my career peaked five years ago from ages of 23 to 25 i got articles published in the wall street journal the huffington post in los angeles times signed a book deal and had a job writing a politics newsletter for 30 000 subscribers working three blocks from the white house now i struggle to make 20k a year and can't find anyone willing to hire me the company i worked for went under in 2017 and we were all laid off i took some remote writing jobs but they weren't a fit experimented with being a professional poker player for a while and now here i am trying to get back into the job market and can't seem to break through i submit job applications like it's a full-time job i've gotten a few interviews and really close to certain positions but they always seem to pick a different candidate at the final round my self-esteem is rapidly diminishing i used to feel like i was unique and had a lot to offer my whole life people told me i had all these talents and gifts sounding familiar chat but i feel i'm left feeling entirely unwanted by the professional world i'm starting to seriously question if it was all a lie if i'm so special why can't i even get an email back emails emails emails all i do is send mother emails i'm getting cynical and sad starting to feel like the job market is a gamified scam like dating apps promising connections but mostly resulting in poor superficial matches and the only ones that work out are dumb luck i'm actually married now but all these job rejections remind me of the misery and rejections of dating apps i used to experience one of us has got to be in the wrong here either a the job market can't seem to recognize me as a motivated intelligent candidate or b i'm not nearly as special or accomplished as i thought i was in this rejection is completely deserved professionally speaking i am worthless so i don't know if this is option b or this is a conclusion so this is unfortunately something that actually happens a lot to people so we've talked about gifted kids right so we've talked about people who are told from a young age that they're gifted and talented and often oftentimes what we find is that gifted kids run into a wall and when they run into a wall they really start to struggle because their whole sense of identity is built off of being gifted and how are the how do people tell them that they're gifted why do people tell them that they're gifted well that's because you know they um it's usually due to performance so like when i write you know the best essay in the class in the seventh grade someone tells me wow you are a really talented writer and so i think oh okay so like my value as a human being is because i'm gifted and i'm gifted because i'm a talented writer and then that kind of perpetuates right in ninth grade i write another really good essay as well i'm gifted i'm gifted i'm gifted and then even sometimes with gifted kids they start to flounder a little bit in in let's say high school because they haven't developed study habits because they are actually like very talented or very intelligent or something like that so you don't develop the supporting skills which means that at some point you like hit a wall because either you can jump right over it or you kind of run into it because you never learned how to climb right so it's either like a full clear or like a full stop and so that's where sometimes like we run into problems in high school that's where i started to have problems i certainly had problems in college and had to like learn how to study and apply myself and then we also see this kind of situation where people you know do really good and then they may go to college and do well in college and then they like in their first phase of their professional career they get like a lot of really prestigious things right so wall street general huffing huffington post l.a times signed a book deal working three days three blocks from the white house and so then sometimes what happens is that these people too so now like you sort of get that you know you're gifted right look at the look at the world look at the accolades that i have that's how i know that i have value and then if something goes wrong like you know if the company goes under in 2017 and then what happens is like since your sense of identity is built up through being gifted talented and your accolades the moment your accolades go away the moment your accomplishments go away your self-esteem goes with it so this unfortunately is a all too common experience and it absolutely sucks to go through and the good news is that like just because you have been successful in the past and are now hitting a wall does not mean that you don't have value does not mean that you aren't brilliant the reason that we feel this way is because our determination of our brilliance is based on external factors right so like our sense of our value as a human being is based on the kind of rewards that the world gives us and so if you're in this kind of situation this is actually a really really good opportunity to like grow as a person and really start to figure out like who you are and what you can be proud of that is independent of what the rest of the world appreciates so what i'd like to do is talk a little bit about this situation and sort of like go into more detail okay so the first thing that we're going to do is talk a little bit about the psychology of like what's going on with self-esteem right so i sort of explained some of it now um but so we're going to talk a little bit about like how do we build ourselves up where does self-esteem come from how is it reinforced and then sometimes if if our karma if our circumstances change how that can pull the rug out from under our self-esteem and then if that situation happens where things aren't hunky-dory everything isn't fantastic now how can you start to go about the process of like getting your self-esteem back and how can you start the process of exploring where self-esteem truly comes from because self-esteem does not come from the washington post does not come from the la times does not come from working three blocks from the white house self-esteem comes from the self the problem is that this person does not have self-esteem they have esteem they have external esteem right so how do we start to work on our self-esteem the last thing that i'd like to talk a little bit about and this is something that our community has been increasingly both asking for and also appreciating is some practical tips right so if we look at this post for a moment there's a lot of like really practical stuff here so like emails emails emails so either the job market can't seem to recognize me as a motivated intelligent candidate or i'm not as accomplished or special as i thought so like we're going to talk actually a little bit about practicalities of like what does the job market actually look for right and if you are someone who is talented and has a real contribution to make does the job market actually care about that like when you're sending out thousands of emails to companies that are getting thousands of applications do they really care about whether you're talented gifted brilliant are they even giving you a fair shake on that and what do what do a job but what do employers actually look for like what's the purpose of a job application and so i'd like to end with a couple of almost practical tips right so how can you kind of start with psychology and then like apply that to the practical steps that you're gonna take going forward okay so let's get started so does that sound good okay so um we're gonna start with sort of like the psychology of esteem okay so let's go here so let's talk about the psychology of esteem so we kind of went through this a little bit kind of sort of a spoiler alert but here's the first thing to understand so our sense of self-worth comes from two places it can come from the outside or from the inside and the interesting thing is if you look at things like attachment theory the the really interesting thing is that originally when we're very young our internal sense of self-worth actually comes from the outside and this is like when we're super young like you know because a child doesn't really know what is an accomplishment and what is not an accomplishment so the way that we're treated the way that we're valued will sort of determine our sense of esteem so for example some children are are given conditional love so what this sort of means is like the love and support and and uh reinforcement that i get actually has to do with like my performance right so if i perform i'm loved and i'm valued and i'm respected and some kids are given unconditional love and this is where like we can still appreciate performance but the value that you bring as a human being is actually transcendent beyond your performance so i'll give y'all just a a you know we have transcendent value so i'll give y'all just a simple example right so oh you did like you did such a great job i'm so proud of you that's awesome i love it when you get a's you're the smartest kid in the class you're so gifted you're so awesome so your value is based on getting an a being gifted being talented etc so we see this a lot with gifted kids the next thing like let's kind of use the uh a kind of a different example of unconditional love right which is like let's say i get a b so in the case of a gifted kid like why didn't you get an a you need to study harder you need to work harder you need to stop playing video games it's important to get an a get an a get an a get an a whereas if we have sort of a a situation where we have unconditional love it's like it's okay to make mistakes and we care about you anyway right so it's sort of like saying like your value as a human being doesn't matter like whether you get an a or a b i love you either way i really hope that you can study a little bit harder i'm gonna try to help you right it's not just your fault that you gotta be as a parent i recognize that like if there's something that you're not able to do maybe i have a hand in that and so i sort of because because here's the thing when it comes to gifted kids in conditional love the success or failure is all theirs right they own it all it's your responsibility there's a lot of self-reliance on improvement so if it's like if it's a success it's your success but if it's a failure it's your failure whereas in the cases of unconditional love hopefully you'll have parents who will sort of share responsibility with you right hey it's not all your fault it's not like you're an idiot because you gotta be maybe i need to be doing better as a parent maybe i need to make sure that you're doing your homework maybe i need to teach you something maybe i need to talk to you about why school is hard and when you say say all of those things to a child what the child sort of recognizes is that the problem is not just here right there are all kinds of these things like study habits parental support and the more that parents sort of acknowledge that this is responsible for outcomes the easier it is to be assured of who you are on the inside right this is a problem that can be fixed it's not intrinsic value based on like whether you got an a or a b so this is how things start so we'll sort of you know some people will be raised this way some people will be raised predominantly this way it's like oftentimes both right but there's like it tends to be a mix of it and then when we sort of end up with conditional oven by the way there's a whole video about that in dr k's guide if you all are interested the problem of conditional love um then what happens is that we tend to be a little bit performance oriented right so we we can work hard we can be motivated right because my value as a human being depends on my performance so in order to feel good i need to get an a right so when we sort of in that so people will be very very motivated they'll actually be very successful in the case of conditional love because like just think about it for a second in the case of conditional love whether you get love or not is conditional and do you want love do you need love is it a basic human need absolutely so i'm going to try my level best to meet those requirements right so these people tend to be very performance oriented and then like this can escalate so it starts with a's and then it's wall street journal then it's book deal right so each of these things that happen and we can even look at this post when this person talks about you know their value as a human being they don't say i wrote some really brilliant articles they don't say i wrote some stuff that is like beautiful prose i did some awesome investigative journalism i did some epic i did some amazing political analysis right so they don't actually talk about the value of their work do you all see that what they talk about is the accolades of their work so there's no intrinsic value it's about how the value was received and once you do that then suddenly this is not about what you wrote right it's how the world received what you wrote so then what happens is your esteem is based on external factors and so what does that mean for us right that means that if the world stops loving us or we stop getting like positive reinforcement from the world our esteem is going to go from it because our esteem is not internal it's not self-esteem it's external esteem right so like i'll give you all just a quick example so let's say that you know a lot of people are concerned about the way they look and how comfortable they are in their body so you know and a lot of that is determined it's not actually like how comfortable you are in your body and how okay you are with your appearance people may assume for a moment that that comfort depends on how people treat you so if people call you beautiful like surely that person will be more confident the truth of the matter is that that's not actually the case right that you can have beautiful people who are comfortable in their body and you can have beautiful people who are insecure about their looks and the insecure people require external validation right so some like models for example male or female or non-binary or whatever like they will require constant validation from partners friends whatever about how amazing they look and the reason that they they do that is because their sense of like pride in their appearance actually comes from the external world because you'll have some people who are pretty average looking who are actually like pretty content with the way they look right they don't actually need external validation to make them comfortable in their own skin they recognize i'm not the most beautiful person on the planet i'm not the ugliest person on the planet uh i do what i can you know i i get my hair done well i try to exercise i try to you know buy clothing that's flattering like i'm gonna like groom myself properly and like i'm never gonna be a supermodel and that's okay right so confidence is not actually about the way the world treats you and the problem is that if you're someone who has grown up gifted if you're someone who is performed and then the world stops giving you validation then there's a crisis of confidence in that crisis of confidence is characterized by a loss of self-esteem but once again it's not self-esteem right it's a loss of esteem and this is where you know the real antidote is to start to develop self-esteem and we'll get to the how in a second i recognize it's not just just so develop self-esteem chat so and here's the thing that i want to point out is that this person why doesn't this person have self-esteem it's because they've never had they've never needed it right so like our body doesn't you know my biceps aren't just like ripped because i'm sitting around clicking the mouse my biceps grow when i like exercise with them right so when i lift against a resistance my body adapts by growing the muscle and our esteem is the same way so as long as you've gotten like a lot of esteem from the external world you will never need to have developed self-esteem right and so like this isn't an issue of like you're a bad person or you're a good person or you're you know professionally worthless like that's not what it's about it's just simply that thus far in your life you haven't really needed to develop self-esteem because you've gotten plenty of esteem from the outside world so your brain and your body are very very economical so they're not going to like waste time developing things that are unused right so you like you think about a child who's learning a language like learning your first language is incredibly critical because you need to be able to communicate but once you like learn a language it's not like your brain is struggling to learn a second language right because now you your needs are met and if your needs are met there's no point in changing anything so then the question becomes you know how do i start to develop self-esteem and so this is where i want to point out like a couple of things that you can sort of do the first is to you know track back to where does your esteem truly come from and so what i would ask this person is like when you were riding high what were you proud of how did you know that you were doing a good job and i know it sounds kind of weird but even that exploration that acknowledgement of like what made you proud what made you know that you could bring value to the world was it what you wrote or the fact that you were writing for the wall street journal right and the more that you sort of start to ask you know like where did i derive value because here's the key thing so at the age of 23 to 25 wall street journal white house la times right and then let's say 26 to 28 i think they are now right how old are they 28 yeah okay so from 20 26 to 28 none of those things so here's the thing if you want to build self-esteem here let's say that your goal is to build self-esteem going forward this is actually not the right place to start because the lack of self-esteem actually started here right this is where you determined what your esteem was based on so a lot of people will say like okay in the present right so we advocate for doing stuff in the present like we teach meditation and stuff so you can do all that stuff by all means we've gone into ahmgar and identity and like how to discover who you truly are and stuff like that but i think the other thing so we're going to add on to that today the other thing is that you have to go back to the past and try to figure out like where did i build my self-esteem because oddly enough what you need to do is deconstruct your esteem from here right because as long as your esteem is determined by external things like there's not space for you to develop self-esteem so oftentimes when i work with people and i saw this a lot you know at different institutions that are like very very high performing right so like investment banks private equity firms like places like goldman sachs and stuff like that i'd have clients from those kinds of places and what i sort of discover is that the way that and they would be like 30 let's say and they're coming in they have a crisis of confidence because they just got fired for the first time in their life and they went to yale and then they went got a mba from from yale and then they went to you know wharton for this some other thing and then like so it's just like success through and through and then 30 they get fired for the first time or they get a bad performance review or they don't get promoted and then they're like spinning in the wind and the solution is to actually go back and actually deconstruct where your esteem originally came from right and this is where you want to ask yourself like you know where does my value come from here and hopefully what you can discover is that it's not the la times that made you good right the la times maybe a seal of approval absolutely but that's all it is right it's not the real value the real value is in what you wrote so like the reason that the la times is publishing your stuff it's not the la times that makes you good it's because you are good that the la times will publish your stuff it's not the accolades are not the reason you are good they are a consequence of your good so this is where we're going to talk for a second about karma or karma right so what comes first the la times into the good writing or the good writing into the la times and this comes first so what part are you responsible for you're responsible for this right so absolutely like once you start writing for the la times maybe you get better and you have good editors and stuff like that and you improve so there's like some amount of reciprocal stuff right but like the reason that you made it there is because you were writing really well like you you know and sure there's like a stepwise kind of thing where you did good in english class right english honors and then journalism at columbia and then you wrote your first piece for the huffpo and then you wrote your next piece for the new york times and you improved over time like absolutely right and and did the new york times look at your writing because you had written for huffpo sure but here's the thing they may have looked at it but the writing had to be good like the new york times is not going to publish you just because you wrote for huffpo the reason that the new york times is going to publish you is because like you wrote something good and so you're the truth is the more that you tunnel down into how the world gives you accolades the more hopefully you come to the conclusion this is where i really encourage you to think about it are you actually a good writer even if you come to the answer no what i'll often times see with people that i've worked with is okay let's get better right because i know are you a good writer and so sometimes people will come to this kind of conclusion they're like actually no i'm not a good writer but i have written well in the past and that's even healthier like you can't be a good writer or a bad writer like the truth is that i am capable of writing well and the neat thing is once you adopt that attitude it's like okay how do i get there again what did i do when i was writing for the la times how can i get better at this and so this all moves towards an action orientation a growth mindset we've sort of talked a little bit about that on wednesday right so you all can watch those vods and stuff if you want to and the last thing that i kind of want to point out and this is why i'm sort of bringing up karma is that now this person is in a situation where let's assume for a moment they're capable of writing well right and so if people are not hiring you does that mean i am bad so i want you all to think about this for a second let's say i am a gardener okay and i'm really good at garden i'm a skilled gardener and then what i have over here is very fertile soil right so a lot of good soil and then what i ever i have over here is a barren desert um feeling minecraftish today with rocks okay so let's say that these are the two options my skill at gardening is the same when i plant seeds over here they turn into plants when i plant seeds over here doesn't matter how many i plant don't turn into anything what does that say about my skill as a gardener right so maybe even i'm really good i can get a little bit of a plant here but this is the key thing that we sometimes forget right is that all we're entitled to as human beings are our actions and our outcomes don't necessarily determine our skill so if you're like working in an environment where it sounds like this person was at a you know company until 2017 everyone was laid off right so like let's just think about that for a second like it sounds like the company was doing well but everyone got laid off so there may be like industry-wide changes that affected journalism so i think journalism has been on the struggle bus for a while right as an industry so like this used to be the thing where the new york times would like have subscriptions to the newspaper so they had like revenue because people needed to read the newspaper and along came the internet and like now things are behind paywalls and like you know people used to have subscriptions but people don't i don't know how many people have subscriptions to the new york times anymore and so with things like the internet and the free availability of information and the transition to advertising and stuff like that like the whole industry got changed and so this company went under in 2017 um and so then like you know like things changed so this is where you need to be careful so now we're going to kind of get to the practical side of things the first thing is like so do all this stuff by all means but then also recognize that just because you're not getting a job doesn't mean that you're bad at what you do right this has nothing to do with this team there are karmic industry-wide phenomenon that may be happening which are essentially moving you in this direction as opposed to this direction now if the gardener works over here for a while is not careful they will conclude that they are a bad gardener which may not be correct right it may not be fair it doesn't mean that there aren't things you can work on so now what we're going to sort of do so i i just want to set that frame because i think this is really really important that your value doesn't necessarily have to do with the way that the world treats you and this is where the person says like i can't tell if i'm a talented writer or not right so let's kind of just look at that for a second oh so let's look over here um so getting cynical and sad either the job market can't seem to recognize me as a motivated intelligent candidate or i'm not nearly as special or accomplished as i thought right like either i'm a good either the the world can't see what i have to offer or i don't have anything to offer which makes perfect sense right it's a very good question so let's talk a little bit about that so like when you're emailing emailing emailing this is what you do all day every day what do people look for right so what does do emails and like submitting resumes and stuff like does that look for brilliance right so like when we do paper applications like let's think a little bit about it sounds like this person is emailing so i'm assuming they're applying to online jobs and what do y'all think an online employer is looking for right so this is where as a society as we become more outcome oriented which isn't necessarily bad right there are advantages and disadvantages what we've started to do is use proxies for talent or skill because we we don't have like so here's the thing i'm going to post a job i'm going to get 2 000 applications i don't have time to read 2 000 pieces of writing so what i'm going to do is start to use substitutes start to use cordless which school did you go to where have you written in the past you know so i'm going to use all these correlates for brilliance because when you apply for a job no one ever like if i'm applying to be like an engineer no one asks how much engineering do you know right i mean they may ask in later forms of the interview but like generally speaking at the application phase like no one is like do you understand engineering that's not a part of the job interview it's like where have you worked before what was your gpa where did you go to school and we use all of those as proxies for skill so in this person's case like let's try to think a little bit about why this person may be running into problems okay new york times l.a times huffpo professional poker player right so like imagine you're an employer let's compare you to person number two let's say san antonio chronicle let's say uh what's another florida gazette and let's say huffpo who are you gonna hire right it's like what what are you getting here so this person made it to final round interviews so i'm also curious a little bit about the numbers game because it's the other thing to understand about online employers it's just a numbers game right so if we if if i have like 50 applicants for one position like what is the percentage chance that i get a job offer it's like raw raw it's like uh two percent right but i have 50 applicants but here's the thing if we look at a list of candidates that go from 50 to one it's not like each of these people gets one application right the the person who's at the top of the list is going to get like 80 invitations and the person at the bottom list is going to get 0 and so as this person gets a job then 49 number 49 will have an 80 and the number 48 will have an 80 right and so he goes out and then he goes out or she goes out and so it's not like actually probabilistically even across the spread because invitations get given to the people at the top of the list and so the fact that the person has gotten a couple of interviews tells me that this person should keep applying because like once you get to the interview stage then you know you're you're actually like a good applicant when people are interviewing you that means that what you have on your resume is sufficient for us to hire you now we're going to try to get a feel for who you are and this is where the psychology comes back in because when you are this and when you are concerned about this when this is what's in your head when this is what's in your head when this is what's in your head how strong do you think you interview right so what is the purpose of an interview let's we talked about emails for a second this is something that i don't know that people have kind of explained so oftentimes interviews are sort of about you know they're kind of like skills assessments in a sense right so it's like oh you know it's a skills assessment let's see how brilliant you are but that's not just what interviews are about interviews are incredibly limbic they're incredibly empathic and incredibly like subsurface brain stuff right it's not like consciously it's like you're going to meet people you're like yeah i liked that guy all right yeah she was super cool they were really awesome what is that what are people picking up would that person be fun to work with so i remember when i was training in residency like we would have medical students rotate through so these were audition rotations so people wanted to do residency you know at this at this hospital so people would like come and they'd like audition for a month and they'd come and work there and some of them were like brilliant on paper and then like you work with them and it's sort of like i remember asking questions like my colleagues and i would ask questions to each other and it's like would you want to be supervising this person overnight on call and for some people despite the fact that they were absolutely brilliant on paper the answer was absolutely not this person would be a nightmare to work with right so that's where like understand that i know it sounds kind of weird but like interviews are not just skills assessments there's some weird emotional limbic kind of stuff going on and that's where so people may see like okay then am i screwed and the answer is no absolutely not you're not screwed because all you have to do is like do this stuff right you have to start to think through and recognize that actually you bring value to the table if you like you can't fake you know maybe you can fake one article for the huffington post but if you've written for the la times new york times huffington post and had a political newsletter that had 30 000 subscribers there's something absolutely legitimate to what you bring to the table and if you cannot access that in an interview then your chances of interviewing are going to be like lower right so you can kind of fake it till you make it but i think the really awesome thing would be like if you can really dig down and do the psychological work before you go into the interview and recognize that oh like this is actually my situation that i'm actually a brilliant gardener and that you know i had really really fertile fields before and now it's like kind of barren like i struggled for a little bit right and that's okay so this is the kind of thing where i would say like even in interviews like i don't know what this person says when they ask them like you know um what were you what have you been doing for the last four years they're like yeah i tried being a professional poker player and so this is where you could sort of say something like you know i'd own it and i'd say something like you know so i i wrote for the new york times washington post etc like i really enjoyed that kind of thing and then i tried doing some freelance writing but what i really realized is that like i love writing collaboratively like i can write but in terms of what really gets me excited and what allows me to write pieces that are incredibly compelling that move people is when i'm working with a team or in some kind of environment that's like better structure like the new york times or whatever you make it make that up and what i'm really looking for is that kind of environment because that's what allows me to write at my highest level and when you say something like that like someone's across the other side of the table it's like that's pretty good right you can't it's you have to be able to authentically own it so i don't think you should i don't think you should lie everyone's saying just lie no don't lie like this is why you do the introspective work so that you can say something authentically right and when you say something authentically what it's going to access is this weird like limbic stuff and when you can own it you're like yeah i tried some other stuff for a while but what i really discovered is i truly love writing and i miss writing and this is actually what i want to do for the rest of my life and when you can own that right that that's what you should say so it's not just a lie what you should do is say whatever you can own through the introspective process okay right is there a couple of other things to just consider before we kind of wrap up one is um you know so i would also do a couple of things one is get feedback this is really important so if you're like hitting your head against a wall in terms of applying for a job you know are people reviewing your application who's i mean presumably a pretty good writer right but it can still be useful to have people like take a look at stuff and maybe this person has already done that right so you can also get feedback from prospective employers you may kind of strike out here but you can even ask people hey so i noticed that y'all went in a different direction can you help me understand what the uh you know the person who got the job what did they have or what did you like about them more that than me right so what what were y'all looking for that i was sort of lacking that someone else had and you may get some you may not get any answer at all you may get some vague answer like a cultural fit or things like that um and and sometimes hopefully you'll find someone nice who will actually like give you some information but you don't know until you ask so you can you can even try to so get feedback from colleagues things like that the other thing is when it comes to getting feedback so if you have written for the la times new york times huffpo you may know people there right so i would ask them and say hey i'm trying to get back into writing and like the job market seems super rough do you have any advice this is where also kind of generic things so networking so this is where like i think that if you are someone who is brilliant but just has some kind of like yellow flag on your resume right so i think this person fits this really really well where solid right here this is like you know gold star level and this over here is like kind of a yellow flag so if you're someone like this this is where you make the the emails and the resumes are not going to be your strongest showing potentially right it depends on writing cover letters and things like that so this is where like i i'd really try hard to network and people may be like what is networking we may do some some videos about that or something like that soon but this is where like because ultimately what you want to do is develop human relationships because human relationships are still really really important in terms of like decision making and who we hire right so this is where i i'd consider like joining a professional organization so people like what are the basics of this like join a professional organization i know people sometimes hate this thing but linkedin is actually can be really good right so you like like how is your linkedin profile like what's going on there and this were like just meet people and this is where you don't necessarily want to um and so when people are saying you know that's why i say join a professional organization because a professional organization will have events that you go to and you try to like learn whatever you need to learn there and you'll meet people as a result because i think the problem is that the email situation is where there's like it's just a thousand faceless applicants so which faceless applicant looks the who's the prettiest who has the prettiest face and a pile of people without faces right so that's what's that's the competition you've gotten if you're kind of non-traditional like you want people you want to meet people if you can last thing that i'll sort of say is that you know if you are running into a brick wall we kind of this is a little bit about feedback as well but um uh yeah we talked a little bit about getting feedback so you can also use these connections in terms of networking so if you know anyone at the la times if you had an editor or something like that even if it's been a couple of years they may remember you so i reach out to them right so pull on your network and say hey like you were my editor for one or two years or even if you've got relationships like if from people at school like you can even email professors and stuff you kind of can kind of ask them like hey this is the situation i'm in what would you recommend last thing that we're going to talk about is is you know running into a wall so we talked about feedback but i'm just going to give you all kind of a simple example so let's say that i'm trying to date and despite many dating apps and a couple of first dates right so tons of emails few interviews thousand emails ten interviews thousand dates i mean sorry thousand matches ten dates zero second dates so this is why feedback is really important because like sometimes the problem here is that like you've got body odor right so there may be something going on that you're not aware of but which is heavily heavily influencing your outcomes right so i'm not trying to be insulting here but like that's just the best example i can kind of think of where there may just be something that you're missing so like you just didn't realize that maybe you know you've got some bo and similarly here there may be something in this process either in the way that you interview or the way that you do your resume like that you just aren't aware of and it's not your fault and this is the kind of thing where it's like okay just put on deodorant the problem's fixed it's not like you know bo is just it's what i thought of i recognize it's kind of insulting in a sense but this is the kind of thing where like you know having worked with people who have had body odor having had body odor myself when i was like 13 years old and before i understood deodorant this is like something that i struggled with or i was like oh my god i didn't realize like one of my friends was kind enough and was like hey man you stink i was like what is that because like i didn't know right like i hit puberty and like i started my body started changing and i didn't really realize like that i smelled bad and so then i it's just something you got to learn right and i like i thank that dude to this day it's like one of the best pieces of feedback that i've gotten so there may be some simple mistake you're making but unless you ask people like you don't really know right so just to kind of summarize it's unfortunately very common that people used to be successful and now they're not so if we look at these people like the general profile is that they're told from a young age oftentimes that they have all these talents and gifts and sometimes what they do is they hit a wall in terms of like school or college where where you know they didn't never develop study habits so they like go from straight a's to like c's and then f's and then don't know what to do but what's just as common or even more common is that we end up with this sort of situation where they're actually successful right so they have prestigious accomplishments and things like that totally fine and then something happens where unfortunately they move from fertile soil in lots of progress to barren soil where even though their skill as a writer or gardener is the same the results that they get start to change and when the results start to change they start to lose self-esteem because when it comes down to self-esteem we get our self-esteem from the outside world or inside world and it's not even self-esteem their sense of esteem comes from external accolades and when you take the external accolades away your esteem goes with it so this is where you need the process of sort of discovering self-esteem right you never needed to before because the rest of the world told you how awesome you are so you never needed self-esteem so how do you do that process you start by actually deconstructing your old sense of esteem where did i do where when i thought i was the hottest [ __ ] in the world where did i derive that sense of value from right where does my value come from and hopefully through that process what you'll sort of discover is that the la times doesn't make you a good writer but it's that because you were a good writer that the la times picked up your stuff to begin with so the value is inherent in your work and it's just the external world that sort of gave you the approval and once you sort of figure that out then you can approach things with confidence and when you go into interviews the limbic response that people limbic means emotional limbic system is what governs our emotions the emotional response people are going to give to you in interviews if you're confident in yourself since you've done that work since you've developed some self-esteem is going to be very different and allow you to sort of succeed more a couple of other practical tips you know if you're running into trouble sort of moving forward you can always get feedback right ask people to review your applications maybe even feedback from employers you can reach out to old connections and sort of share your situation with them and see if they have any suggestions see if they know anyone who's looking for a writer because a personal recommendation goes a long way you can join professional organizations or do stuff on linkedin related to networking i know like people are like uh networking the truth is sometimes it matters and why is that it's because if you're sort of a non-traditional applicant or you've got a yellow flag because you haven't been writing for the last four years the email application is not going to be the best way to showcase who you are and put your best foot forward so that's why in person stuff matters more you need people to look past some of these things in your application to recognize that there's someone really valuable underneath and that happens in person questions what if there's not somebody valuable behind the cv that's exactly my point is that your sense of value is not determined by the cv right so this is where you know i believe all human beings have value i think each and every one of you has something to contribute to the world and i didn't come to that conclusion just because i'm like try to be a good person and see the positive i genuinely think that so let me like make a case for a second so if we think about the contributions that people come up with let's talk about innovation for example so innovation requires a certain set of experiences to happen right so if we think about the wright brothers there's a certain constellation of experiences they had that created the opportunity for them to invent the airplane you can't have the wright brothers today because the airplane's already been invented that boat has sailed and if that's sort of true what that means is that each and every one of you has a completely unique circumstance right you have a completely unique set of experiences background the times you live in today the age you are what you've done what you haven't done you your experiences and the neurons in your brain are capable of creating something that is statistically impossible for someone else to make because no one else knows exactly what you know and has lived exactly what you've lived and when we think about innovation and where like understanding and stuff comes from it's like from what we've learned right so if i've read these 10 books i'm able to form these 10 conclusions if i've read a different 10 books i will come to different 10 conclusions and so this is the key thing this is what i sort of figured out in my life is like you know like my contribution to the world is based on the opportunities that i was given and the same is true for all y'all as well and you may think like oh but what can i possibly contribute all i do is you know playing games all day and like i'm someone who failed out of college because i was grinding diablo 2 in warcraft 3. and like i still found a contribution and so can you right it's just thinking a little bit about like like i really do believe this and this is why i like even when we kind of talk a little bit about you know people who come on stream each person who comes on stream has a unique perspective and what we do is like share that perspective and we can all benefit from it right you
