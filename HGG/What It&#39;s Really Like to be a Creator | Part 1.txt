I spent a lot of time checking out tons of streams and I didn't see a lot of brown people um I don't still to this day I don't when I find one it's like finding your unicorn welcome everyone hello hello super excited to be here having us um so welcome welcome so I'm gonna start with this like so I I guess in a second we're gonna introduce ourselves but before we even do that what's y'all's understanding of what we're doing here like what are we doing here and like why are we doing it does anyone have any idea I I have a decent idea I mean obviously we're all like creators right so we have we all have we all have something in common there and there's a lot of interesting topics that we can talk about in relation to that sure bring our own experiences to the table and stuff like that absolutely I I was under the distinct impression that you were going to be our Nick Fury and we were going to form the Avengers but I am somewhat of a pseudo Boomer so I don't understand that reference can someone please explain [Laughter] I haven't seen any of them [Laughter] no better time like the present that's what I've been doing who can explain to me what metric seconds was is saying so there's this uh there's this uh IP called Marvel have the Avengers okay they they have the Avengers which is like a group of superheroes from all sorts of different backgrounds and stuff and they come together under Nick Fury's lead and that's the best way I can describe it okay okay and so it's like Smash Brothers but in the film industry yeah that's helpful yes and anyone else have something that they want to add about kind of what we're doing here or what the goal is or what you know what y'all are or does that pretty much something yeah go ahead maybe to like give an insight as well and [Music] it's not always like the front that we put on there's like a lot that kind of goes on behind absolutely very well said Ruby true so here's how I would describe what we're doing here so I in my background which I'll get to in a little bit but so I've been an educator and in a formal sense and I've also been a clinician so I work with patients sometimes and one of the things that I found was that there's like education and then there's like practical application so you can tell someone so I ran a program that sort of trained physicians in Wellness okay so we trained like 600 people in wellness and what we sort of found is that there's a difference between like giving lectures On Wellness like oh like let's talk about how to be well like oh you should meditate every day and like you can give people information about being well but the translation of that information into application into their lives was very challenging so when I think about coaching what I really think about is a practical application of information and so what we're going to be doing here I have a curriculum but thankfully you guys don't have to do homework or worksheets or things like that so I've got a curriculum of essentially eight or nine topics which we're going to touch on hopefully over the course of eight weeks but instead of going through them like one at a time okay today we're going to be talking about burnout here's what leads to burnout today we're going to be talking about dealing with toxicity from your community today we're going to talk about how being a content creator means that your work is never done right because how do you know when you're it's enough to like you've streamed enough how do you know when the thumbnail for your Youtube upload is good enough right so there are a lot of unique challenges that content creators face which we actually understand pretty well here at healthy gamer because we've worked with about 300 or 400 content creators at this point so we've synthesized all of that experience into something of a curriculum instead of just teaching it though what we tend to find is the most useful way to sort of really dig in and understand that is through y'all's experiences and so as Ruby was kind of saying and I hope that's okay that I call you that for now until we introduce you and you tell us how you're referred to is that we're going to sort of hear from y'all's perspective sort of hear about the challenges that you face educate not only like your community members about what it's like to be a content creator educate aspiring content creators but also educate all the other content creators right about what is it like to struggle with and then hopefully in terms of as we go through curriculum what'll do what will happen is that any creators who are out there watching can hopefully benefit from it so that's a part of like the AOE healing approach that we have at healthygamer which is that we're going to work through problems together here and in doing so hopefully help people out in the audience any questions about that okay now so a couple of quick boundaries and kind of layout sort of stuff so we're going to be meeting for about 90 minutes once a week for a period of eight weeks everyone kind of familiar with that so sometimes on this stream we'll have uh interviews group streams things like that where people will discuss personal things that's totally fine if you guys feel like discussing personal stuff you can if you want to discuss issues related to Psychiatry mental health mental illness that's totally fair game but just to be clear we're not necessarily going to be looking for that so this is not like uh you know tell us about all your deep traumas on the internet if it applies to your job as a content creator you're welcome to share whatever you feel comfortable with but does everyone understand that I'm not going to be doing diagnostic assessments on anyone I'm not going to be providing treatment to anyone or anything like that we clear on that hopefully within the next week you guys should be getting a communication from someone on our team about if anyone feels like they do need clinical help or Support over the course of these eight weeks y'all can let us know we'll do our best to make a referral or find resources in your area or things like that but we can't guarantee that we can you know sort of we're certainly not going to provide treatment and we can't guarantee that we can find you someone but we'll do our best to help everyone clear on that there'll be more details hopefully within the next week okay thank you um so everyone cool in terms of boundaries there you don't have to discuss anything that you don't want to all right so other things so normally when we run groups there are a couple things that are different so normally we'll sort of say that like you know there's an entitlement to privacy right so what discusses what we discuss in group stays in the group there's an obvious exception to that because everyone is aware that we're live streaming this right this is the kind of thing where I want us to all be responsible for protecting everyone else in the group so I know it sounds kind of weird but like if someone if you feel like someone is becoming uncomfortable with something that we're discussing anyone here can put the brakes on the group and say hey are we sure we really want to discuss this is like do you feel safe do you feel comfortable everyone kind of okay with that okay yep so um I'm gonna keep going and we'll get to introductions I promise so we're gonna try to like learn stuff and grow and change over the course of this group are we kind of familiar with that so the first question that I have is who is responsible for change in the group ourselves ourselves yeah okay uh wait is there a girl who are you pointing at I was playing anybody so so hold on a second so let's let's tunnel down into that so is there a girl do you believe that you are responsible for change in the group do you believe that Zell is responsible for your change or do you believe that all of the above all the above absolutely that's the right answer so this is something that I think is really important generally speaking when we go through life we are the ones that are responsible for change right it's on me so part of why I love group is actually like this is different I want each and every one of you to understand that there are five other people in this call and four of those people you are also responsible for helping right so I'm responsible for teaching y'all stuff helping you move forward in life you're responsible for yourself but you are also responsible for everyone else in the group how do people feel about that sounds good really is that normal have you all been in a situation like that before no but I trust you I mean I just moved in with a bunch of uh like uh of my friends from the twitch sector so I it's kind of like that where like we're all just kind of like in this together you know so awesome kind of the same thing with this okay so a couple of other things so we asked y'all to bring three things so we have three core values at healthy gamer that we ask people to bring to the table and these are going to be a little bit weird so the first is compassion the second is authenticity and the third is presence okay so these are the values that we ask you all to bring to the table so we want you all to be authentic and compassionate in here so I doubt this is going to be a situation here because you know we're all live streaming and stuff but generally speaking like you know don't alt tab like pay attention as best as you can if you struggle with attentional issues or something like that you're welcome to bring that up with the group but you know we're all going to kind of be here and mindful as best as we can there may be exceptions if someone's dog runs in or you know someone's mom calls and that's totally fine but generally speaking we ask you all to do that the other thing that I kind of want to point out is that we want you all to be authentic and compassionate but not necessarily polite what do you all think what's the difference between being authentic and compassionate and being polite I don't know in my mind it kind of comes down to like I don't know like toxic positivity like being being too like too kind about like I don't know not not being willing to like open up the the door of honesty you know or I guess authenticity which is the whole difference factor of it yeah oh go for it sorry [ __ ] being polite sometimes can um I'm I'm British so I'm really good at being polite but also it can almost cut off or like if it cuts off your own feelings as well because you're just being polite you're not actually saying you know you just say things to be polite thank you that's how you go through life like a lot as a Canadian I agree so yeah yeah so I think it's kind of interesting because sometimes you know what we tend to find is that as people are polite right so I I once was working with someone who was kept on getting into Troublesome relationships oh you know like this relationship fell apart this relationship fell apart this relationship fell apart everyone out there is mean and toxic and then at some point like if you really want to be like authentic and compassionate and help someone with this problem you got to ask the question like maybe it's not everyone else maybe it's you and so I hopefully will become comfortable enough with each other we can feel safe enough with it with with each other that we can challenge each other authentically right and with compassion so we don't want to be mean but at the same time we always want to be compassionate we want to be kind but at the same time sometimes in order to grow we have to take a hard look at ourselves and sometimes we have blind spots and so that's why groups are really really important because as you all sort of have the shared experience we're all content creators you know hopefully that'll we'll sort of figure that out everyone kind of okay with that for now this will the rubber will hit the road later with this I guarantee you it'll get messy so a couple of other things so um I'm the group facilitator so this is kind of weird right so people sort of think about okay what does this mean if you're the group facilitator so I am up here and I am a facilitator so what that means is that I too am a content creator so I kind of know what it's like to be a content creator and I have an additional let's say training or expertise or things like that and I'll sort of be facilitating the group and so it's going to be really confusing for a while whether I'm supposed to take care of all y'all y'all are supposed to take care of all of each other are you all supposed to take care of me also yes yeah we'll see right like we'll see we'll see we'll see but it's it's okay to think about all right so another thing that I want to say is that you know even though I'm the sort of the peer facilitator of this group I'm not perfect and if anyone has concerns with anything that I say or do or I make a mistake you're welcome to bring it up directly on stream you're also welcome to you know contact our producer or other people if you don't want to bring it up on stream and create drama or whatever but generally speaking I think it's it's totally fine and one of the skills that we're going to be teaching in group is actually conflict resolution so hopefully at some point probably not the first couple weeks but later on like people will challenge each other there will be conflict if you you know y'all are welcome to criticize me or say hey I don't appreciate what you're doing or things like that make sense all right my Spiel is over um anyone have questions before we jump to introductions cool all right yeah okay I do why did you choose us that's a great question um so I've got a weird answer for you I didn't okay so I have no idea actually why y'all were chosen and I know it sounds kind of weird no clue so this is something that I try to do so for example like when we do group coaching like the coach doesn't choose the clients right even as a doctor I don't choose my patients and so I I don't know I'm sure you all are amazing uh I'm I think there was a very careful selection process but I am purposefully blind to it right so I actually know very little about something all I know just because I I like the work that you do but I'm going to pretend that I I don't you know don't but but actually I purposely try to come into this completely blind so that I have no preconceived notions about any drama that you all have been through or that you're a good person or bad person or you play a particular video game that I dislike because I play a competitor or whatever or for example that like you know just as an example like I've been protos for since day one in six pool rushing is for noobs right so for all that kind of stuff we want to be like I actually have no idea how does that sound is that weird ah it's not weird at all no yeah sounds great I actually plays there too random good to hear any other questions I commend you uh can I not go first on introductions because I'm absolutely do other people okay with uh metric seconds and not going first so yeah I want to commend two people already Ruby for actually asking a question because I don't know if you know this but like you know like most of the time if someone's like does anybody have questions no one ever asks a question you'll notice that so I commend you for actually taking the opportunity and you've actually opened the door I don't know if you'll get this but you've opened the door for other people to ask questions you got that Ruby so if we want to really dive in before we get into it which I can't help myself what do you all think metric seconds would have been more likely or less likely to share his concern about going first if Ruby had not asked a question we're gonna go on a whim and say less likely yeah right did you did you notice that uh metric seconds that like you sort of like since someone broke the ice it was easier for you to break the ice oh yeah right so that's really cool so like he was able to share a concern that he's got and we haven't asked you for your pronouns yet so apologies if I you know misgender anyone but and like no you got it but that's really awesome so I think participation in the group is going to make things easier for everyone so strong work for both y'all one person for asking a question and the second person for letting us know what their boundary is right so now we're going to learn how to respect that so let's do introductions do you all want me to go first or do you want me to go in the middle or do you want me to go last do you like to go together [Laughter] uh I assumed I would go first but out of politeness I gave people the choice okay thank you I will go first other people okay with that so what I was thinking in terms of introductions is tell us you know what you go by or what you want to be addressed to buy um please also this is a chance for you to tell us a little bit and all the viewers about your stream what kind of stream you do things like that and I personally would love to hear a little bit about how you got to be a content creator like why you became a content creator and also just to kind of kick things off uh one of the challenges or struggles that you face as a content creator so name if you want to specify your pronouns you're more than welcome to tell us you know where we can find you and learn more about you if we want to see how awesome you are at streaming and then tell us why you kind of got into content creation and the challenge that you struggle with is that cool okay so my name is alok um y'all can find me at healthygamer underscore GG uh so I'm I'm a twitch streamer but I'm also a psychiatrist by training and spent several years studying to become a monk um I got into streaming because as I was working with Gamers predominantly originally at the beginning I realized that most of the conversations I was having with them were like I was repeating myself so I'd work with 50 people and like with all 50 of those people I would explain the same stuff about stress about anxiety about you know identity things like that and I just got to wondering okay what would happen if I have a public conversation could people who were watching benefit and that's how I started content creation one of the challenges that I have as a content creator is everything besides the content creation so there's a lot of stuff that you have to do as a content creator which is not streaming I kid you all not this is the most excited I am about streaming in like the last three months because I love actually like talking to people working with people being with people and there's a bunch of stuff that goes on behind the scenes which is work that I find very draining oh y'all can call me all look or Dr K whichever one you feel more comfortable with by the way thank you who's next I'll go next cool all right uh hi I'm Michael uh I go by smirky you can just call me smirky for the sake of this uh he him his pronouns um let's see I have been streaming for uh I just celebrated uh 10 years of streaming um I started on YouTube in 2012 and then came over to Twitch around 2015 2016 and got partnered in 2018 I am a lgbtqi plus uh variety streamer I uh started out streaming a game called Toontown it used to be a Disney MMO from like way back in the day so there's probably some Nostalgia happening right now for quite a few people um the game is still around even though Disney shut it down like almost nine years ago uh there was like a community that's kept the community alive so it's really fun um I always love playing Toontown but uh recently I've been streaming all kinds of other games I tend to play games that are like multiplayer you know interactive um so even a game like Cult of the land that's like single player but like you get the twitch integration and it's like super interactive I love that stuff um I also do a bunch of Charity streaming as well so um we've raised over 65 000 for various Charities since I first started fundraising for charity um which is great thank you uh it's uh really great uh just helping out you know using my platform for like a cause much bigger than myself and I absolutely love uh to do that um I also just recently graduated college in December uh like last December um so I know a lot about like streaming while you're in school and things like that I'm trying to like how do you balance that um and then also um what am I missing I'm missing something else any challenges you face there's a stream or anything in particular right you find challenging yeah um yeah for me it's uh I guess lately it's been the shift from like streaming specifically just like one Soul game and Catering to that particular audience and now that I've like broadened my horizons as I continue to do that starting to do more variety like you know I guess uh kind of like both catering to that audience and also like um a new audience and then also like consistency has always been a struggle for me too um especially while I was in school like not really having much of a schedule so um that's that's something I'm kind of experimenting with right now um and uh yeah that's that's all I got I think awesome thank you so much smirky thank you thank you yes anyone feel like going next yeah before I forget hi um I have ADHD that's why I'm sat here the whole time going say the word um so hi my name is Ruby I've been streaming on Twitch for about seven years six years um I can feel my heartbeat hold on [Music] um I stream meditation um and wellness content um and that's kind of come around because of a my own anxiety and stuff so I do ASMR but I base it all around more meditation kind of content um I recently qualified this year as a sound therapist um I do sound baths and I'm currently training um to become like a meditation coach um to help other people so I started streaming playing games because I was lonely playing games and watching other people on Twitch and I thought hey I should try playing games with some other people on Twitch and see how that goes um and I found it made my anxiety worse um streaming and just like getting focused on numbers and who was watching me and growth and I got partnered while I was gaming and doing like body paint and creative kind of stuff um I just got so wrapped up in like numbers and everything and I was really depressed as well um and I was really struggling just to go live every single day and um I then trained as a yoga teacher because I wanted to quit streaming and I loved yoga I've been doing yoga about 10 years I wanted to do something um I thought I wanted to do something to help other people but I realized my yoga teacher training was actually a journey for myself and it helped me and um during that yoga teacher training I actually stayed in a Buddhist temple in London every weekend while streaming full-time during the week every weekend I would go and stay in the Buddhist temple for six months and I made really good friends with like the monks in there and the people that lived there and I loved getting up in the mornings and listening to their practices really early in the mornings of their gongs and everything they were doing every day and then I'd go to my yoga teacher training off in this other room and then I'd come back out and eat with them and spend my time with them and it was after that that I realized um I just wanted to kind of continue down that path so I've trained as a entire yogic massage I've I've I love doing different courses just to like meet people and um like you can always learn something you can always um even if you're teaching you can always be learning because like nobody is perfect and I still get anxiety like I think a lot of people assume that I'm absolutely fine because of the kind of content I do and I'm guiding other people um but I'm always working on my own practice um so now um my aims for streamer to be in service for others and to be continually learning and growing for myself awesome beautiful kind of curious has anyone else kind of struggled with focusing on metrics and getting depressed as a result anxious okay yeah been there done that what about people assuming you're fine when you're not and struggling to go live every day and awesome yeah that's part of the thing about being a content creator right yeah so that's that's part of that so we'll talk a little bit about that those are both bullets on our nine point curriculum so we'll we'll see when is the right time to dive in um anyone else want to introduce themselves or who wants to go next go for it sure I can go next um so my name's Josh otherwise known as Zell uh on the internet um I've been content creating for a good while so basically how I got into it was uh I graduated from college um and I so I I went to mechanical engineering uh hoping to get into the Aerospace industry and uh that year uh I was applying to Raytheon and they put me on a hiring freeze because Congress had cut a bunch of Aerospace funding that year so I was like okay I kind of have this like weird year where I kind of just like waiting doing nothing and so um I decided that I was going to make content because that was something that like I was always interested in like at the time I was playing a lot of League of Legends uh streaming like before you even twitch what existed it was back when like uh people were streaming on owned and Justin.tv and stuff like that and like um and I would watch some of my favorite league players stream back then and so I was like oh this is interesting and then also in that time I started applying to random places and I got like an offer to be a video producer for team curse at the time for their league team and so that's kind of my entry into it was that I gave up Engineering in my expensive college degree to go live my dreams or something [Laughter] though that's what got me into it I started streaming league and then I I think most people probably know me from my time in offline TV or um or uh I used to host a show uh for Riot games called um all chat uh so that's probably where people have mostly heard of me and now I stream just like a bunch of nonsense um and that's who I am as far as struggles um God what don't I struggle with uh I struggle I think the big one is kind of related to how people know me from uh which is offline TV and Riot games like I feel like uh in a lot of ways like kova hit me pretty hard like during covet I kind of stopped content creating I kind of lost my drive to do so and then so now it kind of feels like I'm starting over and I don't have the same momentum that I felt like I had in years past and so there's this constant feeling of like how do I live up to my own standards that I used to have for myself before and like kind of building off what ruby was saying about metrics and stuff like that is this always hanging in the back of my mind that like you know people have heard of me but people don't care about me anymore and so like how do I live up to other people's expectations how do I live up to my own expectations and I I think like that has been a big primary struggle for me as a recent so um yeah thanks for sharing Zell I can go next um so I'm metric seconds uh everyone calls me metric uh he him totally fine uh I've been streaming almost six years one of your mods just yelled at me to get out of chat I'm so sorry uh and uh so I originally got into streaming because um I had a really fun stomach illness that stopped me from uh going out and being social with my friends and I was looking for ways to actually be social and uh eventually I you know moved on from YouTube let's plays that I used to watch all the time to realizing oh there's twitch and uh realizing that I could just talk to a bunch of people that like the same thing I did and uh then I kind of thought you know it'd be cool if more people who looked like me were streaming because I noticed that it's not very common um it it and and also it looks fun so I saved up for a computer and built it myself and started streaming and yeah six years in um I kind of made my name on uh deathless runs in darkest dungeon I put uh 3 300 hours plus into that game so far um sequel's okay so far it's not complete but uh I beat myself mercilessly in that game while that game also beat me uh just to beat it without dying and when I finally did it on the hardest setting I had no idea what to do with myself I I got partnered in that time but after that I I didn't know what to do um and uh the goals after that just seemed like I play every other game now in variety on the hardest setting just because I don't know if I feel like I should or just because I can or I just like suffering or I don't know but that's that's what I do um and uh I don't care how many times I die or I fail or my soul gets crushed um I think even how I present myself right now with the knives kind of speaks to that it's like I'm very that's my personality of I have to fight something um so now I'm like practicing to like no hit cuphead or you know beat rimworld on the hardest setting or uh I hate myself I'm sorry that's that's me but yeah um I love I love doing it like the sense of accomplishment when you get it that's that's the fun part um but after after all that time those years in darkest dungeon it's sort of like looking at the the numbers and the viewership and everything just drop off uh I I just sort of Wonder like did I did I deserve all that success that I had back then and where am I now um and to there's a variety a thing that I really should be doing um or should I just do the thing where I do one game over and over and then uh not be happy just doing that but everyone else shows up for that and is that really any different from a nine to five job where you do the same thing over and over again that you don't necessarily love and I I don't know I don't know so I I have days where I feel like an abject failure and then other days where something goes right in in um on top of the world so yeah okay thank you so much for sharing thank you is there a girl do you feel comfortable introducing yourself oh gosh I'm last hey everyone my name is Kathy AKA sir girl I've been streaming on and off um on Twitch for like the past 10 years or so and it's just been everyone's like talking about all the variety games they've done obviously for me it's just been non-stop Starcraft 95 of the time uh I'm mostly just stream Starcraft ladder of you know playing Team games with friends or getting coached by other people and my streams consist of me kind of going over gameplay or just like what's going through my thoughts at the time so that's the majority of the content that I create and um streaming was something that I picked up when I was in college at the time that was just in TV around uh that long time ago and uh people were just telling me like hey Kathy you play this game um it's getting popular on Twitch and just in TV you should you should try sharing it with folks and then once I started streaming a lot of people were interested in the game and like talking about it so just kind of picked up from there and then I realized I can make some money off of it as well as opening lots of doors of opportunities um I would say like my streaming experience was very helpful into uh where I am today uh right now I work at Activision Blizzard King so the company that actually made the game my background also consists of working at Minecraft as well and a bunch of other service drops like waitressing and whatnot so and one of the challenges I have these days is kind of balancing that corporate job and streaming and trying to maximize my happiness from both but yeah nice to meet everyone awesome welcome so thank you all so much for such substantive introductions um let me just explain a couple of things so the first thing is that every day or for first couple days we're gonna actually teach y'all particular communication skills so it's been our experience that if you want to run a group effectively part of what you actually have to learn how to do is like there are certain skills that we're going to use to help each other learn about ourselves and to like bring sort of information out okay um the other thing that I want you all to notice is that people's introductions were of varying length right and that's actually perfectly okay so on any given day someone we may focus on one particular person or one particular issue more than other people and that's like that's totally fine and over time though over the course of eight weeks what we sort of want to make sure that we do is we sort of give everyone their fair share or try to help everyone in a substantial way so here's kind of an interesting question who's responsible for making sure that we have balanced participation all of us right so that means to be a little bit careful about you know just being mindful of who's participating who isn't and this is where things get kind of tricky right because if someone's not really talking what do we do about that ask them to participate participate more sell foreign [Laughter] yeah so I want you all to think a little bit about when do you feel the most comfortable participating right and and oftentimes it's a question so if you all notice that someone's like not participating in the discussion y'all can absolutely Loop them in okay make sense any questions so I'm going to just toss a couple of topics out um and let me know actually let me start with this so did y'all kind of notice any themes between what people were sort of sharing like anything kind of jump out to you where someone was saying something and you're like oh that's relevant to me too like I'm that's an issue I struggle with or I want to learn more about that anything kind of jump out to y'all when you were listening to other people uh yeah when um when smirky talked about switching to variety okay and and the pain of it it's it's yeah um I feel you I've had my fair share of going to panels and like learning as much as I can about variety streaming so okay and um for me uh the uh uh it was uh Zerg with the balance between corporate and uh and content creation because like I've been because now that I'm graduated I've been bound I've been toying around with the question like well do I actually finally get the chance to like be more consistent with streaming or should I like you know try and get a job to get on my feet but then how can I you know be a little more consistent with streaming uh so I don't know it's a topic that's been floating around in my mind too in terms of my future but yeah do both popped out do both I like I when I heard that it reminded me like when I was working at Riot but also streaming and I was figuring that out and so I came up with something that I tried and didn't exactly go super well so I could share that at some point too all right cool and I mean it's kind of like man I just went through all these years of school like literally ever since I started streaming like it's been streaming in school but school's always like first right and then it's like oh well now I could like dive into the corporate world I'm I feel confident in myself but also like it's kind of something I want to do a little more so you know it's like hey Society won't expect you to like get a job and do that but it's like hey streaming is kind of something I like to do too so do I run and chase with the passion or do I dabble in both a little bit do I dabble in streaming and see how it goes I that's definitely been on my mind I think the answer I'm curious if people sort of resonate this was as someone said it earlier do more do more both do it all who's felt that way yeah yeah right so we can maybe dig into where that comes from how we handle it what we do about it anyone else kind of want to chime in with stuff that may have resonated with them yeah so when metric said do you just play the same game and then it turns into like feeling the same as a nine to five I'm sitting there thinking I'm not a gaming streamer but I know that and I think that goes with like whatever content you're making when you know what brings the numbers it's that Breakaway from um knowing what brings numbers and what brings happiness um and I try not to look at my view account and it's very hard like I don't have it on while I'm streaming and in the kind of work that I do I continually tell myself if I just made a few people's day better than my job was kind of done but also at the same time it's my job and I want to be like it's very I find it very hard in what I do I'm so grateful for what like position I'm in in life that I can do this and help other people and I like my emphasis was always on helping other people and then I can get myself so busy that I forget about if I'm actually helping me and I think that happens not just in in gaming like when you're playing the same game that's not good for your mind like monotonously doing the same thing over and over just for the numbers so yeah I was I wanted to let people know that that's like a not just a gaming stream I think I'm curious does anyone else find themselves is Ruby put it continually telling yourself something does that resonate with anyone else for sure yeah yeah for a girl what you're I see you're nodding a little bit what do you find yourself continually telling yourself uh that I'll get better at my game I'll practice I need to up that MMR and I lose for several hours straight and I'm like okay why am I here is it's like a vicious cycle sometimes yeah right it's kind of interesting so I've got kind of a quick question for you all and we'll give other people a chance to sort of uh share anything that resonated with them so when we do we continually tell ourselves things that we believe I'm gonna we can affirmations here and affirming yeah basically yeah if you continually affirm something to yourself you will start to believe it and it will become your truth Okay so so but that suggests that the continually telling part comes prior to the believing part right so that's kind of interesting it does because the continually telling us therefore sort of suggests that we don't actually believe it on some level which is why we continually tell ourselves right because we want to believe it we want it to be true so we'll dig into stuff like that potentially as well anyone else want to just share anything that um kind of resonated with them that someone else said if if something else pops up let me know so I have a list of like a ton of stuff these are all the discussion topics eight or nine of these are things that we've sort of prepped for um I think there's a lot to discuss here so I'd like to actually start by sort of teaching a skill for the day and the skill that we're going to be learning is digging into ambiguity so sometimes if you pay attention people are going to be making statements that are a little bit ambiguous so I'm going to highlight and digging into ambiguity is an opportunity to expand into what someone is saying so I'm going to highlight two things that I've heard I mean all of y'all have done this but I'm going to sort of highlight two things that jumped out to me so uh metric said at some point I noticed when when I was streaming that other people didn't look like me and so I find myself being curious like what does he mean by that what is he how does he perceive himself what did he see as other people so that's like a good example of like you know if we sort of inquire about that like we can learn a little bit more about what he was perceiving maybe he feels like a little bit of an outsider you know like we can kind of get into stuff like that Zell also zelkan opened the door for us a little bit more and he's like I was trying to figure out work a work-life balance and I tried something and I can share that later if people want so that is Zell being polite right do you all see the politeness there I do Somebody explain the politeness absolutely yeah yeah that you know being mindful of the I guess like the setting that we're in all the people watching let's be mindful of everyone else by the way I'm a little bit on the sarcastic side and exaggerated side zella's already pointed this out right he's like if I want to bully people I can say what you said but so so that's just my Mo and if that you know rubs on anyone the wrong way please let me know I can absolutely tone it down a notch I am after all content creator so um so let's just think a little bit about this politeness so like who here when Zell said that like did we ask him about it is that because we haven't had time what are the reasons that we may not ask about it right so sometimes we've got to be a little bit careful because zella's being polite but I'll give you all kind of an example so yeah how's everybody's week going oh my week is like my week sucks I went through a terrible breakup and then in that moment I don't want to like bog down the group with my story and then are y'all gonna ask me about the breakup they want to talk about it how do we know if they want to if they want to understand beautiful do you want to talk about it so I can see Ruby's experience as a Healer in other parts of life really shining through here right so so one of the challenges that we sometimes face is that like we want to also respect the person's boundaries right what it's like does a person want to talk about their breakup do they not want to talk about their breakup so this is where we're just gonna have to figure out where our balances is a group in terms of digging into ambiguity because the thing is Zeal is polite right like zella's like I don't want to monopolize the time and at the same time digging into that kind of stuff maybe he's got a strategy maybe we can together piece together different kinds of strategy because work life balance or balancing different things seems very important to people in the group right so it sounds like it's an important discussion so what I'd like to I'd love to do is for you all to be able to dig into ambiguity and as Ruby sort of mentioned we can just ask about it so does anyone have an idea if I wanted to dig into the ambiguity of metric sort of in the appearance issue what could how could I do that practically I mean you have to you who's hell you go oh I mean yeah it's all you go okay uh I was thinking you would ask them to expand on exactly what they meant yeah so you want to give that a shot okay instead of okay let's do it go for it as hell so yeah in this example then metric I would ask you you know what asked to ask you know you told okay I am in the moment okay so I'm asking you uh uh when you said that people who stream didn't look like you what did what exactly did you mean like physically or like you know could you maybe physically it's just that I I in from like I joined Twitch in I think 2016 um and I spent a lot of time checking out tons of streams and I didn't see a lot of brown people um I don't still to this day I don't when I find one it's like finding your Unicorn it's like finding a happy delivery person delivery people not happy you ever find one they're just not happy you find one you hold on to that but um Dr K like this is the first time I've ever shared a a screen with another brown person it's like my mom when I talked to her about this stream she's like no one's going to be racist to you are they I'm like well I mean the host is brown so I think probably not you know it's his channel and I I'm gonna use him as a shield he'll protect me but um I I to this day I don't see a lot of uh Brown streamers um I see even less brown Partners I know of like maybe a handful uh and it makes me sad um and it's not just to say that like oh um you know I'm Brown you should watch me that's definitely not it it's you know putting something forward that people want to watch uh I just wonder if I would be more successful if I didn't have a face cam I think about that all the time um that if people didn't know so you know that's that's what I mean so awesome thank you for sharing that like yeah how do people feel right now sad yeah it's never it's never like uh enlightening when like the scale of rep of like diversity and representation is not as great as it could or should be and it also uh I guess reaffirms the um the drive for me to uplift you know other voices not just you know people that are like me but also the other people around me too yeah the the part about your mum you know she's always having to think about protecting you in that way yeah you know and um and it just yeah it's I appreciate you sharing so that I can listen and just understand from your point of view and yeah just help in any way that I can how do you feel metric um I've felt good sharing that terrified to even say it in front of so many people because it feels like you know oh he's bringing up race uh because I'm I don't like talking about it you you tend to get shouted down a lot when you say anything about it even if it's your lived experience so yeah and so let's just circle back to a couple things then we'll talk more about this but good job Zell right so I don't know if you all remember but Zell asked like a really nice question and look at what's happened right so like metric walks around every single day with this thought like I'm an outsider right and and that's something that I noticed too I made another observation I hope this is okay please let me know if this makes anyone else uncomfortable but I noticed that brown people are underrepresented in the streaming community and also in pornography you know it's kind of like a weird observation but I just like notice that I'm not trying to hopefully that makes it was just like because we don't talk about that kind of stuff and I'm kind of curious as anyone else feel like an outsider in the streaming community yeah I mean it's it's weird because I think like I think when it comes to like the biggest streamers right like I think the vast majority of them are white or Asian so like as another you know East Asian descent person like it feels weird a bit to kind of like conflate my issues on this one but I think like um I mean I think just in general in representation overall right like especially for like just speaking on my own experience as an Asian dude like growing up I I grew up in the Midwest and so uh and I'm old so like back then it was like there are no Asian actors except Jackie Chan and then when Ken John came into the scene which uh which like act are you oh you're Ken Jong it was like you know there were there was no there was nothing that people could relate you to because representation just literally didn't exist right and like the amount of times that I've been told that I am just the you know biggest like you know the Jackie Chan's the Bruce Lee's the you know like the the symbols of age and like I think it wasn't until even even more recently in terms of like beauty standards too for Asian dudes like you know how is it how frequently do you ever see an Asian male Asian actor ever kiss somebody on screen uh in movies or whatever right so like um so I think that I totally empathize with you there that like there is the sense of like well yeah no one has any sort of understanding of who I am and what like I could even be related to because you've never even seen it you know like uh so like I yeah I guess I understand Western beauty standards made me feel like constantly ugly and the other thing is people come to my stream and say like did you know you look like calpen or that guy from Big Bang Theory or you know it's like dude I don't look like any of those people I I don't like I I am coincidentally Brown at the same time as they are it that's it and and then to be to be told that I look like another actor or something who is brown but does not look like me at all like nothing like me um it's like I'm sorry you only know of one famous brown person that's that's good for you and the the other thing that that I always found funny about Brown representation in say Hollywood or whatever is that they're always like the joke character um like the the goofy like sidekick character that you're not supposed to take seriously and as probably also like what's the word sexually non-threatening like you don't see them ever like being the you know main romance point or anything like that so yeah I also want to I'm curious if other people resonated with this when Zell said so like kind of you know appreciating and I really commend zel for sort of sharing this that here's metric talking about being Brown when in streaming there's a bunch of Caucasian people East Asian people and he's like wait I'm an East Asian person too but I feel like an outsider and so I'm curious does anyone else sort of resonate with this idea that I feel a particular way but I'm not allowed to like did you all get that from Zell a little bit that he's like I'm not really allowed to complain because I'm East Asian right I I was sort of picking that up I'm curious if anyone else sort of felt that so does that resonate with you like yeah I mean I definitely you know like was kind of uh I don't know what the proper word here is like uh implying that yes right so I'm curious do other people feel like there's a struggle that they have which they're not allowed to have yeah I mean I'm seeing stuff in chat like first world problems and why are we demonizing the west and stuff and it's like you're not you're not allowed to criticize it like it exists it's not perfect but you can everyone's got problems with it you can be as white as white can be you can still have problems with it like no so I'm curious so somebody else said yeah too right but mine just feels like so trivial compared to no that's why uh yeah I'm calling you out so I'm being honest with you Dr K originally asked if you feel out of place in the streaming like on Twitch and stuff so I have had a lot of pressure when I started doing the content that I do now to not do the content I do now to I had pressure to do more gaming um because I could get more sponsors I can you can get into parties you can get more sponsorships you can get free stuff from like companies like oh why don't you do like a couple of gaming streams a week because then you can be involved in all this twitch stuff because I'm not traditionally twitch you know I'm not what people think of with twitch you don't and I'm not traditionally what people expect in the ASMR category either I'm on my own and it's it's taken me a long time and actually I've had coaching with one of Dr K's coaches for um about a year I did um I think I was one of your first um people and uh it took it took a long time and and it was still after I finished my coaching that I was like okay this is my superpower not being like anyone else and sticking to what I I want to do but then every now and then there'll be something like twitchcon um which I was made an ambassador this year um which kind of like affirmed that stick to the thing that is you kind of thing it kind of like affirmed all of that to me um but still going to twitchcon nothing felt like it was for me and um you know nothing not that I want the event to be revolved around me like I'm just one person there's loads of people there that do gaming but it it can make you feel very outsidery you know um and as someone who's neurodivergent as well I suddenly realize why I hate parties um I enjoy fun I enjoy gatherings I enjoy friends I enjoy people I just really struggle with events and socializing and and um and just lots of noise and people and um which makes sense as to I only got diagnosed last year so it makes sense as to why I've ended up where I am kind of in life um so yeah that's how I kind of feel outside of Twitch in general is it okay if I ask Ruby a question um so in in your category of streaming um do you feel like you um you feel like an outsider because you might be written off as like some people write off women who do what you do as like being an e-girl or something like that do you have to fight off that kind of thing I have a lot of trouble with this [Music] um not because I'm against anyone else doing what they want to do and what they are doing it's the assumptions that everyone is the same which people shouldn't be doing to anyone in that category full stop each Creator is their own Creator they shouldn't be assuming that anyone's doing anything um and then I get a lot of I get treated that I'm like I'm acting like I'm not like the other girls um by other people in my chat so you know the whole I'm not like the other girls kind of thing um people come and be like it's so good to finally find someone not showing cleavage and licking a microphone oh and like they instantly get timed out by my mods so I don't allow like we're not going to talk about other people in my chat you either come in and you join in with my content we're not there to bash anyone we're not there to bring anyone down that's like against everything that I do um and so they'll get a little time out and my mods will say well you're here now and enjoy this we don't need to bring anyone else down and we're not having that discussion but people will try and poke that discussion out of me um about ASMR and what ASMR is and at the end of the day my answer is everything will be made sexual and everything in life can be made sexual like from Car Sales they can make that sexy like to football you know they used to have women painted up on the the pitch in England and stuff and like if something's not sexy it can be made sexy everything can be sexual like it's ASMR and like that kind of stuff is like music to me you can't just listen to One genre of music one song and be like oh I hate music every ASMR Creator is different and everyone's doing it their own way they're making sounds they're creating content in their own way but yeah as an ASMR like I stream in the ASMR category doing meditation and stuff because I don't know where else to go and it brings in the most viewers because most people are looking to relax a lot of people are in that category because they do have anxiety because they're looking for um yeah they're just looking for that kind of content so yeah sorry if I went on a bit long be sorry it's very insightful so yeah that's that's I feel so metric how did it feel to ask a question I mean she went in depth and I found it exactly what I wanted to know so um I'm glad I asked it cool so so um I don't know if you all realize this but we've been doing this for about 70 minutes does it bias yeah interesting right how do y'all understand that I mean I mean TBH like if I'm going to be completely honest like going into this without a lot of info and not knowing everybody I think a lot of it is just tied to Pure nervousness and like I you know I'm I'm sitting here listening my best but also at the same time my heart and my brain are going like what are what is what is the expectation here what is the expectation among the other people what do they want to hear what do they expect me to say what does Dr K want to say what do you think his chat will think of us like you know like I'm I'm in the moment but I also I'm also like racing on the racetrack right now at the same time so the time flying by makes sense to me because my brain's like going nuts here right so uh you know anytime there's like a a split silence I'm like like what's the expectation is that is that should I be feeling that should I speak up like uh you know like hey uh Zirk girl I notice you're a little on the quiet side like should I should I try to get you in somehow like should I try but is it weird if I'm the facilitator Now isn't that Dr K's job is it weird if I step up to do you know like I've been reading that's like what Marine brain does I literally finished speaking and went in my head did I say the right thing is that what I was meant to say sounds like we got a lot of overthinkers in this group yeah oh really no never never no twitch streamers would never overthink anything never and I think like it gets worse here because we have six people in the call so only one person can get their words out so the rest of us are busy digging in their brains so you know like I feel it yeah anyone else so so Zell thank you for sharing um let me think about whether this is a time that I should step in or step back um I mean I think we all want to pull their girl in is this I think I believe we would all like to we just don't know how so how how does it feel to hear that sir girl I'm down I'm Dodge talk I was just kind of sitting here taking in what everyone's saying um I guess in terms of feeling ostracized or kind of lonely or set apart uh even as a competitive gamer I feel like I'm alone sometimes but I think it's a little bit unique because uh Starcraft used to be super popular back then nowadays when I go to events um yeah there's other Gamers and streamers there but they don't they've heard of Starcraft they haven't really played it so it's kind of hard to connect with people uh you know sometimes I'm like oh yeah let's follow each other's channels let's like play games together it's really [ __ ] hard to teach Starcraft to someone like sometimes they come into my channel they don't know what the game's about and they're like I'm dizzy what's going on like and then I'm just like or I miss like something that they were saying so it kind of adds I can understand the loneliness part of it because it's like oh I it'd be awesome if I could meet other people who stream under my category and sometimes I'm like maybe I should try out League of Legends or valorin or fortnite and then I just go back to Starcraft so yeah I kind of understand the loneliness aspect of that yeah me too except just from an unsaturated directory that is Toontown where sometimes no one is streaming sometimes 20 people are streaming uh you know when I want to like uh you know uh get involved with more things it's like I'm not doing the same thing that everyone else is doing so there are only so many things I could possibly like you know throw my hat in the rain for uh so I I can emphasize with that from that perspective yeah I do I have some friends who are Die Hard 210 online fans and I have to send them their way please do we we were streaming to in Town Front Page yesterday so very much still on the uh on the list of on my repertoire of being dead sorry girl I'm curious what was behind the question do you have a sense uh because Toontown is a very old game older than Starcraft so I was like oh I wanted to get this idea because even if if Starcraft is older we still kind of have a community we have tournaments going on offline online so yeah I just wanted to kind of compare like the level right yeah it's very yeah it's very like small but also tight-knit like there's you know I always see like a good amount of people repeatedly within the little Toontown community that we have um and uh it's nice to always see those people again for sure I'm curious for um metric Zell and Ruby I I'm wondering if y'all are feeling like this is the beginning of a conversation there's something about Starcraft and Toontown do y'all are y'all kind of feeling that like what what do you what do you think could be going on in is there a girl's head like why is she inquiring about Toontown like where could this conversation go networking no um uh I don't know I mean they feel they feel kind of similar like what feels similar What feelings they're both having good like about about their situations and what about the game they play and what are the feelings that y'all are noticing what what's the Resonance of the wavelength here the sense of isolation yeah yeah in the content that you create um and yeah like it's like smaller communities or at least trying to like Foster and maintain those communities um yeah yeah I I think this is probably just you know there's a lot of empathy here in the similar sort of situation with the games with like I mean as somebody who loves uh Super Smash Brothers Melee it's it's like a super Niche game from you know 20 years ago it's old enough to drive if it was a person but like you know just this idea that you could be doing something that's more worthwhile like something that's flavor of the month and like there's always that tension of like do I do this thing that is Niche uh but is like a big part of who I am or do I go after something that I know does really well and then on top of that it's also that like we're people we're multifaceted it's not like you know maybe you have streamed StarCraft all your life you've streamed Toontown all your life you know whatever but that's not all you are right it's not like that's the only thing you've been interested in and so like also collating that with you know your other interests like it's tough as a streamer to have to make that decision and I think that's the kind of empathizing point that I feel like we're uh we're starting to hear a little bit what do y'all think uh is there a girl and and smirky is is Zell metric or Ruby are they on on on the pulse of it they I think so absolutely yeah so I'm I'm gonna make a slightly metric you wanted to say something no it's agreeing yeah yeah so like look at that right so the first thing I want to point out is like how cool is that that with just one question and a little bit of back and forth we can see so much of what these people are feeling and so now I'm going to make a hyperbolic statement which is supposed to be kind of almost emotionally engaging what do I do if I'm a streamer and my Niche is a game that's dying that's something I had to that question was running in my head when Disney was sunny downtown uh we had like a month's notice and that entire month I was like it's like two times your entire brand now what do you do what do you like how are you supposed to like you know because it's like you worry about your audience you worry about like the community itself like what's going to happen uh it those were definitely tumultuous times but it kind of happened to me too when when dark is dungeon 2 was released in Early Access because the hype for that was huge but at the same time that game is practically dead on on Twitch half the time because it's waiting for Content updates and it's hard to play it right now when it's only half done um and to that end it actually killed a lot of the hype around the first game so it's like you can't do any of it really and be as successful as you were before so now I gotta go looking for other things I don't want them to be exactly super similar because I already did the same thing for 3 000 Plus hours so absolutely yeah right so I just want to call attention to the amount of time we've got we've got about 10 minutes left um with the group's permission I'd like to take an opportunity to try to summarize today and also maybe do a little bit of teaching is that okay so normally I think I may teach a little bit more I may ask for a little bit more time towards the end but y'all were doing just such an awesome job of like opening things up inquiring resonating with each other that I you know I just like gotta let it gotta let it keep going everyone was vibing I think it was good so the first thing is that I want to thank everyone for being here today um I I want to also acknowledge the awkwardness of it right so part of the group experience I know it's tough but like part of the group experience is kind of sink or swim and this is the kind of thing where like I was also tracking participation and you know I'm paying attention to who's talking who's not talking and I really appreciate that y'all lifted that with me so we were all noticing right so like and this is where like Zerg girl was a little bit quieter but she's also like giving other people space right because people have stuff to say and so like we want to give people space when they have something to share and like in the process of giving people space and because silence is awkward so if we want Zara girl and Ruby to participate more we've got to figure out what's our like silence threshold here because us people that like can't handle it like you know we're gonna dominate the conversation unless we can learn to handle it and also what would our lives be like if we could tolerate silence you know like what would that be like if you could just be patient so I think a lot of today is just about this is the tutorial basically right we're like not really sure how to play this game I also want to acknowledge what Zell was saying that y'all are you know content creators so it's very hard for us to be fully present because we're thinking about you know what does twitch chat think like are we doing it right are we doing it wrong like and that's where like y'all are doing it right but doing it right actually means not knowing how to do it and this is act I would probably sorry I would say that silence is terrifying as far as being a content creator because dead air typically in in most streamers lives is no like you want to run away from that not not not always not you're right not like it's like you press you press go live and you're waiting for someone to pop up in chat just like hey how you doing and then and then you just you got somebody to talk to at least right so but what when if it's just this group not being streamed I think silence isn't as scary for me but knowing that like so many people are watching and nobody's talking that's that's like multiplied tenfold then like if I was just streaming by myself yeah so See You in My Stream if my chat's gone quiet I just assumed they're all chilling like I have people come in that are new they're like yo hey and they're like why are you so quiet there's 400 people here why chat dead and the mother be like middle of a sound bath we're meditating and then they'll put some little like emotes in a few people pop up and be like and then it'd be quiet again and but it took that yeah it took me a while to learn that that's okay so I'm noticing that metric has been conditioned right this is conditioning yeah I have to engage at all so this is one of the challenges of being a streamer is streaming conditions you to behave a certain way and then part of the challenge of being a streamer we'll get to this is that then then that conditioning spills over into other parts of your life because the way that streaming shapes your brain you carry that brain with you everywhere you go into your interpersonal relationships into your romantic relationships into you know being on for your friends and now you're a streamer and that's how people identify you and what kind of judgment does that come with Etc so there's a bunch of stuff that gets Tangled in so my hope is that we can explore this kind of Silence thing I think we're going to have to figure it out as a group we're not saying that metric has to become fully comfortable with it but he's got to be able to tolerate it to give people space to you know step in so we're gonna we're gonna focus on that a little bit but I think today was the tutorial y'all all did an awesome job it's gonna be awkward it's gonna continue to be awkward but that's actually the point because I want you all to appreciate for a second or think about we Retreat from awkwardness and when we Retreat from awkwardness we actually like it impairs our growth a little bit right if we think a little bit about our comfort zone and like extending our comfort zone out into becoming comfortable with more things there's that barrier of comfort between comfort and uncomfortable where like it's kind of awkward so we're gonna like figure this out because this is a weird situ people don't talk like this you don't meet someone for an hour and people are like yeah like you know I feel racially isolated I feel like you know the game that I'm in is dying and now I don't know if I should variety stream and then like but there's a lot of common themes here right because and Ruby's like okay I'm gonna do ASMR and that's my Niche and that's like my journey and like it went really well and and now I'm an ambassador for twitchcon and that now it's like you know I'm wondering if if smirk is kind of thinking well if I keep on sweeping streaming Toontown will I be an ambassador for twitchcon one day like who knows right what's the right answer and so what I'm going to kind of leave you all with because I don't have too much time for a summary which is totally fine is I think next week what I am going to suggest we talk about but if we go off track that's totally fine the one theme that I heard today that I thought was kind of dominant I mean there's a lot actually that were dominant but like is this idea of metrics and numbers and making the content that you want to or selling out do I change games do I become a niche do I start becoming a variety streamer what do I do when my game isn't working do I lean into like do I become a content creator am I an artiste who isn't going to you know give in to the changes and if I switch over to law no offense to all you know or valorant or Apex or whatever people are playing GTA role play you know do I need to do that like like and what does it mean to be a streamer do I chase the numbers how much do I chase the numbers you know so here's what my experience has been as both a content creator and having worked with other content creators so this is like where the teaching comes in so it's our belief at healthy gamer we may be wrong here and let's be fair we're not the most successful in terms of content creation right so we're not like the biggest content creators on the planet but it's my belief that the best content comes out of like an authentic desire to make something when you're like your authentic creative self and when you kind of take that authenticity and then play the metrics game that's when you become the most successful so it's not sacrificing yourself and selling out for the sake of metrics but it's also like we got to be honest here as being content creators we can't just show up and make art and ignore all the numbers ignore all the trends and things like that it's all about and I think you all have also brought this up a lot about balance right so how do you access those parts of yourself that are you know authentic and and this is where you know I'm kind of thinking about Starcraft because I love Starcraft Starcraft is the reason that I almost failed out of college I love the game so I played it a ton and there's a part of me that's so grateful that Zerg girl still plays Starcraft because like I love RTS like where is RTS in the gaming world now it's an amazing genre but then like how do you microtransact RTS like we don't know how to do that so people don't make RTS games anymore you can't make RTS pay to win no one would play and if it weren't for people like Zara girl or I mean I'm not particularly familiar with Toontown or whatever but like you know how do you how like how do you keep this like circles keeping it alive you know so how do you balance these things how do you balance who you are as a Creator what you want to build in life with the metrics with the job you know with the like okay what do I do like how do you figure out what this balance is how do you invent yourself or reinvent yourself or stay true to who you are because here's the one thing that I'll say about content creation what makes content creation different from all these other forms of entertainment is the authenticity when you watch a movie it's crafted it's edited there's makeup there's this there's this it's like processed when you watch TV it's processed we even have reality TV which pretends to be authentic right but I don't know if you all have heard of like you know people who've been on reality TV shows and how actually like artificially inflated it is yeah but what y'all are is authentic y'all don't have the production budget to be fake right I mean literally my roommates are like standing behind my setup trying to get me to laugh just a moment right like I I can't I can't try to I can't fake that and so the reason that that content creation of this kind is growing is because I think there's an appetite out there for like authenticity and when I think about you know you guys you all think about y'all y'all's community and I think the P the reason that you all have the community that you have is because of your authenticity it's because you know you got to play the game of Trends a little bit so next week what I'd love to do is is kind of dive into that because I think that's a lot of the essence of being a content creator is the struggle between you know what do I what kind of content do I make and and talking a little bit about balance how does that feel as a topic sounds great yeah cool um I had something else but I forgot yeah I'm blanket oh yeah and just that's how you know it's not scripted so so Dell was saying like am I supposed to talk am I not supposed to talk honestly just to share this with you all I wasn't sure either because it's like you know honestly y'all kind of threw me off because y'all did outperformed what I was expecting in terms of authenticity picking things up like I usually I have to like I'm pulling the wagon but y'all were just like pushing it from behind so it's actually like kind of easy like I didn't have to mention participation people noticed it on their own y'all didn't let each other get away with it you know like Ruby like like I said at the very beginning I'm like does anyone have questions first time I can think of where someone's actually asked a question and so it's it's that energy that y'all are bringing to the table and when Zell is talking about the parallel thought process by the way I don't know what else to call it this is something we're going to talk about as well right was is a content creator it's actually hard to be present because you've got the metrics running above you're there creating content but you're always kind of wondering and then we even figure out some tricks like Ruby does which is like I'm going to turn off the viewer account because I want to be present and so now it's like you're struggling because the most present the most authentic is when you make the best content but you also want to know what gets viewers to stay and what gets viewers to leave because that's how you grow and how do we balance growth and authenticity how do we balance making the content that we want to and if you're a partner and like you know getting paid because like it's hard to have a job and create content so sometimes I'll assign homework nothing's really popping for me right now do people want homework validate me I just yeah that's how do people feel other people I'll take optional homework okay if my modes are watching can you please write homework down so so it's not it's not gonna be like you know write an essay about moral themes in Dostoevsky so so I just want you all to think a little bit about so let's pick one of two things so we're going to focus on balance but we're gonna I'm gonna give you all a choice okay the first is balancing like work stuff with life stuff and the second sorry streaming stuff with like non-streaming stuff so that could be work it could be life it could be personal relationships and this is the direction that the group wants to go in versus balancing like authenticity versus metrics and like creating content for the sake of like passion and love versus like this whole like well at this point it's become a nine to five and the whole reason I became a streamer is because I didn't want a job where I have to wake up every day and do the same damn thing so what resonates with y'all more [Music] uh I like the second one more because gaming is mostly my life so I've forgotten by the time you finish I was that's why I was laughing I was like okay GG the first one was so like basically streaming non-streaming balance and the second was like authenticity versus metrics the second one yeah the second one we I mean and we can we can always touch on both these topics if we really want to throughout oh yeah we'll get to both things right so I mean yeah so I'm totally down to do the authenticity side of it because I always I always say like I preach authenticity like we're an authentic Community but like it's also gonna like talk about it with others and really pinpoint what that means okay so Zales are girl you all have opinions uh I'm gonna go against the mold and the first one I resonate with more but that said they both have things that I you know relate to so I'm also down and if we're gonna get to both then I'd you know defer to the group on which we hit first it's our girl huh okay so I'll start well this is this is the homework okay it's gonna be simple so you guys could write an essay if you want to you can think about it in the shower if you want to you can do whatever you want but what's the cost of authenticity and what's the cost of playing the metrics does that feel okay in terms of homework we'll start yeah awesome so just before we wrap up uh I'd love to just get feedback from y'all if you guys want to share kind of initial Impressions questions whatever give you all sort of a a chance like no no more substantive discussion okay but just like admit like you know how did y'all feel this went or if you guys have any questions or anything like that and lastly if you all want to take a moment to tell everyone who's watching where they can find you once again uh quick question uh is because we have another participant who couldn't make it to this so are they going to introduce themselves at the start of the next session what do y'all think only there I would think so yeah right yeah yeah I I I would think so I just I I just wanted to make sure good for you for looking out for the other people yeah I wasn't my plan that if you missed session one you never get to introduce yourself and we have to just guess what your name is it's just this Randomness it shows up with it was on my mind okay good question no it shows that you're looking out for members in the group even if they're not there he's a good egg I'm gonna be honest like feedback wise I like can't even wrap my head around it because like you know we talked about kind of our goals here but it also feels like the discussions don't necessarily have a specific goal we're kind of like developing it as we go and so my brain because I'm very like I like having my objectives in front of me it's very hard for me to think of like proper feedback over you know over this thing that doesn't have like a specific directive behind it and so I'm like is it going well I hope it's going well because I feel really awkward I it's hard you know it's hard for me to think about what I want to say uh and I and how to like handle group dynamics and all this stuff so it's like it's a lot to handle personally and and so it's hard for me to even save this is going well or not for me because I also don't know the specific directive like I said before so I mean I'm just I'm vibing I guess and uh I mean I'm excited to see where this ends up going because like it's hard for me in the moment to understand like where are we going great question so so Zell first of all top-notch feedback bro seriously right so Zell shared with us what his like he's like what on Earth are we doing here so I'd love to because you like objectives we're gonna we're gonna bail you out a little bit okay so here's been my experience working with people there's a couple different ways you can help people one is you show up and you say hey by the way here's an eight-week curriculum I've never met any y'all before but I have all the answers and I'm going to give you this on week one and it's going to help you and it's going to give you this on week two and this on week three this on week four but in my experience that actually does not help people very much because there's no individuality of it now you can organize a class that way but the whole point of the group coaching experience is that it doesn't have to be a class so we have opportunities available which we don't need a curriculum that goes from week one to week eight now that makes people really confused and very uncomfortable because that's not how School Works we're conditioned to be told what we need to do to improve but the whole point of that I was about to say though but that's how my brain works the way like this conversation that we've all had today is fine yeah me like so so they're definitely different people the open format is more comfortable for some people and some people are more organized right mechanical engineering degree makes sense and and also the other thing that I'm going to share with you Zell is just a kind of hypothesis is that oftentimes when people come in with a problem that's actually not the problem so there's this concept that I think originally sort of came out from Carl Jung where he talked he said that in our psychology we have this part of our psychology called The Shadow and the shadow is the part of our psychology that we're not really aware of it's the stuff that we suppress and so by definition all of our problems come from the Shadow or most of our problems come from the Shadow and the reason they come from the shadow is because the stuff that we're aware of is the stuff that we know how to fix it's the stuff that we're unaware of that we we haven't addressed right because we're not aware of it we don't realize it's a problem so the challenge there is that if I'm if I can see 180 degrees in front of me and I'm running into trouble and I'm I'm not aware that there's anyone behind me or anything behind me then I'm going to naturally say hi I need help with this thing in front of me this thing in front of me this thing in front of me this thing in front of me but what I don't realize is that most of my problems are actually the stuff that I've never considered or am unaware of that's the other reason why the open format actually works really well because you can come in and say I struggle with this I struggle with this I struggle with this but here's the thing all we all are successful content creators all of y'all are good at what you do all of y'all can optimize all of you all have success in your past and hopefully in your future and so if we really want to deliver the most value to you the exploration comes before right so in medicine we say good diagnosis precedes good treatment I'm not going to give you all the treatment I'm not going to give you any treatment technically but you know we're not going to give you the answers on week one and I think it's actually arrogant to assume that we would and like I said I've got a curriculum prepared and you know a lot of it's similar but this is where I know it's going to be unusual for you Zell which is totally fine right and we're going to help you become more comfortable but that's part of the reason that we do it this way because you may be surprised at what's holding you back you may be surprised you may think like oh like do I do the metrics or you know I'm known for this or stuff like that and like there may be a lot of core stuff here I mean I remembered a couple of things that kind of jumped out to me that were sort of like you know what's going on with this person and like who are you because when it comes to like you know what's the right choice do I do this or do I do this there's not like a right choice and a wrong choice the choice depends on you so we have to start by understanding Who You Are right so I'll give you all just one simple example of this so we talked about the theme of loneliness and this is the kind of thing where if you're lonely and you're making content to fix your loneliness what kind of content would you make versus if you learn how to no longer be lonely you deal with that loneliness in here what kind of content can you make it's kind of a weird abstract question right I don't know if it makes sense to people or not may just be a bad question but that's where like what we want to do as content creators is we want to like learn about ourselves we want to like you know grow as people and then we want to be free from all of our negativity when we make content and so it's going to be a little bit weird I don't really know where it's going but what I do know is I've done this time and time and time again and it tends to work really really really well is that enough structure for you Zell I think that makes sense okay other feedback dots uh from a technical standpoint um I know I was told not to look at chat I'm sorry but I looked at chat uh there were there were some people who said that they weren't sure who was who and so like maybe in the next streams we could have like labels or whatever on everyone's um camera and some people are asking for links in the uh stream or the guest command or whatever so yeah so why don't we take this opportunity for you all to just re intro just tell people where they can find you and what kind of streaming you do right so for people who missed the beginning um oh yeah so I can respond to somebody there uh so yeah my name is not pink hair guy but uh it's it's metric seconds everyone calls me metric um I stream at twitch.tv metricseconds um oh my God look at that that's beautiful look at that command that was so fast um I okay anyway I was not prepared uh I like to play games on the hardest settings and suffer uh and I run a very open-end accepting Community uh and uh we focus on everyone feeling safe um and happy while I suffer I'll I'll chime in next uh hi I'm smirky uh I uh yeah someone said that I look like PewDiePie and on the contrary I get that a lot actually so uh and I would actually there's one time I used like one of those like apps where it's like you compare your pictures and it shows someone else's picture and it showed his and I was like whoa that's crazy anyways going off on a tangent here um I'm the Toontown streamer when we keep talking about Toontown that's me uh I've been streaming for about 10 years been on Twitch uh since
