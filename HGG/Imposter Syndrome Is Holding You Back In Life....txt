today we're going to talk a little bit about imposter syndrome and let's start off by understanding what the experience of having imposter syndrome is like the people with imposter syndrome oftentimes feel like imposters they feel like they're living a fake life they tend to be terrified that one day someone will figure out that they don't actually belong they sort of have have this impression of themselves that they've somehow managed to skate by and trick everyone into thinking that they're competent and so they always kind of feel like the House of Cards is about to come tumbling down so it's a very stressful experience to feel like an imposter and to have imposter syndrome hey there thanks for watching and I'm glad these videos have been helpful a lot of times I'll read the comments and see people asking well what do I actually do about it which is a great question and unfortunately the resources out there haven't been that great which is precisely why I started HD in the first place HG coaches are trained on a curriculum that integrates my understanding of what motivates us what paralyzes us and most importantly what leads to Lasting behavioral change if you're ready to take the next step HG coaches can help you build the life that you want they've helped people build careers help people find relationships build networks of friends and even do things like discover their passions or pursue Hobbies so if this sounds like something that you'd be interested in check out the link Link in the description below there are a couple of other key features which are really important to understand the most important is actually that someone's accomplishments don't actually lead to a sense of competence so if we look at a normal person when I succeed or accomplish something what tends to happen is my self-esteem gets a boost right like after all I was successful I did a good job I should feel better about myself but with someone with imposter syndrome the opposite actually happens when someone with imposter syndrome succeeds or accomplishes something instead of at actually boosting their competence they somehow arrive at the conclusion that they've faked it that they don't actually deserve to be successful they they didn't actually achieve something through their own effort and so paradoxically the better they do the worse they feel about themselves and so where does imposter syndrome really come from how does someone start to think this way and so research shows that it actually begins usually in childhood so there are two main sort of profiles of people who develop imposters syndrome the first profile is sibling of a golden child or gifted kid so these are situations in which someone grew up having a usually an older sibling who's very very accomplished and frequently that families would make comparisons between the person who eventually develops imposter syndrome and The Golden Child these are situations in which growing up you know parents will say things like oh you know your oldest sibling is so smart they're so talented they do such a good job it seems like the older sibling is effortlessly successful and meanwhile you've got the younger sibling who's terrified and struggling to keep up because they've got very very big shoes to fill a lot of Parental expectations and if my older brother and sister are able to do it I should be able to do it too the other interesting thing is that the other group of kids who grew up to have imposter syndrome actually deal with those pressures directly themselves they are sort of viewed as a gifted kid or Golden Child and these kids tend to come from high achieving families that put a lot of pressure on their kids and the key thing here is that parents of children who grow up to have imposter syndrome will appreciate the child's accomplishments but won't appreciate or actually denigrate the efforts that the child has to go through so these are parents who wouldn't sort of say hey you did you got an A that's a really good job you must have worked really really hard to get that a in fact what these parents will do is they'll say they'll sort of assume that the child should get an a right because you're smart and because we're smart and because you're so smart and talented everything should be easy for you and so when they start to deal with a child who sort of and kind of put a pressure on them that everything should be easy for you what does that do to the child it creates a very very scary situation where oh I managed to do a good job which is what I was supposed to do right so like I got an A that's what I'm supposed to do but it's supposed to be easy for me but it actually it was hard for me and so what starts to happen is they start to lose confidence in themselves and they start to believe that achievement should be effortless in nature and if I am having to work hard to get an A then there must be something wrong with me so these are the two backgrounds that lead to imposter syndrome if we kind of tunnel down to what is the common shared feature the most common feature of imposter syndrome is this idea that the more success you have the more you accomplish the less competent you feel in yourself and this is something that I was I got super interested in so when I was doing my residency at Massachusetts General Hospital we got a lot of kids who were like college students from MIT in Harvard and places like that and I saw something really Czar which is that these kids should feel really confident in themselves right these are some of the smartest kids most talented kids most accomplished kids in university in the United States and yet they have really bad self-esteem problems and as I continued working with kind of like high Achievers I noticed that imposter syndrome kept on cropping up over and over and over again and I got kind of confused right because as I worked with like Bankers from places like Goldman Sachs or like you know other really talented people entrepreneurs CEOs things like that game developers from like you know very prestigious companies I was super surprised that I was seeing more and more and more imposter syndrome and so I started to think a little bit about okay hold on a second like why is this okay so we sort of know that the more you accomplish you're not able to develop a sense of competence but why is it that all of these people at high performing institutions are winding up with imposter syndrome because I thought that imposter syndrome is like a bad thing right these are people who are suffering with imposter syndrome they're stressed out all the time they're afraid that everything is going to come crashing down around them but this is when I sort of realized that imposter syndrome isn't a bug it's actually a feature and if you look at research on imposter syndrome which you begin to realize and if you work with these people is that the reason that imposter syndrome is so prevalent and is so hard to deal with is because it's actually an advantage in some ways so imposter syndrome is essentially an Adaptive response it's something that's a painful adaptation it's an adaptation that leads to suffering but it's absolutely an adaptation so let's understand why imposter syndrome is actually hard to kick and what it actually does for people so let's start by looking at a normal person okay so a normal person works really really really hard and then they accomplish something they succeed in some way and when they succeed in something they feel good about themselves and what do they do they go out and they celebrate on the flip side someone with imposter syndrome when they work really really really hard and they achieve something how do they feel about themselves they feel terrified they feel like oh my God I got so lucky I barely scraped by I got so lucky that the professor likes me otherwise I wouldn't have gotten an A and so what do they do after they get an A they actually double their efforts they actually work twice as hard they don't relax at all they actually work harder because remember if in your mind you are maintaining this elaborate facade that could come crumbling down around you at any moment you can't relax at all right because if if you make a single mistake everything's gonna come tumbling down you have no sense of Reserve you have no sense of resilience you can't rely on things to work for you and it's because you're kind of like screwing up right like you're on the verge of everything coming crashing down there's no room for relaxation and so now we can begin to see that the behavior of someone with imposter syndrome actually leads them to more and more success which is precisely why you have more and more imposters in more successful places and for the record you know back in residency I did a lot of work with like homeless people I worked in the jail for a few months and I didn't see a single case of imposter syndrome in the homeless population there aren't people out there who are like oh my God I'm not really homeless like people are going to figure this out and that everything is going to come crashing around in fact imposter syndrome correlates with outward achievement and so this is the really bizarre thing is that these are people who should feel really confident in themselves in fact imposter syndrome just as a quick historical side note was actually discovered in high functioning and high performing women who despite the fact that they were very very successful felt like imposters so now that we understand that imposter syndrome actually encourages people to work extra hard and is sort of like an adaptation that leads to more success and accomplishment how do we tackle this and this is where things get a little bit tricky because technically imposter syndrome is not actually a psychiatric diagnosis so you can't be diagnosed with imposter syndrome because it's not even officially recognized by therapists psychologists psychiatrists and furthermore it's not something that the average psychologist or psychiatrist or therapist gets any training in so if you look at the formal kind of curriculum that therapists get trained in imposter syndrome usually has zero hours of training and this is something unfortunately that we've had to deal with at healthy gamer because we get a lot of clients in our coaching program who've actually tried therapy and discovered that the amount of help that they got with imposter syndrome was highly variable so the therapists were really good at dealing things with like anxiety disorders and mood disorders but unfortunately we've seen a lot of unfortunate outcomes in terms of imposter syndrome and therapy now this doesn't mean that you can't get help from a therapist and I've worked with a bunch of people with imposter syndrome and I think I've been able to help them a lot I have a lot of colleagues who've been very successful but you should know that your mileage may vary so today what we're going to do is talk a little bit about how imposter syndrome gets maintained so that you can challenge some of the cognitive patterns that you may be dealing with so researchers have discovered something really interesting when it comes to imposter syndrome since it's not really a diagnosis it kind of gets maintained through particular patterns so unlike something like a mood disorder which may be like neurotransmitter mediated or things like that like maybe a serotonin deficiency or for example a panic disorder is an inappropriate activation of your adrenaline system it seems like imposter syndrome is actually reinforced through particular cognitive patterns and what we're going to share with you today is what those patterns are how to find them and even how to counteract them so the first pattern involving imposter syndrome is not attributing your success to your effort so if you talk to an imposter and you ask them okay why are you successful you'll get lots of answers that have nothing to do with them oh I I ended up going to Harvard because my parents are smart I ended up going uh getting promoted because I'm lucky I ended up Landing that contract because uh you know the people thought I was very friendly or they took pity on me the successes of people with imposter syndrome are actually never taken on by themselves so they always attribute their successes to some external factor or luck and when you do that what that sort of means is that you can't log a w in the W column right because you don't really deserve to be successful that success has nothing to do with your actual competence and so this is what's really interesting there's actually research that shows that you can actually ask someone with imposter syndrome to think a little bit about what they did to deserve a win and this is the kind of thing that we'll teach our coaches and it actually works surprisingly well is simply to ask someone so anytime you have some sort of accomplishment you sort of think a little bit about what you did to deserve it and think a little bit past your knee-jerk reactions for why you're successful so instead of just assuming that you were lucky and that's why you got an A oh it turns out that I missed one review session and that review session wasn't on a test that's why I got the a whereas this person is ignoring the 90 of the stuff that they did right they went to class every day they did their homework every day they went to all the other review sessions that were on the test they got notes from a friend so there's a really interesting cognitive pattern that happens in people with imposter syndrome which is that they actually devalue their own efforts that lead to success so what you want to do if you struggle as an imposter is any time you're successful pay attention to that first thing that your mind says which is that you're lucky and instead think a little bit about what did you do to deserve this the second cognitive pattern that maintains imposter syndrome is that we attribute other people's successes to hard work so when someone else gets promoted when someone else gets an a that's because they worked really hard and they really deserve it right they didn't get lucky there was no nepotism involved or anything like that everyone else's successes they deserve but my successes I don't deserve so the second cognitive pattern that we need to attack is that one so this is a situation where when you see someone else succeed what is your default response in your mind wow they really deserve it and so this is where what we actually want to do is flip the script a little bit and start to ask yourself well what are the advantages that they had in what ways did they get lucky and even articulating some of this stuff starts to challenge this cognitive pattern the third cognitive pattern in imposter syndrome is an emphasis on pleasing others so when when you're successful or not it really has nothing to do with you so your idea of success if you're an imposter is is what do other people think so if I get an A and this is where kind of that high achieving families Dynamic comes in when I get an A what do other people think about it that's what imposters care about so if you're a kid who grew up with a sibling who was a golden child even if you get an A no one is proud of that accomplish in and of itself right they're not proud of that accomplishment what they're proud of what you're kind of doing is you're comparing your accomplishments to other people so one of the things that we know about people with imposter syndrome is they're very very concerned with external opinions and external validation and that's why we're so terrified of of you know everything coming crashing down and people will will it'll be revealed that we're imposters and we don't actually deserve our success so when you succeed the mind of someone that with imposter syndrome is going to default to thinking about what other people think so when I get an A on a test I'm not happy until my parents say good job kid you're so smart when I do a good job at work what I really care about about I can't relax or feel competent or feel proud until my boss says good job and once I've made my boss happy I have maintained the scam right this is another day that's gone by at work where they haven't figured out I'm incompetent and my boss still thinks that I'm a good person right so we really care what other people think and we're not able to take pride in our own accomplishments the idea that I can be proud of something and someone else may be disappointed in it is completely foreign to someone with imposter syndrome that just does not compute at all there's no way I can be proud of something and someone else be disappointed in something and so this is the thing that we kind of want to tackle is to develop a sense of pride in our own accomplishments and that too can be done somewhat simply by simply asking yourself okay when you do a good job at something how do you feel about it and you may say well how do I know if I've done a good job well you just think about it for a second right so if you went to work today you can ask yourself what can I be proud of that I did today if you cooked a meal what can you be proud of what are you actually satisfied with was the meal tasty to you is there any part of it that you can be proud of and the key thing is that people with imposter syndrome actually skip this step they try really hard to skip that step and they substitute it with well what did other people think about the meal that I made so if you want to challenge this cognitive pattern of imposter syndrome just stop for a second and think a little bit about what can I take prior pride in what can I actually be proud of so at the end of the day imposter syndrome is something that we're seeing more and more and more and bizarrely the people with imposter syndrome are the ones that kind of deserve it the least so the more accomplished you are the more likely you are to to feel imposter syndrome and we've seen this a lot in our career coaching program in our creator coaching program where we work with people like YouTube creators and twitch creators and all of them have imposter syndrome and why is that it's because imposter syndrome is not actually it while it's harmful it's also adaptive so it's a harmful adaptation and how is it adaptive well that's because someone with imposter syndrome instead of celebrating when they do a good job what they actually do is panic and work twice as hard and if you really think about it instead of celebrating if you're panicking all the time and working twice as hard do you suffer sure but you're also going to be very very accomplished and very successful because you're working hard all the time and as people are able to acknowledge the things that they've done that deserve success as people are able to acknowledge that if someone else is successful maybe they got a little bit lucky too and lastly as people are able to take pride in themselves instead of relying on someone else's validation that's when you see start to see imposter syndrome get a lot better
