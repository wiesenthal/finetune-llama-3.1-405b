so if i'm hearing your situation correctly you're a very good friend to have you're very emotionally supportive you're kind of like the therapist's friend and in the past you've had trouble setting limits on that so i asked you do you want to support people and you were like yes absolutely and so oddly enough i wonder if the problem is that like you're not actually able to do something that you find fulfilling which is like supporting your friends if the primary source of your emotional drain is being a therapist for your friends if you stop being a therapist for your friends it should follow that you no longer feel drained but you've stopped being a therapist for your friends for about six months right and you still feel emotionally drained that doesn't make sense to me i feel like there's something here that's missing hello welcome hi nice to meet you nice to meet you too i'm sedona nice to meet you sedona what what's your situation how can we help awesome so i my question was about how to rebuild and gain like emotional mana again after losing it so like i'm like a pretty empathetic person and i've been like the therapist friend for like a lot of my relations growing up and especially online and uh i had like past boundary issues well not knowing how to say no and being burnt out because of school and toxic situations whatever and so i found recently i haven't had that emotional manner to have like deep conversations or be there to support others and even having the energy to like watch your videos and whatnot has been difficult so i was wondering if you had any advice on like how to gain that back again yeah so i heard you say something about boundary issues can you help me understand that a little bit yeah so i had trouble like separating myself from the other person like i would always like put them ahead of myself and i wouldn't know how to stay known and how that separation between like their interests and my interests and um yeah maintaining my own in the relationship so so you you can't just adapt to what they wanted and so you use the past tense so is that not an issue now like have you learned how to set boundaries around that so it's like a work in progress but i feel like i've made a lot of progress if that makes sense yeah absolutely so and you still feel kind of emotionally drained yes and how long have you been emotionally drained um probably like months like probably since like january or february to be honest and and how long have you put limits on the amount of emotional support that you put on other people i mean that you give to other people um since last november i think so let me just get this timeline straight so you're just also give a summary for groothie and if i missed something please let me know sedona so if i'm hearing your situation correctly you're a very good friend to have you're very emotionally supportive you're kind of like the therapist friend and in the past you've had trouble setting limits on that and found that kind of work at work friendship very emotionally draining and so it's a work in progress you're learning how to better set limits with people in terms of your own bandwidth and kind of putting them ahead of you but what i'm sort of hearing is that it's been about six months since you've stopped being kind of like a battery for other people and charging people at your own expense um but you're still feeling emotionally drained so yeah i i could also be like i'm also in i just finished my school i have like 14 classes a week so i was probably very burnt out from that as well but it's uh yeah i am feeling emotionally drained i was feeling better for a while but then uh i don't know i haven't had the mana i have a question do you normally um give more than you receive in relationships yeah well like before yes now i feel like i've been doing a bit more receiving uh which is nice but overall course of life yes yes okay so recently so it's not just that you're giving less it's that you're receiving more yeah recently yes and how is that helping um i feel bad to be honest i feel like i'm not pulling my weight yeah i i can i didn't mean to lie because like i can see how if when you receive emotional support if that makes you feel guilty for not pulling your weight i can see how that's not really gonna charge your battery no right does that make sense yeah are you an extrovert yes yeah i am you have thoughts well i have kind of more questions like when you hang out with your friends like do you all have fun or is it more like talking and dinner like sorry not that talking and dinner isn't fun but like do you guys go out and do stuff or do you guys kind of more talk and process and stuff um with my online relationships it used to be a lot more talking processing but like as of recently and i've cut out some not great people it's been more like doing things and having fun and and whatnot which has been awesome and in person as well to answer the question and how does that does that help you kind of recharge or are you still emotionally exhausted like after that kind of stuff i feel like i am like recharged but i still feel emotionally exhausted for like the deeper conversations oh yeah i i don't yeah you feel uh from the deeper from the deeper conversations to have the deeper conversations like i i feel like distracted in them i feel like i'm not there a hundred percent do you want to have deeper conversations yeah i love like being there for other people like it brings me so much joy um and i want to have that again but it just feels like tiring and like i am unable to be present what do you think i think she's tired i think you're tired but i don't think it's like it sounds like your social life is going in a fairly good like it's going in the direction that you choose and it sounds like if you want your friendships to be um going out you can have that if you want to have the deeper conversations you can have that if you want to give more you can if you want to give less you can't so it sounds like you're kind of it sounds it sounds like something else is happening that this isn't about your friendships it sounds like you're just kind of tired yeah so i would sort of echo that because here's here's how i'm thinking about it sedona and you let me know if this kind of fits or not so like if the primary source of your emotional drain is being a therapist for your friends if you stop being a therapist for your friends it should follow that you no longer feel drained right yeah but you've stopped being a therapist for your friends for about six months right and you still feel emotionally drained yeah so that doesn't make sense to me i feel like there's something here that's missing and it could just be more time like maybe you need another six months um but generally speaking i'd like you know i think that six months after a draining influence is gone you should be like kind of on the road to recovery there so a couple of other possibilities could be that there's like other weird stuff going on like you you're carrying around this guilt other stuff could be like do you feel resentful towards your friends and you're sort of carrying that around no okay the other thing that could be kind of bizarre is that so people who are emotionally supportive to others that can actually be like so so i asked you do you want to support people and you were like yes absolutely i love it so much and so oddly enough i wonder if the problem is that like you're not actually able to do something that you find fulfilling which is like supporting your friends and this is where like if you think about sort of the life of a therapist you know we find our work invigorating because we find it genuinely rewarding and we also find it draining so in a weird way what could be going on is that that the way that you recharge it is also by like helping people yeah which is which is bizarre but that's another possibility there's just something about this the scenario that you're describing where i feel like there's a blind spot somewhere okay also sometimes one person takes all of our like like 90 of our energy is from like one or two people do you have like energy vampires in your life i would say so yes well i i had even worse ones but i got rid of them uh which sounds bad to say but i did and i do have some in my family as well um yeah yeah so so i think that's where so i know it's gonna sound kind of weird but what i would say is even if you're not fully there try helping one person one time and see what happens to your battery like what you need i think is more information because something about this is and then the other thing is is i mean if you've got energy vampires in your family that you can't escape from that's why your battery's drained yeah yeah so i'm hearing that you're moving in the right direction but that you may still have a way to go i think that's an accurate description yes in which case i'd say just keep on moving in my condolences that you have you know you've had to walk so far so already if you enjoy um maybe one kind of no strings attached way of like being able to have those conversations and not have any additional baggage would be to like volunteer or like consider coaching or something like that where maybe you can help other people engage in those conversations but not have an added burden and then your general relationships can be more reciprocal right you don't get into like those kind of bad patterns of like giving more receiving more okay here i'm writing it down one second so i don't forget the last thing that i would mention is that if this persists for a few more months and gets worse and you find that your battery being drained and you being out of mana is like really starting to cause problems in your life i'd highly recommend that you get like a medical evaluation or like an evaluation by a psychologist too so sometimes one of the key hallmarks of something like major depressive disorder is that it's triggered by a particular circumstance but yeah persists independent of the circumstance being resolved right so that's just where if you're really seeing like an impairment and function like you know like ruthie's sort of saying like you may want to look at some kind of outside support and i wouldn't rule out some kind of medical evaluation as well i don't i don't think she needs outside support i think she should she should be a coach or like be a crisis text line volunteer or like like if if she wants a way to give and know that she's giving but doesn't have like the added baggage of like feeling guilty for not having done more or like that kind of stuff i think that could be a good outlet for you okay sorry if that was unclear thank you yeah what are you thinking sedona um i [Music] i am volunteering at the moment but i do think that trying to help someone again um and like just just do it for once and not have that that like strings attachment may give me more information um and i would like to try again um yeah i think that's good and also i was interested in what you had to say basis on like one singular moment could cause that master depressive disorder because i was interested in that if you wouldn't mind uh clarifying more what you meant by that i'm sorry can i clear oh yeah so so if you just you know just general education about things like major depressive disorder so the way that we differentiate between let's say like stress in your life like how do we know if str if you're struggling and that's result to a stress in your life or is due to something like major depressive disorder so a key aspect is that if something is due to stress in your life if the stress gets better your mental health should get better with it right does that kind of logically follow exactly so one of the key things that we sort of think about in the field of mental health is that if symptoms persist when the stress has resolved that can be an independent kind of major depressive disorder or something like that so what i was sort of suggesting to you is that you know this may be the kind of situation we have no idea like you know what you're actually experiencing on a day-to-day basis and that's sort of like on purpose because it's not our job to evaluate you for measuring depressive disorder but if you're having you know if you're kind of feeling like you're really struggling in some ways and that you're maybe kind of underplaying what you're sharing with us or it persists for a very long time and your battery should be getting charged and it isn't being isn't uh getting charged then i would talk to a doctor about that because that could be all kinds of stuff it's not even necessarily depression like you could have a hormonal imbalance there could be something like sleep apnea or anemia or like all kinds of stuff that can happen to people so what i'm saying is that oftentimes people will think they'll think like oh if i'm struggling in some way like i should change something about my interactions it's something that i'm doing it's something that i'm eating whereas like sometimes it's just medical and you just need to get some expert advice and support there okay does that offer enough context yes that makes sense thank you good luck thank you i appreciate your time i feel like we weren't able to give you as satisfactory as an answer yeah i think there's a lot of specifics under there that we would really have to get into i think so too it's a pretty general question for like yeah probably you'd need more context which would take longer than just this time but i do appreciate your insight so far yeah so i i think try helping out someone see what that does and you know if you've got energy vampires in your family that can be rough yeah true that can explain a lot of it so good luck okay have a good rest of your streaming day bye thank you you
