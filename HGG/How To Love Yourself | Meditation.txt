so we're going to talk for a second about met the meditation so method meditation is called loving also known as loving kindness meditation and we're going to talk to y'all a little bit we're going to go through we're going to do it at the end of stream today together but before we do that we're going to go ahead and take a look at some of the components of it okay this is where what we want to kind of look at is first of all meta means kindness and i think meta is a polyword so it's not sunscreen so what we want to do is cultivate the compa cultivate a capacity for kindness and why is this important so let's remember that if we're talking about someone who is let's say the lonely desperate male or person the first thing to understand is that oftentimes you know you have thoughts like ugly i'm desperate these are people who are starved for affection so how do you think they feel about themselves right so they have a very um what's the right word harsh view of self and then this then projects out into a harsh view of the world right because beauty is in the eye of the beholder and when my eyes are so used to seeing a harsh view of the self what i end up seeing is a harsh view of the world as well and if we look at these people they have difficulty with empathy they have difficulty with compassion they have difficulty with social connectedness as we've sort of already talked about they also have difficulty with things like depression and anxiety negative feelings worries is maybe another way to put it right and then they also have difficulty with like life forward choices for lack of a better term so this includes things like health promotion behaviors but i would say on a on a deeper level it's more like when we say work on yourself that involves all kinds of like things about moving your life forward and they struggle with motivation in these things and let's understand how that works okay so now how can cultivating a capacity for kindness help with these sorts of things so let's kind of think about that so the first is so method meditation involves kindness towards the self and this is important for the life forward motivation and why is that it's because when i don't think i'm worth it i'm not worth fixing so it's like if i have low value like i want you all to think about the oldest computer you have in your house that doesn't work anymore and i want you to think about how worth it is it to fix that computer which is probably why it's like sitting if you're like me it's like sitting in your garage it's like two decades old and it's just like we haven't thrown it out because we may need it one day but it's not really worth fixing and so when we think a little bit about you know how we how our brain calculates like what's worth fixing it's the things that are valuable and if i'm not valuable i'm not worth fixing and this is what makes it hard to work on myself so we can say work on yourself but like it's hard because it's not you know it's like what's the point so this is important to develop kindness towards yourself and i think met the meditation needs to be modified in my opinion we'll talk about that in a second so we sort of dealt with this okay second thing is when we develop empathy and compassion there's room for someone else in the relationship and this is important because generally speaking i don't think it's the desperation that drives people away i mean it can for sure but i i choose to believe that people are not so selfish as that and like it's not the desperation which you can also get cognitively reinforced because if they try to help you and like you're so unwilling to help them or be helped by them that eventually they get fed up and they have to leave and then what you conclude is that oh i'm too desperate and they smelled it and they ran away whereas that person is going to have an experience of that relationship which oftentimes is where the misdiagnosis comes in we don't really like talk to them about it right because we're not really able to hear it and when i have a cognitive bias that i'm a low value person and someone says yeah like i tried to help you and i just like it wasn't working and you're like oh that means i couldn't be helped i'm unhelpable so that's what your mind is going to conclude with this is exactly what you see in therapies like when you have people have very low self-worth they will take whatever you say and they will spin it in the worst possible thing and they will use it as evidence to reinforce their existing beliefs so when you have emp when you develop empathy and compassion for other people there's going to be room for someone else in the relationship and then this in turn is going to reduce the feeling of being an object potentially for you and and the other person in the relationship this is huge so then we kind of talk a little bit about social connectedness and i think this essentially follows from this right so like as you connect with another human being as you acknowledge yourself as a person as you acknowledge the other person as a person now two people can connect and now it's not about desperate desperate getting your needs met in starvation it's about two human beings forming a relationship and as we do all these things we can actually set ourselves up to like actually engage in healthy relationships so now the question becomes okay so if i've convinced you at this point then like now we get to the how so what is this method meditation and how does it work so i'm going to talk to you all about traditional met the meditation and when i do met the meditation my kind of modified or digital digitalgen generation met the meditation because i think some things have changed so traditionally when you do met the meditation what you'll do is you'll start with some kind of phrase so like may you be happy may you be free may you be a peace so you'll repeat this thought directed towards a particular group of people or person so like you'll just literally practice like wishing for the object of your meta that these things happen to them may this person be happy may this person be free and may this person be at peace now there are a couple of important things here three really important elements the first is the word may this moves away from determinism and if we look at this this this is all deterministic like if we talk to people who are desperate and alone they have a very deterministic view of the world no women will love me because i'm ugly deterministic statement i don't talk to women and none like me deterministic statement i'm emotionally abused and don't know how to talk to women deterministic statement i don't feel comfortable with women even deterministic right doesn't say i sometimes there's no it's all flat it may be valid we're not saying it's wrong but it's deterministic so so like i want you to just think about this for a second if this person said you know it may be hard for some women to love me because of the way that i look versus no women will love me because i'm ugly which of those statements is healthier i don't talk to women and none like me versus it's hard for me to talk to women and some of them don't like me do you all see the difference between those two statements so literally met the meditation starts by getting away from determinism it acknowledges that there are things outside of my control and that the future is not set in stone so it practices this faculty second thing it does is moves focus away from the self this is the other problem that these kinds of people have is that if you look at this sort of internal sense of distress this is a very self-focused distress personal distress so we need to move away from that personal element we need to start we need to practice and train our mind to think about the thoughts and feelings and experiences of others sure i'm lonely and starved for affection but what does this person need what is their experience of this interaction so we need to move away from the eye and move towards the you and the third element which is really important is just the cultivation of positivity now this is sort of a this is a a tight rope to be sure so it's very easy for the cultivation of positivity to move into denial of toxicity so we don't we want to be accepting we want to be positive but we don't want to invalidate or deny the experience of negativity or toxicity but we can absolutely hope for and wish for positivity so may this person be free may this person be happy may this person be at peace now traditionally so these actually we're going to keep these are all the same and in terms of the modified i think what what we've really done is understand the components of met the meditation i don't know that people explain this stuff when they teach meth the meditation they just say you just need to repeat this stuff so we try to add in our modified method meditation is an understanding of the psychology at play here when you cultivate these kinds of thoughts now traditionally these thoughts are directed towards five sets of people the first is they're directed towards the self so you say you know may i be happy or like you kind of externalize yourself a little bit so we'll kind of talk about that but you don't say i you say like you know like envision yourself and direct that happiness towards yourself almost as an external person like imac like close your eyes and imagine like a bird's eye view of like you sitting in a room and like look at that person and try to say may this person be happy may this person be free and may this person be at peace you can use i if you want to second thing is traditionally they would then direct it towards a guru or teacher okay third thing is they direct it towards a friend fourth thing is directed towards a neutral party fifth thing is they direct it towards an enemy so if we kind of think a little bit about wishing these thoughts traditionally they met the people believe that it's easy to wish for yourself happiness we all want happiness for ourselves next thing is that this is back in the day of gurus so it's like easy to like want happiness and peace and stuff for your guru because they're your teacher you respect them etc next thing it's easy to direct good vibes towards friends harder to direct good vibes towards because it's someone who's doing a lot for you so you have presumably natural gratitude directed towards this so we all have self-love we all have gratitude friends is like maybe less so than someone who's like teaching you this stuff but you know it's you have good vibes pretty easily harder is towards people who are neutral and the hardest is to try to love or wish good things for your enemies now in the modern day i think this changes so the first is that i think this is just someone you respect so i would start with someone that you respect and appreciate it doesn't have to be a friend so if you've had like you know a teacher who's had a large impact on your life like an uncle or family member who's been very positive towards you i think we want to step away from sort of the spiritual traditions in some ways so i think definitely here we want to do that so you don't have to direct it towards a guru second thing is we're going to do friend and can you wish for your friend to be happy can you say to yourself authentically that may this person be happy may this person be free may this person be at peace can you say that for someone that you respect can you say that for a friend of yours generally speaking i hope so now this is where things get interesting depending on how you feel about yourself self is either number three or number four so when you think about yourself i think it's unfortunate but a lot of people that i've worked with can't view themselves even lower than neutral so if they say to them if they start to send good vibes towards themselves and by good vibes i mean literally repeating these thoughts with as much authenticity as you can muster and compassion as you can muster it feels wrong it's like i don't actually deserve that crap i'm a pos et cetera et cetera et cetera if that's the case that's okay we're gonna move you down to the higher difficulty no problem so can you direct them towards someone you respect and someone who you appreciate someone your friend of yours good someone neutral then yourself and then lastly an enemy so this is what i would say is easier for modern day met the meditation maybe self is number three maybe self is number one and you can do it and that's totally fine there's no but the goal here is to try to remember that when we're trying to cultivate a new faculty in the mind what we want to do is try to reduce the conflict in our mind so we want to start with a thing that's easiest it's almost like we're going to play the tutorial before we get to level one and then we're going to play level one and then we're gonna play level two and we're gonna play level three now the question is like back in the day this was the tutorial this was level one this was level two we may have to move that around a little bit because we've changed as people and even if you look at like old texts from the karmic religions they sort of say that meditation techniques need to be sort of reinterpreted which is why we have multiple teachers so there were various incarnations of vishnu and these people got revered as divine right so we're probably spiritual teachers essentially juries out on whether they're truly divine or whatever we're going to stay clear of that metaphysics for today and then like later their teachings were reinterpreted by the buddha for a different group of people and then he developed you know buddhism and then later those um you know teachings have been reinterpreted by people like the dalai lama by people like you know eckhart tolle like all these other teachers that have come even your local meditation teacher or yoga teacher will offer their own perspective and people will gravitate to them so these teachings which may be true continuously get reinterpreted and so based on like my understanding of the population that we kind of in the world that we live in like this may be easier and the goal is to authentically cultivate compassion towards these objects and to formulate that compassion in this particular phrasing which i think the phrasing is powerful and specific and there's a reason why it's structured that way so now we're gonna practice met the meditation and the goal here is that like you know we're gonna cultivate hopefully all of these things and we know actually interestingly enough scientifically that this works right so we have data from scientific studies that show that these are the outcomes that we can expect from a rigorous method meditation practice okay so let's go to the practice itself so like i mentioned there's going to be may you be happy may you be free and may you be at peace and what we're essentially going to do is direct we're going to repeat each of these phrases three times while directing it towards a particular person and what i want you to do is just in yourself try to muster up as much authentic compassion as you can so you know when you like really want something like man i really hope eldon ring is not a disappointment man i can't wait to play elderly man it's so awesome or when someone says oh yeah i just started playing elden ring you're like dude you are in for a treat or man that sucks i'm so sorry for you you know so this is where you can generate an authentic emotional experience when thinking about someone else i'm so excited for you oh you've never been to hawaii it's amazing man you're going to have the time of your life i really hope you have a fantastic vacation so you can generate authentic compassionate statements directed towards other people so we're going to try to do that with these three phase phrases and so what i want you to do is as best as you can hope that this person really kind of put it out into the universe that like may this person be happy may this person be free of worries or free and may this person be at peace i hope they don't stress i hope they don't suffer and so we're going to pick a someone that you respect or you appreciate first and we're going to say this three times i'm going to do it silently but you can do it out loud if you want to and so imagine that person picture them in your mind and then repeat this each phrase three times so and you can do it kind of in order so maybe happy maybe free may you be at peace maybe happy may be free may you be at peace and then what we're going to do is we're going to move on to a friend and then we're going to move on to a neutral person and then we're going to move on to ourselves and then we're going to move on to someone we dislike okay and i want you to just notice the natural cultivation of the feelings that you get if you wind up feeling really positive towards yourself then you can absolutely move yourself to the top of the list you can also you don't have to do the whole practice with all people right away but we're going to do that today okay so we're going to sit up straight who's first is respected someone that you respect or appreciate okay so close your eyes take a few moments to breathe in and breathe out and now imagine the first person someone you respect and appreciate breathe in and out picture them in your mind and repeat your metaphrases three phrases three times each begin do and now we're going to move on to a friend so imagine a friend someone who you care about and now repeat our met the kindness meditation towards them may you be happy may you be free may you be at peace now we're going to move on to a neutral person just imagine someone that you've interacted with in the last few days picture them as best as possible take a moment to kind of focus your mind on that person and now send them metta kindness through our three phrases and now picture yourself almost as if you were floating above in the room see yourself sitting there and now direct mehta towards yourself may you be happy may you be free may you be at peace and now direct it towards someone who you have negative feelings towards picture that person notice that it may be a little bit harder to recall or call up those feelings of compassion but try anyway fix that person in your mind and send met that to them may you be happy may you be free may you be at peace two more rounds in your mind thank now put your hands together in namaste position as we bring in begin to bring the practice to a close and notice all of the world swirling around you things that you have to do responsibilities that you have goals that you have wants that you have unfulfilled desires pressures worries and that in this moment you can find some modicum of peace as the rest of the world feels outside of you and give thanks for this moment and for the situation that you're in for the person that you are find gratitude for whatever you can in this moment as authentically as you can and with one final breath as you exhale give thanks and open your eyes you
