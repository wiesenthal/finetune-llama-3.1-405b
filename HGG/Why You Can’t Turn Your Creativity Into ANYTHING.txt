but in terms of people who do creative work it's like devote yourself to like the purity of your action man that is what makes human creativity so amazing right i don't know that like when michelangelo made the sculpture of david he was like i want a piece of artwork that will be appreciated for thousands of years i don't know that that was his goal what i imagine his goal is is like i want to make just a magnificent piece of artwork so devote yourself to the action and it's fine to be an artist just make the best art you can possibly make i have tons of creativity but no patience for creating recently i feel like i had a lot of creativity exploding a bit and sadly i never learned any kind of medium to put this creativity into through my life i tried several piano guitar drawing painting but none stick because in my case i was losing patience either i was not good enough to do what i wanted to do or i was getting to a point that i didn't want to pursue the endeavor of trying to get better getting to a stage where you can't get better unless you just do or practice that's getting frustrated and impatient i tried and tried and not don't really know what to do i feel like i need to become a designer project manager and give my creativity that way but not really sure how to do that either it's tons of ideas of video or board game design book or vlog or podcast i tried several but due to the lack of interest from others the ability to advertise such creativity or having any personal talent in any kind of artsy stuff i feel like it prevents me to bloom i feel like this impatience came from video game addiction and that the constant gratification of having fun right now and working for any future thing is not really easy i can on the spur of the moment be really creative for like one or two months but then it goes dormant for a few weeks or months so i guess i'm not sure what to do so this unfortunately is an increasingly common thing that we're seeing that we have people out there who are interested in doing creative work they're interested in doing substantial work they have a lot of like really powerful ideas you know they genuinely want to have a they have a create like an explosion of creative energy and they can even direct that energy for one or two months and make some very serious progress but then inevitably what happens is they lose patience they start to get very very you know concerned about how things aren't really working they start to feel like they're not really living up to their potential and they feel like very very frustrated with themselves right because you know that it's in you like you've got it somewhere in there but you just can't let it out because even this phrase bloom i think is really important because it implies that the flower's right there right the butt is there it's just not able to open so how do you how do you understand this like what do you what do you do if you're in this situation where you have these bursts of creativity but then you either lose patience or you get frustrated you're not really willing to practice you get kind of impatient like how do you manage this this is a great question and so how do you bloom when you're too impatient to right that's the question how do you sort of understand this creative process how do you get yourself to actually create so let's start by kind of understanding a couple of basics okay so what's going on here so the first is how to bloom creatively so let's like take a look at what what this person has like let's look at the pattern so let's try to lay out all the pieces of the puzzle the first is that they have creative energy that comes and bursts and then fizzles okay they also you know will act for a while so they tend to have a problem of follow-through they experience impatience frustration and they're not really able to how did they put it they get to the stage where you can't get better unless you practice okay so stop at the just practice phase and then last thing is that they're curious about whether this has to do with constant gratification from video games so if you're creatively stifled like how can we piece all these elements together what's going on here and how can we start to like move forward in in kind of a positive way so the first thing that i want to do is like talk about proposed answers so if you guys are looking at this there may be some things that are jumping to your mind so the first is let's like look at the situation so i have one month of creativity and then it fizzles so answer number one is discipline i need more discipline right because this this just practice is not something i'm willing to do so answer number one is or so like this first solution we're going to look for is how do i take one month of effort develop discipline so it becomes two months practice becomes three months practice right this is the answer number one develop discipline related to this is we can say things like just practice sorry bro the only way that you're going to learn to be creative is just by doing this okay decent answer okay and now let's try to understand a little bit about so maybe they say it's like you know games have something to do with it so let's think a little bit about games so what happens in a game so we have an action we get a reward action reward and so basically we get rewards every step of the way so the real way that we're going to overcome this is by understanding what is happening in our mind so literally what is like happening in our mind when we play video games what are we actually training our brain to do so i want you all to understand this the brain is kind of like an animal and it does what it's trained to do so for example like if i sit there and i learn the alphabet i will train it time and time and time again it won't be learning the alphabet isn't fun for those of you that especially if you try to like learn a new language like it's not fun right your brain really really dislikes it it really wants to revert back to like speaking the language that is easy for it and that's because the brain is efficient so the brain is designed to be efficient and as it's efficient it detests adversity but you can train it if you teach at the alphabet it'll learn how to read and then it'll be fine so when we play a video game what are we training our brain to do so i have or let's even talk about content algorithms right so let's say like i'm on reddit or youtube and when i get bored of something what do i do i click something else right when i play a video game oh this game is like let me play dota for a little bit ah dota is getting boring let me switch to eldon ring so in games what we're sort of doing is we have an impulse and we gratify the impulse so what are we training our brain to do so neurons that fire together wire together remember that when it comes to how the brain works neurons will fire once and then they'll get a little bit stronger and then it becomes easier to fire again and again and again and again and that's how we form a habit so at that point things are automatic so what have we trained our brains to do by playing tons of video games that have constant gratification we've trained them to do is respond to impulses this is essentially what we've trained our brain to do is when you have an impulse just you don't have to restrain it you don't have to control it you can just gratify it so our brain has been trained to gratify impulses now let's take a look at our person who has creative or creative issues right so when the person has a burst of creativity creative energy what are they doing with their impulses what do you all think what are they doing ah some people are saying nothing i feel like writing a book absolutely acting on impulse let me start a vlog let me start a podcast cool i've got this impulse and it's positive energy right it's creativity i'm moving in the right direction i'm creating something it's an explosion it feels so good let me work on it for a month they're acting on impulse but in a good way and then what happens is they get impatient they get frustrated on day 30. and then they stop what are they doing are they acting on impulse so their mind is telling them i don't want to do this anymore i want to play a video game they have that impulse acting on impulse so this is the key thing that y'all need to understand this is why people get stuck okay y'all need to understand this very clearly explosion of creativity plus discipline equals success this is the formula that everyone who is in this problem looks for they say how can i start here and sustain with discipline and then do this for one year how do i sustain this that's the question it's the wrong question that's why everyone's stuck because this is half the problem this is the same thing starting on an impulse or quitting on an impulse is still acting in relation to an impulse so this is the problem because here's the thing the brighter the candle the faster it burns out right the more excited i've seen this a lot like in relationships too where people who like fall head over heels over like they're like oh my god like this is the best relationship in the universe and then like three months later it's like an absolute train wreck not always often times super super excited about this kind of thing oh my god let's do this let's do this let's do this and then like where is it three months from now i'm gonna order i'm gonna sign up for guitar lessons i'm gonna go go get this guitar and get these really cool pics this pic was signed by my favorite artist oh my god it's gonna be great it's gonna be like i'm gonna play every day we're enjoying it yeah wow i'm my hands hurt my fingers i need i don't i need calluses calluses are taking too long to form it hurts too much to play let me put it down so as long as you're acting on impulse like this is the problem is everyone thinks that explosion of creativity is a good thing and then impatience is the problem so they want to get rid of this and they want to keep this doesn't work like that they're both the problem this is the problem the whole reason is because the way you're starting the task is in the wrong way so you're doomed to failure that doesn't mean that you can't use your explosions of creativity we'll get to that in a second but this is sort of like you know like if you want light throughout the night you don't want to light a firecracker right you want a candle so interestingly enough are if you want to learn how to be better at this you need to train your impulsivity okay so this is like frontal lobe function and remember like people are smart right like people like know things about themselves so even as we look at this statement i feel like impatience came from video game addiction and constant gratification i would trust that instinct do you all see this statement here is a statement of understanding this is a statement of their own experience it's not theoretical this is what they've learned i can on the spur of the moment be really creative for one or two months and then it goes dormant for a couple of weeks these are both part of the problem it's all the same problem the problem is that we think half of it is the solution whereas that's part of the problem too so what do we do about this train your impulsivity okay because if you start in an impulsive way you're giving in to your impulsivity it's going to be hard to stop training giving in to the impulsivity okay so what should you do about this there are lots of different meditations for training your impulsivity essentially any meditation technique will work for this so this is where where i i kind of want to say just meditate but it's not enough to say just meditate what i want you to really do when you meditate is recognize that the reason you are doing this is to level up your impulsivity you're trying to train the animal that is your mind so this is where i think practices like taratica are really good so you're going to stare you know you're going to do fixed point gazing so you can do like candle gazing or something like that and then your mind is gonna wander all over the place and then you're gonna kind of focus on this thing you're gonna train your attention to be on one thing the other thing that you can do is as you do a focusing practice what i want you to do is wait for the wandering mind your mind is gonna wander if you say okay we're gonna concentrate on the smell of this incense smell the incense another really good one here is watch the smoke so watch the smoke that rises from incense like it's going to be a beautiful plume just watch it and then your mind is going to wander and you're going to be waiting for it as it wanders you're going to bring it back so here's the smoke coming up from the incense and your mind is going to go here it's going to go here and then you're going to bring it back and every time you do this this is one push-up for your mind it's one push-up for your impulsivity impulsive action return impulsive action return okay so this is like the first thing you can train your mind second thing slow down your start because remember giving in to the explosion of energy is still giving into the impulse so slow down your start you feel like doing this task for a thousand hours a day don't do it for a thousand hours a day set aside a particular time of your day like so make a schedule and don't give in to the impulses oh i'm going to read about vlogs i'm going to research this i'm going to do that i'm going to download some software i'm going to order a microphone i'm going to do this like don't do all of that set aside a time one to two hours max per day recognize that you have a limited amount of fuel and basically what you need to do is you need to how can i say this uh space out your creative energy to last into habit formation this is the problem so when you engage when you have a burst of creative energy and you're like today i'm doing this i'm gonna start at eight am i'm gonna end at five pm tomorrow i'm to stay up kind of late playing video games and i'm going to start tomorrow at noon and i'm going to go to midnight right i'm going to just like follow my impulses i'm going to research microphones i'm going to look at what these streamers are doing i'm going to look at software today i'm going to look at software from 2 pm to 4 pm you don't build any habits because as long as you're you're like building into that like giving into the creative energy it's like and then yeah on day four i don't feel like doing it i've done a lot of work right because i did a lot of work i did like 20 hours of work on this project which is enough so let me take a break and then like the weekend rolls around and then you're doing this again so this is where what you want to do is marshall that energy right it's kind of like if i'm gonna go from like point a to point b with a candle and i need to light a fire at point b i need to like make sure that candle stays lit i don't want to firework like i need to have that creative energy last until i can start recruiting other parts of my brain like habit formation building a schedule what that also means is that your action so when you do this your actions are going to get decoupled from reward this is huge right so how does this person know when to stop at midnight i guess they're kind of like the impulse is gone or they've achieved some kind of reward or they got lots of rewards that's what's sustaining their energy so the reason i can do it for one month is because just like rpgs or mmos level one to ten you can get in like five hours but level 50 to 60 takes five months same is true for real life right rpgs have captured that mechanic really really well right so what you need to do is decouple your actions from the reward and the way that you do that is by spreading out your creative energy and making a schedule so this is what i'm going to do for today and now suddenly what you're doing is training your brain to be somewhat different which is that the actions are not going to be reward based and they're not going to be impulse based it's going to be in the opposite direction from what video games train you to do and once you start using these things like schedules once you start using meditations you'll start to move in the right way but oftentimes i find that the biggest the trickiest thing is that when people have these bursts of creative energy what they look for is discipline right you have the burst of energy and they don't see this as the problem they see it as like you know the good thing and then what they're missing is discipline so all they're focused on is how do i make discipline how do i make it difficult which is totally fine i mean it's not it's good to build discipline but you have to understand that this whole phenomenon is actually the problem that giving it into the impulses of your mind which is how you're it's trained by video games which is absolutely correct is the problem and what you want to do is don't give in to those impulses space things out harness that creative energy to build a habit as you start to like rein in that creative energy what you will naturally do is decouple actions from reward instead what you'll start to do is instead of getting some kind of dopamine energy oh my god this is so cool this software is awesome instead what we're going to get is like yeah like i did what i was supposed to today good job right this is what i want at the end of the day i want three check boxes that you make the day before that get checked the day after this is what you need to do it's not just like i don't know what i'm going to do no you know check boxes i'm going to just wander over here and then i'm going to wander over here and then let me configure this and let me order that there's no organization to it it's all impulsive flow and as long as you're giving in to that impulsive flow it's going to be very difficult to accomplish anything creatively questions i'm an artist at my full-time job and the session is so helpful fantastic that's what we're here for so someone's saying so basically meditation in a to-do list no it's a very good question so this is the problem when we look at the actual solution it seems simple right so basically a meditation a to-do list the difference so let me put it this way let's say you have two people one person who works out regularly or let's say one person who eats healthy and one person who doesn't eat healthy and so you look at them and you kind of look at their behaviors and you say like so basically just order salad every day right sure that's what it looks like on the outside what's the difference between the person who eats healthy and the person who doesn't eat healthy their actions are different sure but the internal mindset is actually very different this is very important to understand so for the person who eats healthy people assume like if i eat unhealthy people think okay i'm undisciplined and it requires a lot of willpower to overcome my internal impulses so that i can order a salad instead of a burrito and so people look at the action they're like okay i just need to eat salad every day right whereas if you talk to the person who eats healthy how much will power do they use on a daily basis very little very little so when you're asking is it basically a to-do list and meditate that's what it looks like on the outside but if you actually want to succeed it's not about what you do on the outside it's about the internal work it's about the barrier of entry to doing the right thing that's what we need to change and that starts with understanding right when i talk to people who go to the gym five days a week and i ask them how hard is it for you to go to the gym they say it's very easy so that very easy versus very hard is an internal change it's a mindset shift it's some amount of habit that's what you need to change it's not the actions anyone can tell you to like you know i could have just look at this for a second this is not what i did today i didn't say how to bloom creatively make a to-do list meditate that's it rest of this doesn't matter this is all useless useless useless useless i didn't give you a 30 second answer right because what needs to change for people you see this with like alcohol addiction as well where it's like i woke up one day and i just realized that enough is enough how do you become sober just stop drinking that doesn't actually help right sure it's correct but like the struggles that we have are not in the action themselves we all know what to do the struggles we have is the mindset in the internal work so that needs to change and how does that need to change it starts by diagnosing the problem properly which is that giving in to your creative impulses is dooming you to fail that at the end of the day giving in to your creative impulses and giving in to your impatient impulses is still giving in to your impulses if you're misdiagnosing the problem you're going to stay stuck so marshall that creative energy that's the first thing you should do is restraint restraint from joy restraint from burning yourself out through a month of intensive creative activity marshall that creative energy drip it throughout 30 days 60 days 90 days then you'll start to recruit habits then it'll start to be easier for you that's what needs to change is the internal stuff right we have thousand tutorials on youtube telling you you read a thousand books about how to write a best-selling novel we can take as many classes as you want to you can take brandon sanderson's writing class on youtube which is fantastic you can listen to podcasts there's like the answers are out there how do i write a bestselling novel you just sit down and you write that's the problem is the mind seeks a solution it doesn't want to do the internal work so it's about internal resistance understanding why you do what you do understanding your impulses because once you understand like what's under the hood then you can start to make adjustments and as you tweak a little bit here and tweak a little bit there then the results that you get will be quite different so it's so much more than a to-do list in meditation although that is correct that is the essence of it right it's what's on the inside what makes it hard to follow a to-do list what makes it hard to meditate that's what you need to understand that's the individual resistance a wonderful question though someone's asking how do you make it into a habit by slowing it down from the get-go that's how you make it a habit right so slow it down so if you want to like start doing push-ups every day like don't start with 10 start with one right before you go to bed last thing you do i'm gonna squeeze in one push-up before i go to sleep that's how you build a habit okay all right um so oh my god this is such a good question dr can you be truly creative if you turn it into a habit that is when you are the most creative so here's the other thing to understand about creativity when did creativity stop being in our control when did we start treating creativity as different from anything else that we do oh yeah in other dimensions of my life i can have a routine and i can have a habit but when it comes to creativity i'm just gonna send it out the window incorrect so the people who are successful artists are the ones who make a habit of creating it's a skill to access that creative part of yourself right so this is where like if you look at um what's his name mahali shikset mahali right the guy who developed flow he's like talking about developing a process to access that creativity the states of meditation are very similar as well well it's like you can't let me put it to you this way like so you can't create a state of sleep right you can't just feel like i'm asleep no can habit help with sleep absolutely even though you can't create it in fact it facilitates it so when you develop a good creative habit when you develop a good process it primes your brain to like be in the right mode and then once you're in the right mode like the creativity actually flows more easily the problem is that the reason you think creativity only flows at random times is because the way that you've allowed it to flow is only at random times right there's a difference between like relying on rain for water and building a well like if you just wait for it to rain then of course you're going to think the only time i can get water is when it rains what i'm telling you to do is build a well and then suddenly that truth which is just as true the only time the rain comes is like when it rains right that's the only time to get water but if you build a well it completely transforms your ability to do things so habit and creativity can go hand in hand absolutely the problem and it's not even an incorrect conclusion because you just haven't built a well yet right so you just assume based on your prior experience that the only time i've been creative is when it rains that's the only way to get water because that's my experience so question it explore it look at that resistance try building a habit and see what happens to your creativity excellent questions so someone's asking i like art and want to make a career out of it is it wrong to make that a goal and outcome focus yes and no so this is where generally speaking we want action focuses instead of outcome foci but remember that all of these things are not they're not like objectively good or objectively bad what they are i want you all to understand what the options are and choose the appropriate tool so of course like in some ways you want to be outcome oriented right like if i get a job for example i need to be like outcome oriented with respect to salary so that i can pay my my dues like i can pay for myself i can go on vacation i can you know support my family whatever there's nothing wrong with that the problem is that we become overly outcome focused and the main thing is that we've become unintentionally outcome focused we've started to be controlled by outcomes this is where if you want to be an artist what i would recommend to you is that you don't try to become a best-selling author right or artist what you try to do is make the best book and that's a subtle but very important difference right so write the best goddamn book you can don't worry about becoming a best-selling author paradoxically it's the people who worry about becoming best-selling authors that have the hardest time becoming best-selling authors and it's the people who don't try to become best-selling authors and focus on writing the best goddamn book that they can that wind up as best-selling authors now you may have to make some adjustments and stuff based on like markets and stuff like that so i'm not i'm not saying you're ignoring all that stuff but generally speaking with artistic pursuits like the best games are going to come not out of like formulaic understanding of things but someone who's like i want to play a game where i can do this so like even elden ring is like i hope a great example where from software was like we want to make a dark souls game but we want it to be open world and that's our goal it's not we want to make the best selling game on steam that's not their goal maybe it is i don't know i mean i can't speak for them but in terms of people who do creative work it's like devote yourself to like the purity of your action man that is what makes human creativity so amazing right i don't know that like when michelangelo made the sculpture of david he was like i want a piece of artwork that will be appreciated for thousands of years i don't know that that was his goal what i imagine his goal is is like i want to make just a magnificent piece of artwork so devote yourself to the action and it's fine to be an artist just make the best art you can possibly make and then do the business stuff right like it's important to do that stuff but don't let that be your focus i mean you can it's just not what i would personally advocate for
