started so welcome to another healthy gamer GG stream my name is Olive kenoja just a reminder that although I'm a psychiatrist nothing we discuss on stream today is intended to be taken as medical advice everything is for educational or entertainment purposes only if y'all have a personal concern or question please go see a licensed professional and hopefully you all will understand the importance of that at the end of today's lecture So today we're doing a deep dive into addiction and I'll talk about that a little bit more in a few seconds when I sort of do the intro to the lecture um but basically today is sort of like my take on how a lay person should understand addiction and I think part of the problem that we have is that oftentimes when we teach stuff about addictions we're teaching things from a clinician's perspective so here are the different things that we understand about addictions and like here are the risk factors and all that kind of stuff but the risk factors for addiction either apply to you or don't apply to you right and and so it's kind of like if you're in a high risk situation for addiction like what do you do about that so today's lecture is going to be a little bit different because it's sort of you know here if I was addicted to something and I have been addicted to things in the past here are the here are the things that I would have wanted to know like if I could go back and give 15 year olds self myself from when I was a 15 year old if I could try to explain if I just had one hour or 75 minutes with 15 year old me this is what I would explain it's not a whole lot of detailed like clinical stuff there's going to be a lot of Neuroscience and a fair amount of clinical stuff but it's not about like being complete we're not going to talk about particular substances like this is how you get addicted to this we're going to talk about in general why do human beings get addicted to things like how does that work so this is part of our mental health uh May initiative so here at HG we may is mental health awareness month and we've been sort of doing stuff pretty significant for mental health May for several years now it's kind of like a really busy month for us it's a month where we do our best to help the people in our community who need it the most we try to help Humanity in May a lot of people focus on Mental Health Awareness which is cool one of the things that we find though is that awareness is like sometimes not enough right you actually have to help people like get to where they go they need to go so we are trying to do the most high impact stuff that we can this month to try to help you all the most so if you ignore us the other 11 months of the year that's totally fine but I strongly recommend that you check out the stuff that we do this month because we have tried to select the things because so many people's eyes are on us at this moment we've tried to select the things that we believe will help you the most and so doing a deep dive into addiction is really a good example of that we did a deep dive into trauma last Friday and we've gotten an immense amount of positive feedback around that so we also will try to pick certain topics that we think people don't that people are sort of misunderstanding so we had a YouTube video about this is why you really feel intimidated so for example like a lot of people struggle with feeling intimidated sometimes they don't even really realize that that's what they're feeling and then we don't quite understand like the psychological or Neuroscience mechanisms of why we feel intimidated and in feeling intimidated prevents us from doing so many different things in life right so if I feel like these people are better than me or better looking than me or more popular than me or more entertaining than me then I won't go do something like go to a party or apply for a promotion or go to happy hour after work so feeling intimidated leads to avoidance and avoidance leads to so many of our problems and that's where like so kind of so we're trying to do is we're trying to pick these issues that people are really struggling with that there may not be a diagnosis for right and that's what really we're really about at HG is not providing Clinical Services it's that there's all kinds of stuff that you can struggle with with your mind in your life that aren't necessarily clinical in nature but we still can use all of our research and understanding in like even some of the teachings of the Buddha to sort of package that up and help you all overcome a discrete problem and so feel free to check out that video it's something that I was really excited to make like I thought it was kind of a cool concept um and so that's on our our YouTube channel okay a couple of other things so in general uh you know we have a lot of other product Services um community events things like that which all are more than welcome to check out I understand that um like Ruthie our CEO did uh with one of uh one of her colleagues did a really awesome Discord event yesterday I think around like entrepreneurship or relationships or something like all of the above I'm not quite sure um so you know we have lots of different things where if you y'all are interested in stuff like that right so we don't like stream entrepreneurship uh um content but where you know three four years ago we started out with a team of one which was yours truly and now we have a team of over 120 people in over 12 countries across the world we help we've had like coaching clients we've had over 12 000 coaching clients in 119 countries and our outcomes are pretty good we're going back to the American Psychiatric association today because of some of the work that we've done I mean this this month because some of the work that we've done um so we've got kind of good outcomes around that sort of stuff and where we've got papers that are being reviewed for publication all that good stuff and so feel free to check out our coaching program I think we're full at the moment but you can definitely get added to the wait list and and you know new spots open up every day so don't let that deter you and if you all are interested in more comprehensive content we've got um some stuff coming out for you all hopefully by the end of the month so stay tuned for that and if y'all want more detailed information on like Dr K's perspective on meditation like how do I understand meditation how do I find the right meditation check out Dr K's guide to meditation and then we also have guides on ADHD and doing stuff so if you want to do a deep dive into motivation and behavioral change check out the guide to ADHD because it has a big section on that majority of it is actually about that and then we also have guides on depression and anxiety okay um so yeah questions before we get can one overcome addiction by himself what a great question we'll get into that Okay so here's how I know how to start the lecture and how I know whether I should take a question so when you all start asking questions that are a part of what we're going to cover today um that's when I know we should start the lecture okay so I'm gonna just answer answer Jason's question real quick so what would it take to get the phase connect girls on here I'm not sure who they are um but we actually are going to have a video coming out around a about Ai and therapy hopefully within the next week or so so it's in post-production okay okay let's talk about addiction so what we're going to talk about today is addiction but it addiction from sort of a subjective perspective so there's a lot of information we have on addiction there's a lot of good research there's a lot of good clinical trials there's a lot of good Neuroscience studies things like that but the problem is that most of the resources I've seen on addiction are kind of coming from a clinical perspective so usually the resources on on addiction are here's what we know from like research and we're going to try to explain all of that stuff to you so most of the resources on addiction will talk about okay what are the diagnostic criteria for an addiction this lecture is going to be different this lecture is essentially out of all the work that I've done on addiction if I had one hour or 75 minutes with myself at the age of 15 what would I teach myself how would I explain to a 15 year old kid or 18 year old kid or 21 year old kid this is how addiction works we have to understand why we get addicted to things and this is where a lot of people will get caught up in all kinds of different substances or kinds of addictions like are we going to talk about internet addiction or binge eating or cocaine addiction or alcohol use or marijuana or whatever and those are all important conversations but the key thing is that if you are struggling with something you need to understand the underlying mechanisms that allow a human being and brain to get addicted to a substance on a fundamental level what is going on and once you understand the underlying mechanisms what you will discover is that if you're trying to ask how do I overcome an addiction all of the answers will be at your fingertips why because you understand the nature of the thing you understand exactly what's going on so if I'm playing a video game and I lose a particular match and I go back and I watch a replay if I understand the underlying mechanisms of how do you win at a game and how do you lose in a game then I can understand okay what are all the things that I need to do differently do I need to practice my aiming do I need to practice my coordination with my team is our strategy wrong or our tactics wrong or is our Loadout wrong right so it how do you win a game is like it depends on what's wrong and so once we understand all of the underlying mechanisms My Hope Is that you all will understand from kind of a start to finish perspective how to approach your addiction or someone else's and so let me give you all a quick overview so we're going to start with Neuroscience okay then we're going to go into and I hate to say this but we have to do neuroscience and Neuroscience can be very intimidating I'm gonna do my best to simplify it for y'all then what we're going to do is understand how an addiction develops and you may ask yourself wait why wouldn't we start with how an addiction develops it's because once you understand the Neuroscience everything about how an addiction develops will become easier to understand so then we're going to go into things like risk factors and environment and all that kind of stuff because we understand that the development of an addiction has to do with the circuitry in your brain and if we understand that then we'll understand how for example abuse in childhood leads to addiction once we understand that we're going to look at sort of a snapshot of the addictive personality so once we understand developmental forces in Neuroscience we end up with a person who has built a particular way and so we're going to take a slice of that person and we're going to try to understand okay what is this thing called an addictive personality what's going on here and then what we're going to do is go to Solutions and this is the one lecture that I'm going to do where I think like Solutions are actually going to be 50 of the lecture but the reason that Solutions are not 50 of the lecture is not because there's like 15 15 tips to overcome addiction that's not what we're talking about once you understand the underlying mechanisms you will understand that there are so many different dimensions that you can tackle an addiction in your life and in my clinical experience and I've done a fair amount of work in addiction psychiatry it's understanding how addiction affects every dimension of your life that actually leads to the best results so for some people they may start to think oh this is overwhelming because I have to do so much you don't have to do so much this is actually good news because if you're struggling and you did not realize that there are 50 things that you can do you can start doing any of those things and make progress so while the instinctive reaction may be to be overwhelmed I actually get very very very optimistic when I have a patient who comes in and who does none of these things what terrifies me is when I have a patient who is doing everything right and they are still addicted there's a lot of low hanging fruit okay so let's get started so let's start with this what is an addiction okay so generally speaking the way that we Define an addiction is that it is engagement of a behavior despite negative consequences okay so in a nutshell you keep doing something even though it's a bad idea that's kind of the definition of an addiction so generally speaking this results in some kind of impairment of function so a big question that people have is how do I know if I'm addicted right because you can like drink alcohol or use marijuana and maybe you're addicted maybe you're not how do you know and the question is is it impairing your function in some way is it negatively impacting your physical health is it negatively impacting your mental health is it negatively impacting your professional success your academic success your relationships and if you are engaging in a behavior that is causing problems in these dimensions then that's the nutshell of what an addiction is there's lots of clinical diagnostic criteria and stuff but this is where remember the goal of this is to like help you understand okay are you addicted or not okay now we're going to dive straight into Neuroscience okay so the first thing to understand is that addictions have discrete phases so when I use an addictive substance there is the first phase of kind of like enjoyment okay so this is where in the first phase when I start using a substance or playing a video game or something like that like it's fun makes me feel better okay and then what starts to happen is as we use the substance more and more we enter this phase of habituation so at this point we're kind of like it doesn't really Elevate us in a lot of ways so at the very beginning there are certain circuits that are involved here like dopamine and the nucleus accumbens we'll get into more detail of this later but this is kind of like the first time you do something there's no habit circuitry involved right it's just kind of like I'm gonna do this thing and it's fun and like it starts and it ends there's no long-term changes or adaptations it's one stimulus one response end of story then what happens is we start to habituate to it so as we get a stimulus in our brain over extended periods of time our brain starts to adapt and then we start recruiting habit circuitry and then the third stage of an addiction is when we're screwed okay in a nutshell and you may say okay Dr K what do you mean by screwed so at some point we get to the point where our brain is so used to this thing where over here it's creating let's say here's our Baseline it's creating a positive move from our Baseline and our habituation use of this substance kind of keeps us here and then when we get to the screwed phase our Baseline actually moves down here and now what happens is we need the substance to feel normal does this make sense like we kind of get used to it and now what happens is our Baseline experience is dysmorphia I mean sorry dysphoria okay so this is the point at which we can't function normally without the substance it's not giving us anything positive it is taking away the negative in our Baseline is negative okay this one we're screwed this one we're really addicted at this point we can't stop and why can't we stop it's because our Baseline is down here so in order to even be functional in order to go throughout your day and be able to work and hang out with other people and not be stuck in your head and not be like filled with like anxiety and and withdrawal and all this kind of crap we need the substance at this point we become dependent with me okay now we have to talk about a couple of different neuroscientific mechanisms and and a couple of different neuroscientific systems and then we're going to get to parts of the brain so the first thing that we have to talk about is tolerance so imagine that I have a let's say I have my phone which has a MP3 player and then I have a set of speakers now I want so in my phone I've got volume I have a thing okay and then in my speakers I have a volume dial and then over here I have an output dial or this is the actual stuff that I hear okay so let's say that this is too loud this is kind of the volume that I want and this is too quiet let's say okay and so let's say that this is I'm going to sign a number 15 over here so I like my volume at 15. so what can I do so if I have let's say a volume of 3 over here then if if it's quiet on my phone what I'm going to do is increase the volume to a 5 over here and so 3 times 5 equals 15. conversely if I have if I jack up the volume to 15 on my phone then I'm going to turn down the volume on my speakers to still get 15. does that make sense so I've got two things I've got a signal and I've got a receiver and I have to modify those two things to keep stuff in the middle range this is the goal so what happens when we have an addiction let's say I've got three molecules of dopamine and then I have five dopamine receptors and the dopamine signal that I'm looking for is 15. okay this is like what feels good this is how I enjoy myself I get a 15. so I've got a 5 over here I've got a 3 over here works great now one day I decide to use marijuana okay and then what marijuana does is I'm going to add marijuana artificially ads let's say two more and if I use it once it's no big deal so I get a 5 times 5 equals 25 holy crap I'm having so much fun this is more fun than Baseline but our brain is smart if I get five if I add two from marijuana very very frequently our brain is like hold on this is like too high so then what it ends up doing is it down regulates our receptors it literally takes the receptor off of the cell membrane and now we've gone down to three and so now what we see is that I have a 5 over here and a 3 over here for a 15. actually this marijuana is not a great example of this let's assume that this is alcohol okay a better example slight neurochemistry difference so now we've got a problem though because in this new system where we use a substance regularly our brain adapts to it this works for caffeine too by the way okay so now let me ask you all a question if I don't use alcohol I've down regulated my receptors and now I only have the regular stimulus what signal do I get nine this leads to dysphoria withdrawal okay and now what's happened and this is the habituation process by the way this this x right here is exactly what an habituation is and now once we reach this point now we've become screwed now you may Wonder okay and so we'll we start to see a couple of things so one is that the risk of addiction increases with the regularity of use the more often you use it the more likely you are to become addicted second thing that we know about addiction is that the size of the stimulus that you provide correlates with the level of addiction so what happens for these people now I I need this is a baseline okay so if I add two more now I'm at five and then I get to 15. but if I ever want to get back to the 25 because that was fun right when I get high I'm not looking to be Baseline I'm looking to have a good time so how do we get to 25 well we've got a you know increase to about eight or nine so now what we need to do is get up to nine so we're going to add one two so one two three four five six seven eight nine and so nine times three is twenty seven great and so if I start to use nine a lot what's going to happen oh this is too high we need to get down to 15. so we're going to knock one of these out right then we're down to two and now even though I'm using nine all the time what I end up with is 18. well this is back to normal and now if I stop using 9 if I go back down to five now five times two is only ten so now I can't use less I need to use more this is tolerance we must understand this principle okay next thing to understand so there are a couple of like interesting tidbits that come out of this so in my experience anytime I if people space out their usage by a minimum of four days this is sort of anecdotal okay there's some Neuroscience to support this then the likelihood of their that they're addicted is very low if people are using daily likelihood of addiction is very high okay so when people are saying how much is too much depends on the substance there's a lot of individual neurochemistry but I'd say kind of at a minimum it needs to be four days apart and generally speaking looking at drug half-lives and things like that ideally closer to a week okay questions uh are you all lost hold on a second do you all understand this or no okay I'm gonna keep going then okay so now the next thing that we need to understand is that when most people talk about addiction they focus on dopamine so this absolutely happens with dopamine in the nucleus accumbens so as we acclimatize to dopamine this also causes other problems like once we have a low level of dopamine receptors the problem is that non-drug activities feel less fun because if we look at like the signal from a book let's say a book is a three and then let's say something like going for a walk is a two or listening to music is a three so then what happens with people who get addicted is their receptors are down regulated and things that are otherwise would be enjoyable are no longer enjoyable enough and this leads to something called anhedonia or the inability to enjoy activities that are otherwise would be fun now this also creates a cycle because now the only way that I can have a good time we see this a lot in gaming especially is that I have to play games because the dopamine stimulation from books just isn't good enough so I need High adrenaline stuff but there's another really important circuit that we need to talk about but let's finish talking about dopamine so there's a couple of other things that we need to understand about dopamine in the nucleus accumbens okay I'm actually just going to talk nope Jesus let's lock that huh okay let's go so I'm going to just talk about this okay so why does our brain have a nucleus accumbens so let's go back from an evolutionary standpoint as living organisms we engage in different kinds of behavior our brain needs a way to reinforce some behaviors and not reinforce other behaviors okay our brain essentially needs to learn so like let's say a million years ago where some kind of primordial organism and we've got like two things that we can eat we've got like a potato and we've got a cooked potato and so if I take a bite of the regular potato and I take a bite of the cooked potato one of them is going to taste better and so our brain needs some way to like understand which of these two behaviors is better and that circuit is dopamine in the nucleus accumbens so when we do something that is rewarding to us and helps our survival we will release dopamine in the subjective experience of that as pleasurable so generally speaking the things that improve our chances of survival are the things that give us pleasure why does that stuff give us pleasure it's because the way that we're coded is that if this thing helps me survive I'm going to make the organism feel pleasure and if I make the organism feel pleasure it will learn to do that behavior again so pleasure and learning are tied together very interesting thing and very important to understand that's why we have both of these things happen in the nucleus accumbens so now the question becomes why are certain substances addictive and other substances are not addictive human beings don't get addicted to catnip we don't get addicted to dirt we don't get addicted to ice so the reason that certain substances are addictive is because from a chemical standpoint we have all this circuitry mapped out and the circuitry is designed to reinforce the right behaviors so why is orgasm and sex so enjoyable it's because it's required for the propagation of the species right so imagine two sets of organisms one that had no pleasure from sex and one that had a ton of pleasure from sex which ones do you think would actually like continue to survive right the ones that enjoy the sex so now what's happened in our current Society is we we have figured out that there are some plants out there right there's like millions and millions of plants and some of them have compounds that by coincidence activate this circuitry but now things are really confusing because when they activate the dopaminergic circuitry what are we learning because remember we're learning something generally speaking though we're supposed to be learning things that help us survive this is why the behavior becomes uncontrollable because what we're doing is we're learning our brain is like we need this thing this is helping us survive so we learn and this is why like from a conscious level and remember this is in the nucleus accumbens it's in a primitive part of the brain that like animals have so then what happens in addiction is from a cortical perspective your awareness or your intelligence recognizes that this is a problem logically you can look at it and it's a problem but you can't control the behavior why is that it's because you're learning circuitry is like we need this this is what helps us survive the very mechanisms that have allowed human beings to evolve and survive not just human beings monkeys crocodiles fish the very mechanisms that have allowed living organisms to move towards the right behaviors are the same things that drugs hijack and so now all of that primitive mechanism is telling you to use use use it has nothing to do with like conscious thinking or anything like that because now your brain is learned this is what I need and think about when you learn stuff you can't like overcome it right so once I learn how to walk like I can't just start it's like stop walking or start walking a different way or once I learn how to speak in a particular language or once I learn how to use particular words it's really hard to like unlearn stuff so our behaviors are shaped by our learning circuitry I know it sounds really really simple but like do you all get that because I don't think most people really understand that because what it does is it hijacks your learning circuitry and then you learn how to do stuff and then you do the behavior automatically because your brain has learned it okay so that's the dopaminergic circuitry there is another circuit that we need to talk about which is also affected by addiction this is no joke the Kappa circuitry of the brain okay so we have these things called Kappa receptors and Kappa receptors also get adjusted when we use substances Kappa receptors are sensitive to stress okay so what what happens is when we are in high stress periods like our stress molecules like cortisol and more specifically CRF so it's not really cortisol it's CRF it's a cortisol precursor activate something called the Kappa receptor and so the Kappa receptor is what detects stress when we're stressed Kappa receptors turn on Okay so the really interesting thing is that when we use substances of abuse they up regulate Kappa receptors so remember that dopamine is getting down regulated are sensitive we're becoming numb to dopamine we are building tolerance to dopamine but when it comes to the Kappa receptor We are Becoming sensitive to stress now let's understand why that is now let's say I'm stressed out oh no there's so much stress and then I start using drugs what happens to my stress my stress decreases so the more that I use drugs we're going to go back to this for a second time to do maths chat so let's say I have three molecules of stress and I have five Kappa receptors and when I use drugs it reduces my stress if I use drugs regularly my body's like hold on a second we need to get to 15 brah we only have one so what is our body going to do add a bunch of Kappa receptors because we got to get to 15. and now let's say that we have a normal amount of stress holy crap now if I have 15 Kappa receptors and I have three stress molecules I'm going to end up with a 45 stress level and now I'm going to feel so stressed out y'all get this is the exact exact opposite but same principle of dopamine now why is this important this is important because when people are stressed out they will use drugs right because how do you modulate the signal what have you learned about how do you control that stress if my stress is 45 and I'm hypersensitive to stress what can I do to make two of those stress molecules go away I can get high so now we understand a really really really important part of overcoming addiction it is exponentially more difficult to overcome addiction when we are in a stressful environment this also explains why we relapse when we're stressed out what is the connection between stress and this it is literally that and let's understand this okay so this circuitry the CRF circuitry is the same circuitry that activates if you lose a [ __ ] limb so if I'm in a car accident and my leg gets knocked off heaven forbid that doesn't happen and I am bleeding out and I am dying CRF skyrockets I get a c i get 15 CRF molecules I have five Kappa receptors and I get a stress signal of 45. and so my body is like holy [ __ ] son you are dying do whatever you can in that moment if my brain had learned some way to reattach my leg and stop bleeding out it would absolutely do that do y'all get that if it had any behavior that it could to make that stress go away it would make it go away this is the circuitry that is involved with addiction it is our survival circuitry and so when we get stressed out this is what our body thinks and our body is like holy [ __ ] son this is terrible we gotta fix this no matter what which is why we use it's not just dopamine it is survival mechanisms which have for millions of years have literally kept you alive which are now like going haywire they're like do whatever you can to make this go away because we are dying this is the same circuitry that interprets the signals for I am literally dying and withdrawal are like the same and if you talk to people who go through withdrawal it feels like they're dying there's all kinds of physiologic signals and stuff there too right but this is really important to understand because this is also why stress leads to relapse and we'll get to this more in a couple minutes but now the important thing to understand is with the Kappa circuitry if you're in a stressful situation it is very hard to quit your addiction and so dealing with your stressful situation and managing stress is one of the most foundational things at overcoming addiction and the biggest mistake that people make in overcoming addiction is you try to overcome that Addiction in a vacuum and you don't address the other parts of your life and if the situation created the addiction you can't overcome the addiction in the same situation I mean you can theoretically but it's incredibly hard okay now let's talk about how addiction develops okay I'm going to skip some of the Neuroscience we'll we'll do it a little bit more um we'll we'll do some come back to it okay so let's talk about the development of an addiction so human beings need three things growing up they need nutrition they need physical security and they need emotional security they need emotional support physical safety and nutrition so we have to understand something about the way that human beings develop so the first thing to understand about human development is when we are growing up we are not making new neurons we are pruning neurons so when we're born we actually have the most number of neurons that we'll ever have in our life in fact we have the most number of neurons we'll ever have in our life even prior to birth so the process of growing up is not learn the process of learning is not making new things it's actually getting rid of connections okay so this becomes really important because there are a lot of things that will adjust which neurons we get rid of and I'll give you all a simple example of this okay now that we understand the Kappa system If I Grow Up in an environment that is stressful will I prune my stress sensitive neurons absolutely not because we require these neurons in order to survive and function in this system if I grow up in an environment of security our brain is like oh all this [ __ ] that makes us panic and needs us to survive in these stress systems that keep us awake at night and like you know make danger feel more real we don't need this stuff because we're not using it if your brain doesn't use something you lose it this is why we forget languages this is why we start sucking at video games if we stop playing them doesn't quite explain why we suck at video games even if we're grinding it up so if you grow up in a secure environment you will literally cut away your stress response system because you don't need it and then what happens is as you go through normal life you will experience less stress there are some human beings out there who are like kind of magical because they're like wow they like handle things so well this is such a [ __ ] show and they're resilient and they're confident in themselves that's because they've pruned away half of their stress circuitry right you're kind of weird so if you look at studies of mothers with depression the CRF remember which is the stress signal in the brain and the Kappa system is up regulated in children as young as one year old a mom with depression will have a child who's one year old who is hypersensitive to stress so now let's understand how does adverse childhood experiences like growing up in a traumatic household or whatever neglectful household parent and this is where we get to all the risk factors right there's a lot of data about this is a risk factor this is a risk factor this is a risk factor it's really simple you don't have to study all those risk factors all you need to do is understand what is it what's the mechanism through which these risk factors matter and the one mechanism that matters is does this result in a survival benefit to having a stress sensitive brain and if the answer that question is yes it's a risk factor for addiction done finished so if I grow up with a parent who's physically abusive does my brain need to be able to handle stress yes check abuse leads to risk of depression I mean it's a risk of addiction why does it lead to risk of addiction because of the Kappa system because what happens is since our Kappa system is so upregulated I need some sort of artificial substance to down regulate the signal because my brain is so [ __ ] sensitive why is it sensitive because it needed to be sensitive in order for me to not get beat you'll get this okay I see a question will I ever be okay 100 yes you will be why because we can prune neurons later this is beautiful I know it sounds like oh my God am I screwed no you just need to prune those neurons now easier to prune to neuron than it is to build a neuron neurogenesis is very difficult this is why there's a lot of Hope don't give up hope okay so oftentimes what we see is stressful situations will basically increase our risk of addiction now let's talk about if we grow up in all these situations and let's just go through a couple of other points okay the first is that people are like okay like what about genetics so our current understanding of addiction is that it is a genetic vulnerability plus environment okay it like you can have someone who's an alcoholic who has a child who's not an alcoholic and now hopefully like I don't need to explain to you why it is not just genetics because you all understand the Kappa system you understand the up regulation of the Kappa system when our brain is forming which exposes us to the genetic vulnerability everyone has the genetic vulnerability what determines or not everyone let's say 50 people have the genetic vulnerability why is it that only 10 percent of them get addicted the reason is because some of them grew up in the kind of environment that primed their Kappa system and made them prone to addiction what this also means is that even if you were genetically screwed changing your environment can change the addiction very important to understand okay so next thing if we look at fundamentally so if we have this negative environment right and our brain grows up in a certain way what do we end up as okay what we end up as is something that people will call kind of like this addictive personality so some people will get addicted to one substance some people will get addicted to all kinds of things so let's understand this concept of addictive personality so addiction is about your relationship to the thing the reason we get addicted is because the thing does more things for you than it does for the average person this is why addiction forms so what do I mean by that so last time I checked I don't have an alcohol use disorder so I'm not addicted to alcohol which means that I can have a couple drinks arguably even have a good time and only enjoy it and then tomorrow I'm totally fine because all the alcohol does for me is like it's some kind of arguable enjoyment I don't even really enjoy it for some people it does other things so for some people it helps us regulate our emotions so when I need like regulation of my emotions I will meditate or I will go in like get a hug from my kid or whatever right there are other ways that I manage my emotions I feel pretty good I'm not trying to flex on you right so I'm just explaining so what what what happens is if I have ways to get my needs met then I don't need the addiction it becomes an addiction when the only way that I can get my need met or the primary way in which I get that need met is going to be through the substance so if my life becomes really really stressful and hugs for my children don't cut it anymore then I will need a substance to make myself feel better okay so what ends up happening is drugs can start substituting and fulfilling other kinds of needs and generally speaking what we see in people who are addicted is that the fundamental problem is that I am not able to manage myself so I require the drug to do all kinds of like internal management and and what I I that may not make a whole lot of sense so let me explain so if I grow up in a traumatic situation and I feel bad what is my solution to feeling bad it's not to meditate it's to change my behavior and react to my environment in a particular way right so if I have an abusive parent the more invisible I become the more safe I will feel so if you think about that child what does the child learn the child learns that if there's a problem in here where is the solution the solution is out there once a child learns this they this is the birth of an addictive personality because now the solution to problems in here comes from the outside so if I feel unloved let me go and have sex if I feel unhappy let me go get high and we'll even see the addictive personality in like spirituality there's some people who are spiritual addicts I don't I don't know like I want to find like connection with the Divine so I'm going to go to this Retreat and then I'm going to go to this Retreat and then I'm going to go to this Retreat I'm going to go to this Retreat I'm gonna do this I'm going to do this I'm going to do this I'm gonna feel connected I'm gonna feel connected I'm gonna feel connected why the [ __ ] are you going traveling all over the world to feel connected to yourself you're right here so fundamental problem that happens in the addictive personality is that human beings learn that the way to manage and relate to this crap over here has to do with outside so another thing that we see in the addictive personality is failure of an independent identity the development of an independent identity so what that sort of means is that people get Amalgamated with their caregivers so whether I feel good about myself depends on how this other person treats me that my emotions become their emotions and why does that happen it's because it has to happen for survival if I'm happy and my abuse of parent is pissed off I better not be happy so I have to become one with them when they become pissed I need to be tuned into that I can't be happy anymore so we lose sight of ourself and now we're going to go back to Neuroscience okay so hopefully now the Neuroscience will make sense so what are the deficits that we see in addiction one thing that we see nope foreign we see deficits in the insula the insula is responsible for introspection and awareness of the self so what happens how does this result in addiction so if I don't know so remember that the way I'm managing my emotions is through substances but if I am unaware of my emotions because I have been colorblinded to my emotions based on the relationship of my stressful upbringing now what happens is I'll tell y'all what an insular deficit addicts sound like Doc I was doing good for six weeks and then I don't know what happened I just relapsed people don't just relapse there's always a reason but it is the internal blindness from the problems in the insula that result in a deficit in introspection which results in an unawareness of my emotions and then as my emotions escalate how does how have I learned because I have an addiction addictive personality that how do I deal with negative emotions I turn to the outside and why do I turn to the outside it's because I don't even know what's going on under the hood how am I supposed to fix what's under the hood if I I'm colorblind to what's under the hood it's the only option that I have is drugs y'all with me so we see insular deficits for people who have addictions okay let's talk about a couple of other things that happen so our brain is smart and it has this region of our let me just make sure I want to do this in this okay so let's talk about the PFC in frontal lobes so our brain is smart there's a concept called incentive salience and so what our brain does is figures out that not only is there the drug there's the stuff associated with the drug that then gets me primed for the enjoyment okay so for example this is just how our brain works so anytime there is something that is rewarding our brain figures out okay what are the associated stimuli so for example if I go to a restaurant and I hear everyone's having a good time I see some people are at the bar having margaritas I start to anticipate the enjoyment of the food and it makes me hungry so once you step into a restaurant you're gonna feel hungrier why is that it's because our brain does this really simple thing where it Associates stimuli with like the reward so even though I'm not eating yet the associated stimuli with eating will make me hungrier and will actually cause a release of dopamine even then which causes me to Crave even more so when we start to use drugs what happens is or other addictive substances is our frontal lobes get conditioned through incentive salience and then what happens is we start to get cravings from Associated stimuli so what does this mean this means if I'm addicted to alcohol and I go to a barbecue even going to the barbecue is going to make me want to drink alcohol think about when you enjoy playing video games when is when is the most hype right because the actual game sucks because your teammates are [ __ ] but boy it's like yeah like let's party up and let's cue let's go baby let's go this game is going to be epic we're gonna love it it's gonna be great you with me so then what happens is we start to associate all of these stimuli and then once because our brain is able to tie these things together it's like pavlovian conditioning and then even the associated stuff will trigger the behavior so if for example I'm addicted to video games and I watch things or I subscribe to a subreddit or whatever where people are posting clips of playing and things like that if I watch Twitch stream or YouTube stream or whatever all the associated behaviors will trigger the cravings okay that's mediated by our frontal lobes the other thing that we tend to find is that people who are addicted to things have impulsivity so they don't really think things through and they don't really like think about the consequences of their actions so when people are addicted to stuff like when I queue up for one game right or in my case it's like playing a turn-based strategy game like let's say something like SIV or Stellaris or I'm playing no man's Sky nowadays and like you know or Total War Warhammer like you don't load up Total War Warhammer for like one turn right it's like one turn becomes 15 becomes 50 becomes 500. and so what happens in in people is that we start to like we don't think about the consequences of our actions this is also mediated to certain degree by the frontal lobes okay so we need to do and then what happens is if we have an Impulse which also relates to our lack of awareness we don't really know where the impulse is coming from we'll engage in the behavior so ah [ __ ] it let me just load it up you also want to understand impulsivity and frontal lobe deficits just look at your phone and what I mean by that is pay attention to how quickly you open up your phone without being aware of it at all before you even realize it you'll open up your phone and you'll like be browsing something okay it's another deficit next thing that we're going to talk about so this is also where there's a deficit in an inhibitory control okay there are other parts of the brain like um reward and consequence prediction we are already kind of talked about this a little bit are impaired okay so what this sort of means is we don't really think about the consequences of our actions when we use drugs or addictive substances we assume that everything is going to be okay like anytime you get you know I had patients who are addicted to heroin they're not like thinking like oh yeah this is going to absolutely ruin my life tomorrow I only have 50 bucks left I'm homeless I'm going to use all this money today and then unless I find 50 more dollars tomorrow which is hard to find I'm going to go through terrible withdrawals and I'm gonna feel awful and I'm going to feel like I'm dying they don't think like that they're just like I've got 50 bucks now tomorrow is tomorrow okay another deficit the last thing that we're going to talk about is my favorite new part of the brain so how do you all imagine we pronounce this can you all read this what do y'all think how do you read this word let's realize that I can't actually hear audio so okay that's silly okay so this is when when you get a you know lecture that's someone who's trying to give lectures in person you move them to the internet I can't actually hear you all at all okay so this is the Avenue okay the habanula I think the habandula is the most interesting part of the brain that we almost know nothing about or like most people don't aren't aware of the habanula but the habanula is like critical so the first thing is the habanula is called the stock of the pineal gland okay so for those of you that know the pineal gland produces melatonin but in meditative Traditions the pineal gland is really important it's the physical correlate of the third eye some autopsies done in the 50s and 60s found that lifelong meditators had engorged pineal glands so you take these monks that like meditate all day and their pineal glands are huge the pineal gland is somehow associated with like spirituality and generally speaking for most human beings the pineal gland shrinks over the course of your life unless you meditate a lot in which in case it's engorged so the habanula is responsible for a couple of things it's responsible for anti-reward so what that sort of means is that when when we think about things that we will dislike the habanula is involved so the habanula like we think about you know dopamine is like when we like something the nucleus accumbens and dopamine activates when we dislike something the habanula activates the habanula is also where we get expectation from so for example like right now everyone's talking about how tears of the kingdom is such a great game so if I hear lots of great reviews about a movie or video game or something like that I form an expectation if I form an expectation my enjoyment of the thing is likely to be lower so what part of the brain governs this principle it is the habanula okay the last thing that the habanula does is since it creates expectations the habanola does something really interesting it gate keeps dopamine release so just think about that for a second because now this should make sense so the habanable habanula inhibits dopamine and what does that mean let's think about this if I have an expectation of something and the expectation is really high when I actually go and do that thing it is less enjoyable if it's less enjoyable that means there's less dopamine but what is the connection between expectation and less dopamine it is the habanula so in order for you to get a normal or a high dopamine response you have to miscalc it's kind of this is where things get a little bit confusing but you essentially need to like miscalculate your expectation this is something called a positive let me think about positive error prediction reward calculation so basically what this means and I'll I'll explain it hopefully a little bit better in a second so first thing is that as soon as we have an expectation it inhibits dopamine that's why it's less fun so in order to bypass that gatekeeping what you have to do is have an unexpected Joy does that make sense because the second I have an expectation I'm going to gatekeep and I'm going to inhibit dopamine release but if my experience is unexpectedly good I.E the habanula did not predict it then you get normal dopamine okay now let's understand this this also kind of explains why oh like I went to work and I was not expecting to have a really good time and since I had a really good time man that was so much fun so lack of expectations lead to enjoyment expectations lead to less enjoyment by the way associated with the pineal gland I'm wondering does that have anything to do with monks and meditation really interesting right because what do like what all these like monks teach like what do we teach let go of expectation and enjoy will be yours they figured this out so a lot of our meditative Practices Act on the habanula by letting go of expectations and this is where even when you look at addiction why do we get addicted to stuff we don't get addicted to stuff because it's as fun it's it's not we don't get addicted to stuff because it's just as much fun every single time think about when you play a video game you play up one video so I play DotA right so like let's use mobas let's be fair half of the games are [ __ ] why on Earth do we keep playing because every once in a while there's that one epic game that you did not expect and it blew away your expectations outmaneuvered the habanula gave us this burst of dopamine that we never expected and holy [ __ ] that is so reinforcing that we're gonna do it again so when you talk to people who use drugs they're chasing that first high this is why they've called heroin chasing the dragon right because every time you get high it's not the same you want that first experience again you want that pre-expectation experience again you want that like epic game every single time you queue up but the more epic games you have the less epic they become the less enjoyable they become so you need more this is the cycle of addiction this is why addiction is a trap and it all comes down to the habanula we're looking for because think about the things that you're addicted to think about why you [ __ ] keep getting back with your ex such a train wreck because there was that one time man it was when it's good it's so good baby let's go son I know it's not always that good but it could be that good this time I know that 15 times it's been [ __ ] let's get back on that horse son let's she's texting me again um yeah let's go I'm feeling bad about myself let's text her I know it's a train like but remember remember back when it was good baby let's go back there I want that again all of that [ __ ] comes from the habanu y'all with me questions does that make sense I have no idea if I'm making sense or not I have never heard addictions taught in this way I've never seen addictions taught in this way so I have no idea if what I'm saying makes sense but do you all understand that's why we get addicted to stuff it's not because of what we expect it's because we are chasing the unexpected because when we first used that substance it was beyond our wildest dreams and if you all have used drugs you know exactly what I'm talking about that first time that you really got high it was like Wow there is a dimension of life that people who have never gotten high do not understand they're the normies out there and then if you use something like heroin or cocaine or meth you get this whole other you've unlocked some weird bonus realm of life and then your whole life is spent trying to get back to that bonus realm but the problem with our [ __ ] neuro circuitry is that the more that we use the further away from it we get and we're chasing it and chasing it and chasing it and it happens less and less and less and then we habituate to this right and then we enter enter the crap Zone remember there's the original use then there's the habituation then there's the word of the screwed phase we're now even normal life is no longer sufficient for us mediated by the habanula okay now I think that's neuroscience so let's explain let's go back to this idea of what makes us addicted okay so we're at one hour so we're gonna go for maybe 30 more minutes okay I'm gonna try to wrap up so what makes us addicted is our relationship to the thing and hopefully this makes sense now so what do you mean by the relationship to the thing for some people alcohol is just alcohol but for some of us it is the way that we manage our emotions it is the way that we connect to other people is the way that we feel normal it is the goal of life because man do I feel like I'm living so as we get addicted to stuff we start to run into different kinds of problems okay so [Music] let me just rest my voice for a second okay so as a result of some of this these problems in the insula and as a result of some of these problems with Kappa receptors we become hypersensitive to negative internal States and we are also blind to negative internal States so what does that do to someone it messes with their relationships okay so we also have like relationship problems because we don't independently develop in those traumatic situations and we become really reactive to the way to the to our circumstances and so what happens when you put all this stuff together is like you're not living your life life for someone who's addicted feels like if y'all ever played those games where you jump on a platform and the platform crumbles away and so you have to jump onto the next platform and jump onto the next platform because just to advance and survive there is no stability this is what life is like for someone who is addicted your whole life every day you get up and the ground is crumbling away and you've got to jump to something else you've got to jump to something else you've got to jump to something else there's no security there's no stability you can't be with yourself just sitting there by yourself is complete torture so this impacts our relationships we turn to other people not only our substances but we turn to other people to meet our needs and then the problem with being addicted is that you're actually kind of two people if you look at people who are addicted they have the part of us that is like oh my God things are crumbling and then there's the part of us that is actually jumping and Landing it over and over and over again so what you see in people who are addicted is that they're two people one is falling apart and one is crushing it right there are the times where you're high and there are the times that you're actually living life you've got these functional alcoholics that are going into work every day and they're crushing it right left and Center you've got people who you're in relationships with and on some days they get the good version of you where you're like let's go you know Dr Chad thundercock in the house and then other days they get that reactive person they get the terrified person they get the person who's the floor is crumbling underneath them and so the life of someone who's addicted is like some kind of weird ping pong between two states either everything is falling apart or things are going amazing and then what happens is like what do you need for things to go amazing you need the substance and so you avoid that part of yourself that is crumbling you avoid the negative emotion you avoid you react to your emotions and you seek things outside to fix you internally that can be relationships that can be stuff at work that can be drugs that can be whatever so the basic problem is that you are not comfortable with yourself so then what we end up seeing as you go through life like this there are other consequences that develop so we're just going to focus on one which is the development of Shame so as people use substances for longer periods of time the one emotion that tends to rack up is shame because the the cognitive parts of you remember your higher order brain functions your analysis is intact it's all these other parts of your brain like your expectation circuitry your learning circuitry you can't learn but you certainly know there's a problem and so then what happens is you start to realize like holy crap like I'm my IQ is good I'm talented there are things about me that are good but I keep screwing it up and so paradoxically what you see is the most devastating self-esteem in people with addictions but the more devastating the most devastating self-esteem are actually comes from the people who are the most capable because the more capable you are the more of a [ __ ] up you are if you don't reach your potential and that shame piles up over and over and over again and as the shame piles up remember we're emotionally reactive so what do we do to fix it all kinds of things out there as we do things out there as we react to those emotions and we use more drugs we engage in more unhealthy relationships our life moves in the wrong direction the more that our life moves in the wrong direction the more squandered potential we have the more shame we have and what is our antidote to shame get high then we're stuck with me so now how to fix it good news very fixable very very very very very fixable now I'm going to hit hit you all with a lot of stuff okay so what we're going to do to understand how to fix it is we're going to understand brain stuff we're going to understand medication we're going to understand Psychotherapy we're going to understand all the different deficits in the brain and things that you can do for each deficit in the brain we're going to understand relationship stuff we're going to understand identity stuff we're going to understand professional stuff we're going to understand spiritual stuff we're going to understand everything because real addiction healing requires work on each and every one of these levels and for those of you saying oh my God am I screwed you're not screwed at all there's a lot of low-hanging fruit you can get started in any one of these things in the same way that all this stuff weaves together it can be dominoes in the opposite direction so don't give up and if y'all think that I have a good understanding of this or if I've been able to explain something that makes sense to you have faith that I will be able to explain to you something that will give you a road out of this give me a chance chat we start with the brain okay we're going to start with medication so hopefully I've explained to y'all that this is kind of complicated there's environment stuff there's relationship stuff there's emotional reactivity stuff there's spiritual perspectives this is why medication is important because all that crap ultimately functions comes down to the brain right the stress systems and all this sort of crap the habanula the gatekeeping of dopamine all this sort of stuff the cool thing about medication is that medications short circuits all of this stuff just like bypasses a lot of it right because all this stuff has to happen through our brain so if we look at medications like Naltrexone so Naltrexone actually inhibits the positive effects this is a sign for inhibition positive effects of things like opiates and once we inhibit the positive effects what does that mean if we inhibit the positive effects we are shutting off the dopamine in the nucleus accumbens if we are shutting off the dopamine in the nucleus accumbens we are not reinforcing that behavior and there's also something else really think cool that we're doing we're not learning bad behavior y'all does this make sense because remember that the nucleus of Commons is responsible for Learning and this is why you keep on doing stupid [ __ ] because the part of your brain that is actually learning is separate from the part of your brain that does conscious analysis completely different circuits in the brain and so once we shut this thing off then like all the learning of the bad behavior also gets inhibited and it helps people okay so there are lots of medications that you can use the advantage of medications is that it just takes one of these pieces and it just short circuits them and then you get all kinds of Downstream effects we're not going to go too much into medications but they can absolutely help okay now let's talk about the different brain parts so remember we talked about the insula the insula is responsible for introspection the core of the problem is with no introspection this is an i we are unaware of emotions and if we're unaware of emotions and we are reactive in nature then what's going to happen is we're going to go about using drugs or whatever you're addicted to without understanding why you're just going to wake up one day and you're gonna be like yeah like yesterday I was able to resist but today I can't resist what's different who the [ __ ] knows maybe the phases of the Moon no it is because there is emotional unawareness so there are literally studies that will show that people who have addictions do not know what they are feeling so how do we fix this things like body scans or even things like psychotherapy these are both things and the goal here is emotional awareness we even have had our community event of right in the fields where we like trained people to increase their EQ we suspect also things like coaching will increase EQ we have a study on that that's running right now so we can't say that 100 but we're pretty confident so you may say what's the point of a body scan so here's something that you can do you want to strengthen your insula be aware of what you're feeling in your body chest tightness stuff in the throat pylo erection that means your hair is standing on end right when your hair stands up and so then what you can do because we're emotionally unaware right and the other reason that we're emotionally unaware is because we grew up in a situation where we were where is this didn't I write this somewhere I guess not oh yeah nope I didn't write it so we grew up in a situation where we were not emotionally taken care of so as a result of not being emotionally taken care of we don't know what our emotions feel like so we start with body scans what are you feeling in this moment start to release that tension so this level of meditation of body scan meditation can help us with insular Improvement when we do things like Psychotherapy and our therapist articulates our emotions for us it strengthens our insula once we understand what our emotions that we're feeling something then we can develop alternatives the problem with developing Alternatives and this is the problem that a lot of people run into they're like okay I'm addicted to stuff I should develop alternate Coke mechanisms it doesn't work you're just like okay maybe I'll install an app and start meditating why doesn't it work because you don't even know when you're supposed to use the coping mechanism you're kind of like developing this coping mechanism in a vacuum and instead like the coping mechanism needs to be used when you're using an emotion or feeling an emotion and as you use the coping mechanism when you're feeling an emotion that will reinforce the behavior and you'll actually learn how to cope in an alternate way teaching people to cope coping mechanisms when they're like on the beach doesn't do you any good you need to learn how to use coping mechanisms when you actually have something to cope with and if you are emotionally unaware you don't even know what you need to cope with okay so solution number one just the insulin we have so many other options okay so body scan meditation if you guys want one thing or therapy yeah okay remember the next thing we talked about incentive salience and what is incentive salience I may not have explained it very well this is basically conditioning and what does that mean that means that our brain learns that there are associated stimuli that get us ready they start to release dopamine and induce cravings so if I go to a restaurant I'm going to get hungry if there's candles and incense and Marvin Gaye playing you know and someone puts on their robe and wizard hat then I'm gonna get aroused okay so one of the things that we need to do if we want to conquer Cravings we have to get rid of the associated stimuli has nothing to do with like conquering actually conquering craving is not right it has to do with decoupling the stimulus from the craving so what we can do this is why when people are trying to get sober you know they stay away from bars so keep good company so if you have friends who get high every weekend don't hang out with those friends if you have a problem with drinking don't go to a bar don't go to barbecue think a little bit about what are the things that induce my cravings there are a couple of other things that you can do though so this is where a plan of avoidance is what you need and then some of you all may say but I can't avoid that stuff forever of course not but you don't need to avoid it forever you just need to avoid it long enough so that you can take care of all of this other stuff and when everything else is fixed you can go back into the environment and you will have no trouble whatsoever I used to be addicted to video games I love playing them now but it ain't no problem you can strengthen everything else it's an issue of what you want to tackle first so you need to think about what are your triggers and avoid the triggers that lead to craving something all may say but that's hard no problem we'll give you another option the other thing that you can do for conditioning is so that very practically that's like if you have a problem with games avoid twitch streams you know avoid subreddits all this kind of stuff okay just for a while uninstall the other thing that we can do is decouple the stimulus and the association this is my favorite so one way to decouple is to actually just get close but don't engage in it so this is where if we look at exposure and response prevention this is a very important principle from Psychiatric treatment where what we'll do is like if someone has a phobia they have an association let's say someone's claustrophobic so the thought of going into an elevator is associated with a physiologic response you're not even in the elevator but even thinking about the elevator causes some kind of response and so what we want to do is decouple that through continued exposure okay so every time we think about an elevator and nothing bad happens we actually our response decreases so if we spend a lot of time thinking about going into elevators eventually thinking about going into an elevator is not scary anymore doesn't trigger the physiologic response then the next step that we're going to do is we're going to go and look at the elevator we're not thinking about it now we're actually seeing the doors open and close and then now this will trigger response we're going to keep doing that until that's no longer scary then what we're going to do is we're going to step into the elevator and we're going to step out of the elevator without writing it we're just going to step in and step out that triggers a response we keep doing that until we become good with that and then what we're going to do is we're going to step into the elevator and we're going to close the doors but we're not going to go for a ride we're going to let the door start closing then we're going to hit the open door button so this is the principle of exposure and response prevention so this has to be done at some point with addictions and this is where I'll use an example I wouldn't recommend this for things like heroin right like you don't want to like walk up to you know like look at a bunch of needles and stuff but eventually you need to but in something like video games I'll give you all a simple example so if you're addicted to a video game sit in the lobby for 15 minutes and then quit just load up the lobby hang out for a little while and then quit do it intentionally set a timer on your phone sit down load up the game don't queue and then quit okay so those are the two ways that we deal with the conditioning aspect because there's all kinds of associations that are pushing us in a particular direction next thing we're going to talk about is the Kappa circuitry so remember that addictions activate our make our stress circuitry hypersensitive so what what that means is that if you are stressed out you are way more likely to use and this isn't just an emotional coping mechanism kind of thing that is there too what this means is that literally our stress circuitry is like hyperactive so this is why if we look at people who get sober they will go to places like rehab what is the value of rehab it's like a low stress environment right you've got all these super expensive rehabs like out on the beaches in Miami and stuff like that and you're like super chill and you get massages and you do yoga and all that kind of stuff and why is that it's because it's a low stress environment it's really hard to overcome addiction if you're in a stressful environment very practically what this also means is that you can do meditations that reduce your stress response and activate your parasympathetic nervous system so these are uh practices like triphasic breathing pranayam vilom extended exhalations will lower your stress levels and as they lower your stress levels they will make you able to resist addiction that has nothing to do with dopamine or or emotions or anything like that it is simply controlling that variable of stress you can also try to reduce the stress in the other dimensions of your life if you're trying to get rid of an addiction and this is where I know it sounds kind of weird but like as an addiction psychiatrist sometimes people come in and they'll be like okay I want to like get sober from alcohol and I'm like not yet and then they get really confused because they're like but isn't alcohol bad it's like yeah but you're not going to succeed until you put a couple of things in order in your life you have to have a low stress environment no don't have to but it makes it way easier and this is where if y'all are thinking oh my God it's so hard to do this stuff the whole point of this stuff is as you guys do these individual things getting sober will become easier and at the end it's almost effortless once you control for all of these variables which you can do a little bit at a time that's how people get sober they fix one little thing at a time instead of this big problem of overcoming my addiction with willpower that's a recipe for failure okay now let's keep going all right next okay let's talk about PFC impulsivity so one other thing that I would recommend that y'all do is practice restraining your impulses and there's one really good example of this that I think is just a really simple thing that you can do which is pray before eating so generally speaking we know that the brains of people who are addicted to stuff are more impulsive and so what we want to do is create tiny tiny situations where when we're about to enjoy something we delay that gratification for a little bit overcoming an addiction is not about conquering the addiction it is about writing out the impulsive urge that's what you have to do because the craving won't last forever you just have to out you have to procrastinate basically is what you need to do and so when I say pray before eating I don't care if you pray to a particular God or you don't have to pray to God you just need to stop before you eat and intentionally close your eyes you could give gratitude you can pray to God you can you know do some kind of invocation for Hope Just Close Your Eyes for a second and express some amount of gratitude hey I'm about to eat this food I'm grateful that I'm here right now I know my life is hard if you want to ask for help you can ask for help like you can ask for help from the Divine the universe whatever the key thing though is that I think one of the interesting thing that that's happened is if you look at a lot of spiritual practices or religious practices they help train our brain in particular ways like fasting praying before eating they train us to delay gratification another thing that you can do is before you play a game like we said sit in the lobby so anytime you queue up for something or you're playing a video game wait five minutes on the loading screen just wait five minutes and you're like that's boring that's the [ __ ] point learn how to train your impulsivity and you can do a five minute delay okay now next part of the brain that we're going to talk about have we talked about that yeah so there's another thing that there's another technique that we have a whole video about called urge surfing and that's to recognize that Cravings are by definition temporary and so all you need to do is write out the craving if you can control the impulsivity eventually the craving will go away okay so just write it out next thing that we're going to talk about is remember that there are prediction errors in addictions what does that mean that means that I don't understand the consequences of my actions I don't think about the consequences of my actions so there's a technique here called play the tape through archaic now ancient knowledge because we don't have tapes through to the end so anytime you're thinking about using play the tape through if I use today what's going to happen tonight what's going to happen tomorrow how will I feel tomorrow what will work be like what will studying be like what will my relationships be like will I cook for myself will I eat out what'll happen what's going to happen day after tomorrow think through all of the consequences of you deciding to use tonight will you exercise if you use what will happen to your diet will you work on your screenplay play the tape through to the end what will this weekend look like play the tape through just think it through all the way to the end and you don't have to do this perfectly so there's going to be some resistance with people like but how do I know what to think about and I don't think it helps what you are doing it's not about doing it successfully you all have to understand the point of doing this is that there's a part of your brain that cannot predict the future well enough so it's going to fail you don't have to do it right you just need to keep practicing it and as you play the tape through over and over and over and again your brain will literally learn how to predict as it learns how to predict it will actually restrain you from using it'll become automatic you don't need to do it right you just need to do it and the Brain will take over the fundamental problem in addiction is that the brain is working against you instead of you it working for you and so what we need to do is just like just use it it's not about doing it right or wrong it's just about like getting the rust off right I don't need to actually I mean there's benefits to exercising right or wrong but any kind of exercise will move me in the right direction I just have to go for a walk every day that'll move me in the right direction so don't let the perfect be don't let perfect be the enemy of good okay now the last thing so we um we kind of talked about emotional awareness we talked a little bit about reactivity so a general goal of this is to reduce reactivity okay so remember that the core of the problem is to is that my relationship with myself is not good my ability to tolerate my impulses my emotions all that stuff is not good I seek other things to fix those problems so now what I'm going to end with is sort of like a psychological narrative spiritual sort of perspective so these are all the circuits but there's a deeper layer to this so when I have these circuits that work this way I end up living a life that is less than ideal as I live a life that is less than ideal I become ashamed of myself as I become ashamed of myself I start to form an identity of a particular person I'm a bad person and I feel shame so what I want you all to really understand is that as I form this identity I don't want to be that I don't want to feel this shame so what do I do I move away from here and I go out into the world and try to try to fix things out here I'm constantly trying to get away from myself I'm constantly trying to get away from myself and the more that I try to fix my life out there the worse it becomes because then what ends up happening I start engaging in relationships where if I can get this person to love me I will feel good about myself I use another person's esteem of me as a substitute for my self-love I throw myself into work in a really toxic way because if I can be the best at work I can feel good about myself and then what happens is if my self-worth is tied up into work or tied up into relationship my life becomes a ping pong ball and a good day at work makes me feel good about myself a bad day at work makes me feel bad about myself I lose control of my life because I don't get to decide how I feel about myself they get to decide how I feel about myself and as they get to decide how I feel about myself I can't control them but you know what I can control whether I get high today this is the core of the problem it's all an externally focused problem-solving strategy someone's saying I'm addicted to addiction absolutely this is why we have an addictive personality how do you fix this you have to be okay with what's in here so from a Psychotherapy perspective that means working on your shame you got to go and talk about your shame right and then what happens is as you work with a psychotherapist what they're going to do is they're going to help you understand that hey this ain't your fault or even if it is your fault this is really wild just because it is your fault does not mean you are a bad person making a mistake does not make you a bad person if you understand that you've got one of the biggest steps figured out if you don't understand that or that feels foreign to you that's what you need to work on a mistake is an action it's not a person the problem is that so many of us grow up in situations where our actions become our value we don't get to be decent human beings and get bees on tests whether I'm a good human being or a bad human being did I get an A or did I get a B so you have to tackle that shame whether you want a journal whether you want to go to therapy whether you want to meditate whatever you want to do the shame must go away and once the shame goes away then we can start to develop an identity of ourselves that we are comfortable in does that make sense like that's if you're ashamed of yourself you can't be happy with yourself the shame is what's getting in the way of your identity and this is where at the end of the day the real value of spirituality is that the true self is behind all of that shame so I don't know if this kind of makes sense may not make sense but I'm going to say it anyway because maybe one percent of y'all that understand this and for those of you all that I'm gonna say it what I am is me it's neither good nor bad arguably it's divine sometimes it's amazing there's some kind of inner peace the problem with people with addictions is they have no access to that inner human being who is peaceful between me and the inner peace that we talk about with meditation or Enlightenment or whatever is this Wall of Shame and negative identity so anytime I move internally all I experience is shame and negativity and so then I have to run away from it and I have to externalize my attention I have to either have sex or binge eat or play video games or use drugs to get away from my internal self I'm running away from myself but the problem is that the real stability of self-worth is actually on the other side of that wall of Fire it's on the other side of the shame it's on the other side of the low self-esteem and for you to realize that actually you're just you you're perfect there's nothing wrong with you can you acquire addition additional skills absolutely can you become a better human being can you become a better student can you become a better father can you become a better partner can you become a better friend absolutely but there's not anything fundamentally wrong with you and so the real cure for addiction is to connect with that part of you and so this is why we see that spiritual healing for addictions is so powerful that once you realize that hey what is on the inside is not something to be not something I need to run away from the addiction will collapse like a house of cards and I have seen it happen over and over and over again once you realize that there's decentness in here you don't need to run away from here you don't need to run away from your emotions you're not a pathetic human being and then you don't need to cope with anything do you all get that addiction is coping there's dysphoria that we don't know how to deal with and if we take away the dysphoria which is exactly what the addiction tries to do but only temporarily once we no longer need to run away from ourselves we don't need any kind of addictive substance there's nothing to run away from so if you really want to conquer addiction it's all of the above the end goal is to love yourself be okay with what's happening in here as emotions arise you deal with those emotions in here this is where the emotion takes place as you start internalizing your awareness you will start to conquer the addiction but before we get to that point we sometimes need to do things like Psychotherapy or get some kind of help through journaling or whatever and in addition to that there's all kinds of other stuff that we can do we can practice body scans to increase our emotional awareness we can play the tape through to the the end to help our brains make stop making bad decisions we can control our impulses either through focusing meditations like taratica is really good for that they're all of these deficits in the addicted brain and we think about that as a bad thing in a sense it obviously is but the good news is that for every deficit it is something that you can fix it is something that you can work on and as you fix one thing the next thing will become easier the next thing will become easier the next thing will become easier as you reduce your the sensitivity of your Kappa receptors you will literally need fewer fewer drugs literally and so there's absolutely like I don't care how bad your life has been I would say that I have seen one or two patients out of probably five thousand that I think are unable to conquer addiction literally unable but the success rate is like 4998 out of five thousand and I'm not saying that those 4 998 people conquered addiction what I'm saying is that there are only two people that I can think of that I do not think that this will work for them if applied in the right way foreign questions one hour and 35 minutes chat take some time sometimes will you take a break to heal your throat yeah but this is more important I probably got 10 minutes of voice left in me so make it good chat um why wouldn't it be possible for them so I think sometimes the the neuro circuitry is just so hardwired and sometimes there's like just such a severe lack of self-awareness that the person really needs like an externally controlled environment to manage their addiction here we are talking about how to help 4998 people and everyone's like well I wanted to help everybody I gotta be honest I I just think that you know there's limitations to this methodology okay what's your take on experimenting with micro dosing with psychedelics so let's talk about psychedelics for a second so I've had some patients who have had positive outcomes from using psychedelics even to overcome addiction um that being said I think that psychedelics you have to be really careful about because even the clinical trials that suggest psychedelics are good are clinical trials that are done in a very controlled way in my controlled way I don't necessarily mean just Medical what I mean is that the therapeutic value of psychedelics seems to be very tightly linked to the environment and processing that's done afterward so when you do like 16 sessions of Psychotherapy with like two or three doses of psychotherapy uh psychedelics to process appropriately that's what leads to good outcomes Even in our old spiritual Traditions like you look at like Shamanism or something like that they're not just done by someone sitting at home who's feeling bad about themselves they're done under the guidance of someone who is adept at their use and has a whole structure of safety around it so we have to understand that it is not the Psychedelic that is responsible for the healing it is the whole package that is responsible for the healing so that's why I would strongly advise against them because we just don't really know and I've seen lots of examples of like psychedelics being used by people who are depressed and it just gives them PTSD like so it's playing with fire right so can fire do a lot of good yeah absolutely but it can also do a lot of bad micro dosing I'm even more against so this is where if we look at the the scientific data there's there's scientific data that supports the possible therapeutic value of actually hide higher dose of psychedelics so there's you know researchers at Hopkins talk about the heroic dose so you need to use a limited it seems like clinically what is probably going to be good is limited use but a sufficient dose micro dosing I think there's actually a meta-analysis that came out recently that shows that it's like probably pretty harmful so I know it's like all the rage but that feels to be really much more like an addiction as opposed to like some kind of growth related thing how do you suggest procrastinating on a drug or waiting out a craving so check out our video on urge surfing I don't know exactly what it's called it may be called something else um but I think that's where like you know you don't have to resist all of the urges all the time that's where we want to control things like environments so that the Cravings are manageable so if I'm in early stage recovery and I go to a bar where everyone's drinking and alcohol is my drug of choice it's going to be really hard to resist the urge it's easier to perhaps resist the urge to go to the liquor store and buy something because there's a long Gap between urge and action so you first thing you want to do is try to set your environment up so that you cannot quickly capitalize on an urge so simple example when I'm working with people who are addicted to gaming is I'll tell them to log out of all of their Auto login things increase the barrier that you have to overcome because that'll give you time to write out the urge and then you could use things like breathing exercises or going for a walk or even just getting up and like pacing in your own house you can also do things like Splash cold water on your face though all those things will help with urges and then you can also do things like train a habit so you may say okay but if I have an urge to play it's hard to get myself up to splash water on my face so then what I would say is build a habit of before you play any video game you're gonna get up and wash your face and you're going to log out of all of your devices and then if you do those sequence of things your gaming will actually go down what types of psychotherapy do I recommend what a great question so the short answer is it depends so Psychotherapy the recommendation of psychotherapy is based on you as well as what your goals are so for addictions I think motivational interviewing is excellent but I also think that depending on what kind of addiction you have you may really want trauma-informed therapy um I'm a big fan of like mindfulness stuff I think we've sort of figured out that mindfulness adds a layer to therapy that is just additional it's just like additional gravy so it it doesn't it's just a net positive so I think we were sort of discovering that any therapy therapy gets you so much value and then if you add some kind of meditation on top there's just an additional value to be gained can you be addicted when you quit weed for months maybe probably not but this is where you have to think a little bit about your relationship to wheat so one of the trickiest things that people will do is they will their addictive brain will give them a hurdle to jump over before they get free use so if your brain is like oh like if you're really addicted what your brain may actually do is say hey if we can quit for a week that means we're not addicted so then we're fine then we can use as much as we want so it's really interesting to think a little bit about how the addictive brain works and how it'll sort of like it'll set targets for you that will allow you to be convinced that you're not addicted and once you're sure you're not addicted the addiction can run wild what are your thoughts on food and sugar addiction everything that I've said applies so what we sort of know is that there's some common mechanisms to all addictions and that's like a lot of the stuff that I was talking about about managing your internal stuff with external things and then we also know that there are some unique things to different addictions and there's a reason why some people get addicted to food it's because the way that they're wired makes them vulnerable to that particular thing and there are particular nuances to food and sugar addiction for sure but everything applies why do I have an addictive personality even though I grew up in a healthy household what a good question so I can't say for you specifically but let me think about this so a lot of times we have addictive personalities because we grow up in situations where we are taught to manage our internal emotional state through some sort of external thing but sometimes we have let me let me I don't know if that makes any sense give me a second let me think about that again okay if we grow up in a traumatic household sometimes we'll develop an addictive personality and what is an addictive personality an addictive personality means that I use something outside of me to fix something inside of me that's the core of an addictive personality that's why it's an addictive personality you don't get addicted to just one thing you get addicted to all kinds of stuff and why is that it's because fundamentally the way to fix what's in here is by using something out there it doesn't really matter what that thing out there is so if I feel bad about myself if I'm unhappy one way to fix that is to get other people to love me so I get addicted to relationships and sex another way to fix feeling bad about myself is to use drugs right because I can make those negative feelings go away another way to fix the insecurity within me I don't love myself I'm not worthy of love is to accomplish a lot of things in the external world to be number one to be CEO to be a millionaire to be an alpha because I don't feel good about myself so I have to prove it I need proof and the only time you need proof is when you don't have belief right so if I don't believe I'm a good person I need proof and so you can even have an addictive personality if you grew up in a healthy household because the core part of it is how do you feel about yourself what do you get from pursuing that thing diving into this diving into that learning this thing and oftentimes what you'll discover is that you're using that thing to fix something in here and I've seen addictive Personalities in people who grow up in happy households but even in those happy households there are subtle things going on remember that 64 percent of the population has adverse childhood experiences or traumatic experiences growing up 64 percent but when 64 percent of people look at when we look at people growing up it's not like 64 of their people think that their childhoods are traumatic in some way the number seems way lower and so you can cause that psychological damage with unexpected things foreign yep 64 is high trauma addiction absolutely go hand in hand addiction and ADHD go hand in hand there's uh we have a a YouTube video about ADHD and addiction because if you look at a lot of these neuro Neuroscience stuff right so impulsivity frontal lobe executive dysfunction all that stuff makes you vulnerable to addiction can a family appear healthy when it isn't absolutely so this is the other thing to understand is that even healthy families can be unhealthy right no family is perfect no parent is perfect so the unfortunate reality is that you can try to be the best parent that you can and you're still going to screw up your kids in some way into the process of being human is in recognizing like I had a great childhood in a lot of ways I also had a video game addiction and all kinds of problems just because no one's perfect and that's part of humanity and so what you have to do as a human is like recognize okay what what did your parents not do perfectly which you can't blame them because it's not like they go to Parenting school and for like 50 years before they have kids right most of it is Instinct in what we're taught and then you have to do some work yourself what books do you recommend that are insightful helpful in recovering probably um the body keeps the score it's a book about trauma but you know I read Gabor mate's in the realm of hungry ghosts and it's like okay like I think it's a really great book in some ways but maybe just not my cup of tea I I guess here's here's the big problem that I have is people will ask what books do you recommend so what's the purpose of reading a book the purpose of reading a book is to gain some sort of information or understanding and when I think it comes when it comes to addiction this is actually half the problem is that the information or understanding that you need isn't going to come from a book you're looking in the wrong direction look within yourself like I know it sounds kind of cliche but really I think that's like a huge part of it is that people with addictions look to the outside to fix what's in here and even looking to the outside to educate yourself about what's in here is going to be worth a fraction of what you can learn by paying attention to this if you want to know what book to read write read the book that you write about your own internal experience write a book about why do I do these things how do I feel about myself what is it that increases my cravings What is it that decreases my Cravings why is it that I'm able to resist a craving on one day and not resist the craving on a different day how to quit porn so good question so how to quit porn if you've tried everything so remember that addiction is very hard to overcome in a vacuum or in your current state of life so the number one variable that correlates with pornography addiction is meaninglessness so if you really want to quit pornography what you need to do is build a life of meaning and what that sort of entails is some amount of introspection like what do you want from life because if you want to quit pornography you have to re have a reason to not watch and the whole problem is that you don't have a good enough reason to stop watching porn for my health what is that for my relationships to help me move forward why do you need to move forward what do you really care about so I'd say if you're struggling with pornography go and do something substantial for other human beings number one go like volunteer or whatever and do it consistently for like six months that'll help you develop some sense of meaning because pornography addiction is all about my relationship with my internal feelings I'm bored I don't feel good about myself pornography addiction is an emotional coping mechanism so you have to feel good about yourself and you can't just overcome that by stopping watching pornography you have to go and do something on the outside and the second thing you've got to do is ask yourself what you want from life and then once you understand what you want from life if you're like I don't know or I guess I want what other people have that's not good enough right it's not going to actually motivate your behavior and then the third question you've got to ask yourself is once you figure out what you want from life what are you willing to sacrifice in order to get it are you willing to sacrifice pornography in order to achieve that thing and the answer is probably going to be no which is why you need to go back to question number two and keep asking that question until you find something that it is worth giving up pornography for and until you find that thing you're going to be addicted to porn okay maybe time for one more question okay um okay this is a good question okay so man so many good questions okay all right let's start with this one how long does it take to reverse the changes of addiction so I'd say that within two weeks you see some reversals additional reversals will start to happen in about three or four months I think there's another kind of like there's kind of like plateaus of progress so even within one week of sobriety you'll start to see some changes in the brain three to four months out you can still see some long-term changes 12 months to 18 months is when you really start to see some solid changes in life not within you but within life and then I would say three to four years out you're going to be completely different because once you start seeing that momentum it takes time for momentum to build so just to give you all an example I had a patient who was addicted to heroin it took him about one week of sobriety two weeks of sobriety to like stop feeling terrible every day but they still felt kind of crap so they felt kind of neutral until about four months in four months in is when they started to feel good like feel normal it then took him about 18 months to decide to enter into a graduate program and become a therapist themselves and about three years out they finished their degree and like you know gotten a nice place that they were renting had like a nice house or in a stable relationship and we're like starting to earn back money and then like four years out they were like living a normal happy life where they were helping other human beings had a mortgage were engaged that's how long it takes thoughts on 12-step programs so I think 12-step programs can be good for a fair chunk of people but if a 12-step program doesn't work for you there are all kinds of other alternatives to 12-step programs aren't we just a placing replacing addictions with addictions not really so some people wonder whether life is a series of upgrading art addictions so I used to use drugs to cope now I use meditation to cope am I still not just coping in life so if you feel like life is a series of upgrading addictions here are the break points that become really important so the first is if you move away from drugs to a healthy coping mechanism are you still coping yes but the big difference is that once you use a healthy coping mechanism the coping mechanism does not create additional damage so when I use drugs it causes me more problems when I use a coping mechanism I may not fix the underlying issue but I'm not hurting myself in the future so that's the first break point but you're still right that as long as you're using a coping mechanism it's not fixing the underlying problem and that's where the real freedom from addiction comes in so once we start no longer needing to cope that is when we're done with the ball game we've won the game at that point now how do you get to that we conquer the need to cope when the stuff in here is no longer bad so if I feel ashamed of myself if I don't love myself if I lack the ability of self-compassion I need to use drugs that kind of self-hatred I can then replace the drugs with meditation which is healthier and as I replace it with meditation I stop screwing myself up in life which then really tills the soil for self-love but eventually what I want to do is get through that shame and start to realize that I'm actually a decent human being and once I realize that I'm a decent human being I don't need to meditate every day to avoid negative emotions or cope with meditation negative emotions once I love myself I can start to meditate every day to build something positive as opposed to get something get rid of something negative and once I do that then I've won the game foreign all right chat can THC be a good thing sure it can so we know that for example I think like the best examples of THC being a quote unquote good thing or in patients with chronic opioid addictions or people who are in chronic pain so we know that THC can be used as a harm reduction strategy for people who are on very high pain pain medication we also use THC have used THC for decades in things like cancer treatment because it does things like stimulate appetite when you're in chemotherapy and you don't feel like eating anything and so we I mean we've been using THC medically for many years so it can it can be a good thing absolutely all right chat so thank you very much for coming today um you know for those of you all that caught this a little bit later maybe go back and watch the beginning so today we did a deep dive into addiction and sort of trying to explain like what y'all need to understand about addiction it's not about the details of a particular substance or diagnosis but how can you understand how and why an addiction forms and once we understand how and why in addiction forums we also lay the foundation for how we can fix it and so hopefully that's been helpful to you all we're doing a lot of stuff like this during mental health May so stay tuned to our various channels and things like that we'll be bouncing all over the place we're going to be doing travel we're showing up on some podcasts we're doing some interviews and we're trying to basically figure out what is the most high impact stuff that we can do part of the reason that we're doing deep Dives on trauma in addiction and not deep Dives on things like depression anxiety ADHD or meditation is because we actually have deep Dives for those things already as Dr K's guide so if y'all like today's stream but you want even more right so we've got about 20 to 30 35 36 videos on topics like depression anxiety meditation and ADHD so check out Dr K's guide we also have things like worksheets and exercises a lot more details on how to implement Solutions like here is the actual meditation technique for this particular problem we just don't have time for that so just to give you all an example um you know each guide has a script that's about a hundred thousand words and is like one full week of like videos in terms of filming and we just can't do that all the time right so today we sort of gave you all 90 minutes on addiction if you guys want more on that we'll we're we may build a guide or something like that but if you guys want those other topics we've got way more as well as implementation strategies so check those out um and then lastly thank you to all of you for the support that you all give us um we're really grateful for all the donations all the subs things like that we also

and stuff like that we've got another product that's coming out in a couple weeks stay tuned to help you all even more um we have all these community events on Discord and stuff like that to help you all learn EQ and learn about your emotions we recognize that not everyone can afford stuff and we also it's really cool but HG is now in 132 countries and so we also you know recognize a lot of y'all don't have resources so we're going to do our level best to produce as much stuff as we can and make it as uh available as as possible and so huge thank you to everyone who supports Us in terms of donations trying out our products and services so we take all of the revenue to build additional stuff and even if there's no Revenue that's actually okay so huge shout out to platforms like YouTube
