this cognitive strategy leads to good material outcomes at the cost of suffering so this is a min max strategy to improve your outward life at the cost of your inner life it's the person who feels like they're inadequate so i see this a lot when i work with medical students where no amount of work that they do is enough we also see this a lot in content creators so if you all have watched a lot of our interviews and stuff with content creators you'll see that a lot of content creators never feel satisfied and so if you have like self-loathing is your fuel it's like a dirty fuel right it's not like this green clean energy it's like some you know scuffed like coal like dirty pollution generating but oh man it's like so sweet and so easy and it keeps you going right [Music] why is it that i always feel like i'm not doing enough and i'm not getting enough like no matter what or how much i have i don't feel satisfied and i want more to the point i start hating myself for not trying harder or doing more this is tricky so sometimes we feel like we're not doing enough and we're not getting enough and so we don't feel satisfied and we want more right this is a really common experience so why does this happen and what are the consequences of it okay so we're gonna get to like where this comes from in a second but let's start by understanding that this cognitive strategy leads to good material outcomes at the cost of suffering so this is a min max strategy to improve your outward life at the cost of your inner life right like you all see that so it's the person who feels like they're inadequate so i see this a lot when i work with medical students where no amount of work that they do is enough and so they have to like grind and do more they just never feel satisfied in themselves there's always someone who's smarter there's always someone who's studying more there's always someone who's getting better grades and there's always someone out there who's doing more we also see this a lot in content creators so if you all have watched a lot of our interviews and stuff with content creators you'll see that a lot of content creators never feel satisfied and so often times these are very successful content creators and so if you look at this mindset right which is almost like the high conscientiousness high neuroticism from a five factor model which is which by the way is the temperament of people who are in medical students what you sort of find is that like it's successful right so why does this happen from an evolutionary standpoint the reason it happens is because it's successful we actually select for success through this kind of stuff because if you're never satisfied it's going to cause you to work harder and like to the point i start hating myself for not trying harder or doing more and so if you have like self-loathing is your fuel it's like a dirty fuel right it's not like this green clean energy it's like some you know scuffed like coal like dirty pollution generating but oh man it's like so sweet and it's so easy and it keeps you going right like you can burn down entire forests but like you can just destroy all that nature but boy it keeps you going so it's like this dirty fuel that's easily accessible and the cool thing is if you kind of like think about it for a second this is a never-ending source of fuel because if you're never satisfied with your work no matter how much you work you're never going to be satisfied so you're always going to work harder and so it's like it's like this never-ending source of like toxic fuel the problem is when you burn it it like pollutes the hell out of your life in your mind but you're going to be successful right you're going to be successful and for a lot of people that's what we care about that's what we're conditioned to care about that's all we want is to be successful because then we'll have the respect and we'll have money and we'll have comfort we'll have all these kinds of things so the first thing to understand is that this mindset is not a problem it's a solution it's a certain way of fueling your productivity and ideally like results in success now the problem with this is that in my experience this does not actually lead to the best outcomes this leads to good outcomes but if you want to go from like 75 productivity to like 100 productivity you can't have this attitude so this attitude is contrary to the flow state you can't attain the flow state if you're beating yourself up because the flow state is one where you're like kind of peaceful and like focused on your task and you're doing it for you know it's just a different state of consciousness which if you're beating yourself up you're never gonna attain so the next question is okay where does this come from so first let's understand that this is adaptive second thing is that oftentimes this too has some kind of psychological root so when did you start feeling like you were not good enough right so that's like really really important like when did this start where is the origin of this feeling that i'm not good enough and and sometimes like you know i don't know if what the ethnicity of this person is or you know anything like that but like we see this a lot not just i mean i'm gonna use a particular diaspora because that's common in the u.s but you know people from all over the world experience this where like you'll have a set of parents who are not really happy with what you do they'll they'll not really be happy in your accomplishments all they really care about is that you outperform everyone else so unless you're number one in the class like that's not really that important like i why can't you be like so-and-so's kid who plays the violin and has an a in math and so you'll have parents who are very unsatisfied with you the other really damaging thing about this which i think is even more insidious which i don't hear a lot of people talk about is when you do achieve what do you get from your parents what you get is externally facing pride and what do i mean by that when you get an a plus and you're at the first chair in violin or whatever right and you're like president of the math club what does your parent do do they say good job i'm so proud of you you did so good this weekend we can do whatever you want to you're such a hard-working kid you make me so proud no that's not what they do what they do is they talk to their social circle about that right they don't even like reward you it's just like now i have bragging rights so when they go and they meet their friends at whatever like at some party right now it's like now you're the easiest kid to brag about and so even the reinforcement that you get even when you accomplish things like you don't get satisfied you you get that like you don't like your parents aren't like good job i'm so proud of you right it's like the the the positive you're working so hard for this positivity and you don't even get it from them you get like a little bit and instead what they do is they turn their pride to the external world and they post about it and they tell their their sister who they've always had a competitive relationship with my boy soon number 999 is a plus in math club president violin thing right that's where they actually put all their pride they don't put it back into you and so then you're left feeling unsatisfied and then like this is like a core sort of thing where like you're conditioned to think that the way to be satisfied is to be number one but even when you become number one or as you get close to number one or chances are you're not number one because it's really hard to be number one all the time you sort of feel emotionally like unsatisfied and then you carry that emotional dissatisfaction with you and that emotional dissatisfaction with which you carry with you because it's a wound from a prior like emotional experience you can try to go fix it in the world today but it's never going to get fixed because it's not the wound is from before right the hunger is from before and i don't know how to say this but like to be blunt half the problems that we get into is because we're trying to fix things from our past in our present like we see this all the time in in terms of relationships where it's like you know we'll say so and so has daddy issues and mommy issues like we even understand that like colloquially like we get this and what does that even mean it means that my relationship with my parents my dad or my mom is somehow something i'm trying to fix in this relationship and then it sabotages this relationship because this relationship has its own problems has nothing to do with mom and dad and then why do we call it daddy issues or mommy issues we don't say daddy issues or mommy issues in successful relationships we see them in unsuccessful relationships why didn't the relationship work out oh he had daddy issues or he had mommy issues or she had daddy issues that's why the relationship didn't work out and why didn't it work out it's because they're trying to they're carrying stuff from the past which they project onto their current relationship and so as long as you're trying to fix the past in the present it ain't gonna work and what you'll end up is like this which is not feeling satisfied and always wanting more there's going to be a fundamental sense of dissatisfaction because you can't fix the past in the present just not possible due to physics does that make sense so understand where your dissatisfaction comes from the dissatisfaction clearly does not correlate with your actual performance does that make sense because if if dissatisfaction correlated with your performance if your performance increased then your dissatisfaction should decrease the two are completely independent variables so then the question is what the hell does this dissatisfaction correlate with the dissatisfaction correlates with a sense of a lack of self-worth a lack of forgiveness a lack of like accepting yourself for where you are right it comes from striving being conditioned to strive and always wanting to do better so it's challenging but very common and very adaptive right even if you think about if you're like an immigrant like i am or like come from an immigrant family this is the attitude that we grew up with and why did we grow up with this attitude there's a selection bias so even if you look at evolution there's something called the founder effect which explains a lack of genetic diversity so when you have a group of people that when you have a thousand people and a hundred of them go to an island and they hang out there and they you know populate and then when that population goes to a thousand what you'll see is like an uneven amount of particular genetic alleles and why is that it's because you're kind of populating this with a certain set of traits and so if you're you're in it come from an immigrant family why is this common in immigrants it's because the immigrants who were dissatisfied with their situation and be beaten beated and beat themselves up were the ones who successfully left the country they're the ones who became doctors and engineers and software developers and business people and things like that right and then they successfully moved and then we see it and now we have a whole culture that's like this because you have 10 successful people who are dissatisfied with themselves moving and then since they're dissatisfied they're always competing each other and they all have kids and then they pass that competition onto you and then we end up like this you
