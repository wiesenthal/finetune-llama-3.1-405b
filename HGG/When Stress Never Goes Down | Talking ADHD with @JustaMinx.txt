so when you're a kid with adhd at the age of seven and everyone's in recess is standing in line to get on the slide and when you have adhd and you can't stand in a line so you wander away and then you come back and you cut right because you were in line you were ahead of this kid and then you wandered away for a minute and now that kid is like second from the front and you step back in front of him and you're like this is my place in line and then you cause conflict so you can sort of like look at someone who's like bipolar has major depressive disorder and you can see like okay this is not how the brain is supposed to be working whereas the interesting thing about a personality disorder is that even though it causes them problems it's the way that their brain grew up learning how to survive but it's kind of this idea that like i don't know how else to say it it's just replacing in your mind so when your mind reacts to something it's never and it's always but yes right it's either or i can be mad at you and still love you but someone with bpd can't hold both of those thoughts that's why it's so terrifying i am self-aware when it's happening and i'm trying to tell myself stop thinking this calm down so i can't let me ask you a question makes do you think that personalities can change over the course of someone's life [Music] welcome thanks thanks for having me oh thanks thank you very much for coming on i know sometimes it makes people kind of like nervous anxious to be on and we really appreciate you yeah i'm excited i'm excited and can you tell me first um what do you go by or what would you like to be called today uh minx works okay and is there something in particular that you wanted to talk about or anything that we could potentially help you with well nah there's so much things i need help with where there's not specific uh sure i'm [Music] kind of nervous i don't even know what i should say first maybe maybe yeah maybe even if chat you push me how to start i'm like this is kind of new for me yeah absolutely so um let's we don't ever want to push you right okay so but we can absolutely get started and maybe what i can do is sort of like take the lead if that makes you a little bit more comfortable so the first thing that i want to point out is that a lot of times if we're thinking about what we want to work on there are like so many different things and they're all like tangled together and so it can feel like we don't even know where to start is that kind of what you're feeling uh yeah pretty much every single day of my life every single day wow that sounds how do you deal with that not when i well when i i take my adderall is what i do and then i'm straight ahead focus on what i need to do wow so it sounds like adderall really helps you ah i also think that uh it doesn't help me as much as i think it does i think every time it's like a metal thing similar to in the past when i used alcohol as a like because i was shy or anxious where i could have one shot and then i'd be like social for the night when realistically it's just a brain thing yeah so i'm almost hearing that the adderall changes your sense of confidence more than it actually changes your brain and you're like yeah that i've taken out all i can work yeah i feel like if i take it i'm like i know i have to work because i'm like you know it's prescription it's prescribed so i'm like once it's there it's like well now i have to work i can't just doss around and do nothing yeah absolutely um can i share with you kind of an interesting study i read recently about medication for adhd yes so they did an interesting study on kids with adhd and parenting styles of kids with adhd so what they found is that when a kid has adhd it's very very frustrating for the parent and the parent actually will like yell a lot more when their child has adhd so kids with adhd have this thing called passive non-compliance where their focus is like so big on a particular thing that the parent is kind of like talking to them and saying hey it's time to go to school it's time to go to school it's time to go to school and the kid just isn't paying attention like that's that's what adhd is right it's a problem with attention and then eventually what happens is the parent yells at the kid and then the kid gets yelled at they get kind of snapped out of like what they were doing parent is kind of frustrated and angry and then then the kid listens and then over time the parent actually learns to like yell more often because that's what it takes to get a kid to listen with me so far yeah so the weird thing is that when you give the kid the medication and you actually test in a laboratory their ability to focus it does not change at all but what changes is the parents behavior once a child is medicated and we're not quite sure how that works but something about the medication allows kids to listen to their parents better even though their inattention score does not change so their ability to focus doesn't change but it's weird so it definitely does change something it improves their symptoms like so if you look at like them getting in trouble at school them doing their homework them being late to school it improves all of the outcomes that adhd sort of causes like it causes people to be spacey causes them to be late causes them to be disorganized so it fixes all those things but it doesn't actually change their mind's ability to like focus and we don't quite know why that is but it's really interesting what the hell no that makes sense because i was like because so adhd medication in ireland like in ireland when i was being diagnosed like it took me months to get diagnosed with bpd and i was like in the process of being diagnosed with adhd for months and then i came to america and i was like oh i'll continue with but i had to restart and i was diagnosed within two weeks which is insane to me how quick it is over here and then we don't even have adderall in ireland we we i think it's i don't even know what we have because i was never on the medication but like they just threw adderall at me immediately and i thought that fixed everything but exactly what you said there where i like i did a test with it where i was like i'm doing nothing today and i had it and i i think it was more a mental thing where i was like i should work because i've had it but realistically i was able to lie it's weird yeah tell me more about that that sounds so i i'd love to hear kind of your experience of that if you feel comfortable sharing it's just i think i've always like i'm i kind of have a fear of adderall if that makes sense because it's it's not necessarily banned in ireland we just don't have it and like it's just talked about a lot where it like makes you almost like you're just ooh you know energy energy energy so i was always scared of it where the i actually i'm on 15 mg twice a day but i don't take that i like break it in half and do 7.5 and then if i need more of it um but then like if i take one whole pill even though it doesn't make a big difference in my head i'm like whoa bro i'm so focused right now but it does feel like a lot of the time it's more me telling myself i'm focused than actually feeling focused but now i feel like reliant on it when i need to do work like if i need to sit and do meetings and stuff i like have to you know take an adderall which is kind of annoying because i've had adhd my whole life and i was able to you know survive without it until i came to america but now i feel like i caught in survivor outward you can't survive without not survival like do my work with it like i couldn't like i feel like now i can't like go through emails for three hours or like do all that well without it yeah i mean i think going through emails for three hours without it sounds terrible for anyone let alone you got me there actually you know because i'm wondering then if it's if it's just that it's not that how can i say this i i know it's kind of weird because that's your experience and i don't want to disagree with it but what i i'm wondering is whether you're just like doing more now like whether your plate is just stacked higher with like stuff to do that actually could be it too because to be fair when i was in ireland it was just me myself a nina little renovated morgan here i'm like living with roommates and going out consistently because l.a yeah might be it too yeah so how are you feeling now by the way are you okay talking about this you feeling like nervous or does this feel okay no i actually feel fine talking about because i usually don't get to talk about like this stuff on my stream at all yeah can i i'm just so curious i'd love to learn more about your experience because you mentioned in ireland it took like you were getting diagnosed for months yeah and and can you tell me a little bit about what that was like yeah so i never um actually got diagnosed in ireland with adhd i was like going through a bunch of tests uh and it was similar where to be fair a lot of the time i wasn't making myself to go to the appointments like every two weeks or week because i'm like uh you know it's taking forever like with my bpd it took like i think nine months to get properly diagnosed because they didn't want to uh mess up the diagnosis and stuff and can you help us understand what bpd is uh it's like borderline personality disorder uh it's it's honestly hard to explain it really has a bad rep um but i personally like think it helps me with my content because if i'm like having a really bad mood swing that i can't control i throw it into like you know acting where it's like a lot of my crazy bits come from that but it's it it took months where it felt like a it felt treacherous and honestly that's my question i'm like america's so quick with diagnosis where i'm like are they misdiagnosed or is ireland just so slow that took months to diagnose what do you think you've been evaluated in both places who do you think is doing better uh so honestly i i like how america was so quick because i feel like i've always known i've had adhd and it was taking months like i've always been aware of that but i've never like had the proper diagnosis except for when i was 16 but like they threw that out the window because temple street is weird it's a weird dublin hospital um but at the same time i also worry about how quick they diagnosed you with it like my adhd was like three phone calls not even meeting me in person or like like three phone calls on a questionnaire while in ireland it was like i had to meet amy in person every week and do different like tests and stuff and like before i got like diagnosed with anything yeah so i'm i'm i'm happy to share some thoughts on that but i just want to make sure we're kind of like okay with talking about this so i'm gonna ask you one or two questions that are like because you're you're sharing your experience of diagnosis and i may be able to shed some light on that but i want to ask you one or two questions that are like a little bit more medical is that okay like you recognize we're on the internet and stuff like that right yeah so when you were in in ireland um were you being evaluated for bpd or evaluated for adhd um so i was diagnosed with bpd two years ago but it took months but when i was in ireland before i came to america i was in the middle of an evaluation for adhd that was ongoing for about it was somewhere between four to six months so did they get sidetracked from the adhd and went into the bpd no so i was diagnosed with bpd first before anything um and then i like brought up amy was just asking she was like you know have you ever looked into adhd and i explained how like at 16 i was like being evaluated for it but with my epilepsy for some reason they just kind of threw that to the side um so then she started the diagnosis for my adhd but it was like four months of like different kind of tests and stuff but to be fair this was also like free healthcare like what i've noticed is like yeah you pay for a lot in america but like they're quicker with what they do half the time so yeah so here's here's what i'd share so i think a lot of times the amount of time it takes to diagnose different psychiatric things is different yeah so uh bpd is is borderline personality disorder which sounds like devastating like if you're just you have a disorder in your personality you're screwed for life and by the way um your experience is not uncommon so i do think a couple things i feel like we got to talk about bpd for a second so the first is that i think bpd gets a very very bad rap um i think the second thing is that a lot of very very high functioning and successful women have bpd um it's i just it's just it's just facts um so a lot of the women that i've worked with who have bpd are also very very successful and very high functioning and something about it i think is similar to what you're saying where there like something about it like makes them and we could theorize more i could share what my thoughts are on that if you're curious about that but make something about how sensitive they are to criticism and how careful they are about like it's so damn important to do a good job if you've got bpd that's been my experience of sitting with people who have it i'm like honestly definitely interested in hearing more about bpd from you because in ireland like it was very very like it yeah it's i feel like it's not as not common but like they my first therapist like she almost misdiagnosed me with um uh minor sociopathic tendencies which when i went to amy my new one she was like that is not like nowhere near you why would she say that because like bpd is so like i guess not it's not uncommon it's just i feel like not really spoken about a lot um and then like they they just put me on the same like lamictal mood disorder pills for it but here in america they won't give me my damn prescription are you joking about being frustrated about that are you actually frustrated i can't tell it's just kind of annoying because they won't give me it they're like no this is an irish prescription and i'm like mate you gave me adderall within two weeks and you can't see my name is on these papers and they don't want to prescribe it no they don't do they think you do you mind if i ask them questions like not so much about your diagnosis and stuff but what's that like in terms of like what have you explained to them what do they understand do they not think that you need it do they disagree what they want me to go through another like they want me to re like they want to re-diagnose me because they said like la michtel is one of the minor ones they think i should be on like i don't know what the pill is called it's like a mix between depressive and mood disorder one so they want to kind of completely restart from the beginning do a fresh diagnosis that isn't from you know ireland and then give me something but i don't want to go through that i just want my goddamn lamigdal and so it sounds like when mctill helps you uh it's once again the kind of thing where it might it maybe i over think that it helps me and it doesn't help me because that's what my but my mom every time i call her having a little breakdown she's like get back on your limital and i'm like mother i cannot america is keeping it away from me that's so weird so they're they're really quick to diagnose adhd and not so quick to die that's that's strange right because adderall is a controlled substance it's a stimulant back when i was in residency one month's supply of adderall you could sell for a thousand dollars in in boston that was the street valley you know i'm gonna be keeping that i ain't i don't know i don't know i don't know if it's still the case but that's what you know hey i'm gonna be rich that that's just what i heard from you know my patients who were testing positive like you like i'd be working in the emergency room and someone comes in they test positive for adderall they don't have a prescription i'm like you haired that huh yeah don't worry mix you are awesome to talk to oh thank you i i i needed that i needed that no seriously it's it's been a long time since someone implied that i was selling drugs on the street it's been many many years now i didn't imply it you see the wings no no i know i know i know that's me that's me projecting right i'm reading into it it's actually completely neutral now you've admitted to your own fault i can't help you here well done well done for you i've been i've been actual checkmated signature um anyway what were we talking about oh yeah so so yeah i i think so let's just talk about the diagnosis of of bpd for a second um and you know i can pull out the the ipad and draw if that helps at some point okay if i'm saying things that are like hard to follow without visuals because i know also sometimes people with adhd really really benefit as being visual learners um so if that would help just let me know okay see i'll be real with you it would help but me admitting a drawing would help as a 25 year old grown woman on the internet it's kind of embarrassing but uh yeah pictures actually do help me pay more attention oh yeah so let's do it then because i mean that's that has nothing to do with you being 25 years old like you know drawings help all humans and especially when it's like weird confusing stuff okay hold on a second so this is going to turn into a lecture are you okay with that like a little one and then please ask questions okay so minx i'm gonna need your help all right yes so here's what i need you to do so i'm gonna give a lecture but my class size is going to be hold on is going to be like kind of like one because you're the only person i can talk to right now okay so what that means is that if i say something that doesn't make sense you're the only person who can let me know okay so what i'm going to need you to do is like pretend like you're you i need the activity from you that i would get from 30 students sitting in a classroom can you see this by the way it's just gonna be a black screen i can see it okay then we're gonna do this all right so let's start so you can see you can see this right yeah okay so let's run through a couple of different things about your experience the first is that so there's bpd there's adhd and a couple other things that we noticed is that it took you six months to get diagnosed in ireland two weeks in the u.s okay so like what's going on here how do we make psychiatric diagnoses so for for bpd it was nine months but i was in the middle of four six months for the adhd but never got fully diagnosed with it and then i came to america and went to continue and then it was just two weeks off the bath beautiful beautiful in the sense i love that level of participation okay um oh sorry you uh you said two weeks right is how long it took you in the us yeah so let's first talk about how these diagnoses are different so um has anyone explained to you or do you understand what the difference between a personality disorder and a non-personality disorder are uh personality disorders in your brain and cannot be fixed with meds very very good answer yeah so we have this thing called a personality right and our personality is sort of like the way that we perceive the world and also the way that we react to it so it's like you know if you think about what's the difference between two people's personality it's like you know if if both of us show up to a party this the situation is exactly the same but the way that will perceive the situation oh is everyone like looking at me and making fun of what i'm wearing or oh yeah this is awesome like everyone's so excited to see me like even though everyone's sort of acting the same way two different people could perceive it differently and then the way that we respond to that situation also changes does that make sense yeah okay so personality disorders also tend to be like developed early on so our brain like develops like a way of interacting with the world and then that pattern of like how we perceive and how we behave is sort of who we are and then if that if that gets laid down in a particular way that causes us suffering or some kind of impairment and function if it causes problems we call it a personality disorder does that make sense yes she do be causing problems yep and we'll talk a little bit about benefits of personality issues in a second but so the key thing about the personality disorder is that if you look at a human being a human being let's say like this is your stress level uh so um your stress level like that a tiny bit bigger uh we're talking about my stress levels like huge oh moon and back yep okay worried about heart there stress levels when i get that pickle and ex okay no the line never goes down oh we'll talk about that we'll talk about how the line never goes down there we go oh this is gonna be good okay don't let me forget about that okay minx okay so the key thing about the reason so personality disorders generally speaking are supposed to take a long time to diagnose and the reason for that is that if i'm stressed out i'm gonna be behaving in like a more impaired way right if i'm going through a temporary period of stress i'll be lashing out at people my mood will be more irritable i'll have difficulty sleeping i'll feel bad about myself does that make sense but it's just like it's like stress let's say like finals time for example or if someone you know loses their job or if there's a death in the family or you have a breakup or something like that there are all kinds of temporary things that will make you feel worse cause problems and impair function with me so the reason that we need time to diagnose a personality disorder is if we look at like let's say um someone without a personality disorder dude makes you're so good at this because this is what someone with a non-personality disorder may look like or yeah those lucky yeah they they certainly are or actually that's probably a better thing so they may have so if you look at just one point in time if we look at like this one month period for someone with a personality disorder and without a personality disorder it actually looks the same that's why we need a lot of time because is this your base like is this just who like is it part of your personality or is it a temporary effect due to stress does that make sense that makes a lot of sense actually yeah okay so this is why generally speaking it takes months it's supposed to take about six months okay right to diagnose a personality disorder because you need to see people through the ups and downs you need ups and you see you need downs and when you kind of like remove the ups and downs of temporary stress from the equation what you're left with is like their general way of functioning their default way of perceiving and behaving does that make sense that actually makes so much sense because i was so confused why i was taking so long nine months for something that you know isn't even fully medicated i thought they were just dusting around but that actually makes so much sense because everyone has stress everyone has different that oh my god yeah so let's see uh i don't know about that i think you're helping me a lot here this was this is all you minks this is all you so we're we're gonna do it together okay yes okay so now let's talk about medication so i know it sounds kind of weird okay i'm gonna ask you questions minx but i think you're gonna don't worry about giving me the right answer i just need someone to interact with and you unfortunately are the person on stream so what does medication do what do you think it does that's kind of weird supposed to help yeah and how do you think it helps by calming my mind when i'm about to blow up from something so small that it doesn't matter yep very good okay so and so like if we think about a medication like when you take adderall like that's a physical pill right how do you think and our mind is not physical right so how do you think what does the adderall do where does it go in your body and what does it act on my god my stomach okay wait what the hell no now i'm getting freaked out okay no what does that really do how does it affect me yeah you're good good where does it go after the stomach out my [ __ ] if it just slot okay so it gets absorbed to the bloodstream okay right it gets digested yes and then it goes to your brain okay okay two different answers there well i was pretty close this is a great oh my god this this is so much better than teaching at harvard medical school let me tell you what oh my god i would i would still be there if i had students like you okay and and then it like it does stuff to your neurotransmitters right this is am i what your neurotransmitters have you heard of these yeah have you heard of like serotonin and like dopamine and all this crap like we have wait okay so what's the difference between serotonin and dopamine great question i thought serotonin was like happiness but i think i was wrong with that yeah so this is where so here's the thing to understand about neurotransmitters so we have things like dopamine we have things like serotonin we also have uh you know noradrenaline let's say so the thing to understand is that neurotransmitters are like letters of the alphabet so like if i have a c and t i can put these together to form cat or tac or whatever they're just signals and so what they do depends on like how you arrange them and what part of the brain they're in so people think that dopamine is for example like the happiness neurotransmitter or serotonin is the happiness neurotransmitter but dopamine for example governs reward so when you do something that's fun and your brain is like oh i want more of that that's governed by dopamine but dopamine also does things like smooth movement so for example like if i wave my hand up and down my ability to control that is actually due to dopamine so they do yeah it's kind of all kinds of weird things so serotonin also governs like whether you have diarrhea or not in the gi system so well said you say you were right about it goes out the [ __ ] that's all adderall will stimulate that too it'll affect adderall will actually affect your appetite right so i don't know if you've experienced that yes so so you know we got to be we got to be clear that's why we got to be clear i don't know lost to me a nice little 15 pounds on that pill yeah right so it actually does all kinds of stuff so neurotransmitters do all sorts of things and generally speaking people have a simplistic view of them so this involves gi health in your gi tract this also includes motor stuff so there are all kinds of different neurotransmitters do all sorts of different stuff it just depends on where it is so it's kind of like a building block it's just a chemical signal in the brain but like you know um where that signal is and what's receiving it will determine what it does right so like let me just i'm trying to think this is gonna be a terrible analogy okay so if someone let's say i'm lying in bed at night and someone puts their arm around me and says i love you that signal means very different things whether i'm at home and in bed with my wife versus i'm sleeping in a hotel room on my own right if you're on your own that's the ghost mate yeah that's what i'm saying exactly right so even though the stimulus is exactly the same the the meaning of it and the effect of it is completely different because one is comforting and one is terrifying even though technically the words are the same the feeling is the same you with me oh yeah ew right it's a terrible analogy but okay so that's where these neurotransmitters are just different chemical signals in the brain and what they govern so serotonin like people think about serotonin as happiness because when someone has something like major depressive disorder or mdd and we give them a serotonin boosting agent what we find is that their depression gets worse oh it gets better so their depression goes down and they feel better so what we sort of do is we assume that a serotonin deficiency is causing depression does that make sense yes but it's not i mean serotonin does a lot more than that okay and it's dopamine dopamine the adderall helps oh yeah so so don't die they're so confusing they're all like the same thing but different oh yeah no it's it gets even more confusing like so here's the way that uh let me just think about whether i want to go into this so okay is that why mdma is called because mdd mdma is an mdma like happiness uh no i don't think those are related okay um so mdma mdma gives people a sense of connection so it does help with potentially mdd but you're you're right but for the world are those like are those like drugs then like they boost your dopamine no so so let's talk about mdd so this is depression and mdma okay let's talk about how this works so mdma which i do not recommend people use is also called ecstasy right yeah and generally speaking makes people feel very connected to each other right what the hell uh i i don't know i've never tried it but that's what i hear so let's talk a little bit about sure doc well said thanks okay so let's talk about depression so in depression what people get stuck on is thinking about themselves in a negative way so when i'm depressed i'm just thinking oh my god like i'm such a terrible person everyone else would be so much better without me um you know like like my family would be happier if i wasn't around they think all these like weird bizarre thoughts i don't know if you've experienced that or if you have friends like this are you kind of you know people feel that way and depression they always like think bad about themselves yeah so what happens here is we have this part of the brain called the default mode network and i know the acronyms are getting crazy here but the default mode network is the part of our brain that thinks about us so this is what separates humans from animals right so animals don't think about themselves we think about ourselves and when everything in our life becomes all about me me me me me but in a bad way we get stuck thinking about ourselves i can't think about something else i can't just sit outside and enjoy the sun because all i'm thinking about my my mind is like it's stuck on this thought that i'm a worthless person dmiu huh do monkeys have it aren't monkeys the closest to humans uh so they may have a very primitive default mode network but i don't think it's nearly as developed as ours really so we're basically stuck thinking about ourselves and so if i had to hypothesize how mdma can help is that remember mdma creates a sense of connectedness so i think it kind of stops this action of the default mode network where all we're thinking about is ourselves we're able to start thinking about other people and like connecting with other people and there are even studies that show that some of these uh drugs which are now being used as treatments for depression like ketamine work oh i've heard about the ketamine treatment the ketamine actually shuts off the default mode network so we've figured out how ketamine helps people with depression and the really interesting thing is that ketamine is the fastest acting treatment for depression that we've ever discovered okay so i heard about it my friend she was telling me that she she might be going for it but in ireland ketamine is known as horse tranquilizer sure so ketamine is also used in anesthesia what the frick yeah so so it because what ketamine does is it kind of like it's a dissociative agent so we'll use it in anesthesia to like if we're doing surgery on someone because they kind of get like disconnected from themselves what the hell why is everything the same it all loops back in together ketamine is in anesthesia that well yeah i mean you're not the only one right so if we look at other drugs for anesthesia like nitrous oxide people love that stuff too i don't know what that is uh that's like laughing gas okay i thought that was anesthesia yeah it is it is anesthesia okay right so a lot of the anesthetic agents can be drugs of abuse and and so you're right it all like yeah i mean it all yeah makes you're right it all connects okay should we go about oxy okay oxy is an opiate okay okay listen do you know i had a run-in with oxy so in ireland oxy's like banned completely banned here i had like surgery uh last year at the end of last year and they gave me oxy and i didn't even know anything about didn't know what it was but i would like go live and i'd be like yo i'm feeling good i'm feeling loopy and then my mother who was a nurse and a special needs assistant once she found out i was on it she was like please get off that please for me get off that it's addicting and then i did get off it like i threw it away and stuff but i didn't realize like it's a huge thing here in america yeah so a couple years ago i'll tell you a story so a couple years ago i was talking with some people who were in the leadership of the american psychiatric association and i was telling them hey i think technology addiction is a huge problem i think that people are starting to get addicted to technology i think it's causing a lot more problems than we realize i think we need to take this a little bit more seriously they were very very nice and very supportive but their response was right now this country is dying of opiates oxies are like killing people at an alarming rate and we have to fix that problem first and so it's really challenging but what happened to you is very common where where people like because people who aren't that familiar with addiction are usually the ones prescribing oxy right you'll get like surgery or you'll go to the emergency room with like a sprain or something like that and a surgeon will just prescribe oxy because that's you know it works really well and it and oftentimes like if you really think about it you know surgeons don't really sit down with you and ask you about like you know do you use drugs or they'll maybe will ask you do you use drugs then you say no and they're like all right here's a prescription feel like a warning should be like in place though because i have no idea i was just like okay this is gonna like make me feel better after surgery and like if my mom had not told me because i was i would obviously i was enjoying those pills they were putting like making my pain go away but i was also feeling like giddy i'm just i'm a mama's girl and i trust her where the moment she asked me to stop i stopped it and i went on um i think it was like title no um which did not it barely helped what's weird it's weird why do they give it up so easily especially like i feel like you know i'm irish i have an irish passport not even a state like they gave it so easily to me yeah so that's a complicated that answer is complicated but the short answer that i'd give you is that many many years ago when oxy came out the drug companies that made oxy really really pushed it and were probably not entirely honest about how addictive it was but they probably knew that it was very addictive and knew that it was very effective and so what they ended up doing is like sending a bunch of like pharmaceutical reps and then it essentially like became the standard of practice in medicine very quickly and so people just started like prescribing oxy before they realized how bad it was and now the problem is that it's so all over the place like you can think about it like almost like a smartphone where like now like everyone has internet on their phone and it's it's permeated the the american medical system so heavily that it's really hard to like go back and like change things now so it because a bunch of doctors just got trained in using it right it's so weird yeah it's it's bad man and then like now we have like fentanyl and then i've heard of fentanyl actually do you mind if i run to toilet sorry no go for it thank you okay i guess this is a dr k talks about different drugs stream yeah yeah oh yeah i i know that we started off with the diagnosis of bpd i didn't forget but it's good i mean we can it's important so so you know she's saying that like i didn't know that oxy was a problem and like that why do you all think we're talking about this now right because there's a very good chance that there are people out there right now that you're gonna get dental surgery done you're gonna get like a tooth taken out and your dentist will prescribe an opiate pain medication and you may be one of the unlucky people that has a genetic predisposition to opiate addiction and then it will transform your life like it'll be so amazing it's going to help with the pain so much right and so you all need to know these things because i don't know you know how many hours of education dentists get about like how to deal with addictions how to screen for addictions i'm sure they get trained i mean they obviously they know and must know that opiates can be addictive there's no question about that but it's just in terms of like there's a difference between telling a dent a dental student opiates are addictive and like really equipping them with the clinical skills to evaluate whether a particular patient is vulnerable to addiction so for example i've been to the dentist a ton of times no dentist has ever asked me do i have a history of opiate addiction in my family which is probably a question they should all ask before they prescribe it to you right like but it's just not a big part of their training that's so crazy like america's so no offense man america's so insane yeah like i feel like ireland's on the other end of the shtick though where they refuse to like give out like my older sister just got diagnosed with adhd recently and they refused to give her any meds which i don't think meds are okay needed no a controversial opinion tell me i just i'm like you know i feel like maybe it's just different for me like well since i've started taking adderall it makes me way more work focused but i also feel like not meaner but i want to get work done because like i said i've taken it and it feels like even though it doesn't drain my like loudness character i feel more serious when i have it and i'm just like i don't know man i'm like let nature take its course so you're i'm confused by that are you saying that so i'm hearing that it helps you but yeah but so where i am right now if i was to go back to ireland i won't have adderall and right now i rely on adderall a lot and maybe that's my own mental issue with it but like that's why i split it in half because i'm like don't want to run out of it don't want to do that if i'm splitting it in half and not even taking my right dosage yeah what what uh so that like i would not recommend but it's something that i've dealt with can i are we done with the lecture you want to talk about this for a second or you want me to keep drawing oh yeah we can talk about that okay give me just one second okay let me just stop sharing this move you back over here let's talk about this this is very important to talk about so okay so i'll can i share with you what my experiences of of patients who take half the medication they're supposed to yeah so generally speaking i don't think it's a good idea and here's why so i've had lots of patients who like you have adhd and are terrified of becoming dependent on adhd medication also terrified of doing things like running out because if i run out then i'll be non-functional so it's almost like you're saving for a rainy day or like preparing for winter right where we got to make sure we have lots of potatoes in the basement in case we run out of potatoes is that an attack on the famine duck just because i'm irish you could have said brussels sprouts but you chose potatoes well i don't think brussels sprouts can be stored for a long time right it's got me there you got me there so carrots potatoes root vegetables turnips i could have said turnips and been more culturally sensitive yeah um but maybe maybe i did think potatoes i don't know maybe it's just because i grow potatoes so i was thinking about building a root cellar you roped hail oh yeah they're very easy to grow wait really is it like just potatoes or you have like a little vegetable garden well the only things that are left now are are potatoes but i used to have okra peas i tried growing melons they didn't really grow very well the thing is not like a comfort thing or you just wanted your garden to look nice or it was like therapeutic because i've heard plants are therapeutic uh so there's all kinds of reasons but the short answer is i like gardening and i wanted to eat some of the food so peas is a good example of it's very hard to get fresh peas and i've grown tomatoes and stuff and lettuce and so like lettuce and stuff is fantastic because think about lettuce is like you buy some lettuce right but then first of all it's getting really expensive and secondly like for the first day you have fresh lettuce but then if you want to eat it like a week later it's going to be like not very good so what i really like about lettuce is you can just cut off as many leaves as you want to eat on a particular day and the lettuce will just keep growing [Music] yeah so what you don't have to harvest no you just you just snip whatever leaves you want it just keeps growing how long does it take to grow less probably like six weeks for it to be harvestable in some way and then it just keep it just hangs out for like three months and you have fresh lettuce whenever you want it it's great highly recommend it this is actually a life hack it's actually a life hack they have less that goes stale in my fridge because i'm like okay peeling it off the sphere of lettuce yeah i know that's not the name no sphere of lettuce sounds great so the other thing about potatoes is you just stick them in the ground and they just grow they just like keep growing you just like reach into the ground you just pull out a potato i know nothing about gardening okay i'm actually shocked right now oh yeah like you know you see an oak tree it takes 70 years to grow i'm just surprised that less takes a month yeah two weeks some of that stuff takes weeks oh i need to get i need to get some less yeah it's i highly recommend it the one thing is my lettuce started getting bitter like i don't know if you've had like bitter lettuce and i could never figure out why it was bitter and i couldn't make it kind of sweet so i've never had better or less that sounds like a big you issue are you sure you're not like eating some weird bitter you've had bitter less yeah kind of bitter has like a better taste to it maybe it is a problem and now you're frightening me no it was like fresh but it was just had this bitter taste to it oh okay and you just ate it you just kept eating it did which now i'm beginning to realize may have been a mistake you were like well you know i myself it might taste better mike could be in a [ __ ] less that tastes like piss and he'd be like well i group myself bought a petite fair enough yeah maybe i should have paused a little bit there i uh like did you did you put it in boiling water lettuce no i ate it raw i mean that's really yeah do you cook your lettuce yeah i thought you were supposed to boil it to get the insects off no you can wash it but but do you boil lettuce do you cook your lettuce usually you eat it in salad let us know why you buy it from the store i just assume because there's dart on it yeah it could have been a problem now that i think about it anyway i don't have lettuce anymore like i said all i've got left is potatoes and sweet potatoes the problem with sweet potatoes is that they are very big but don't taste very sweet feel like maybe your garden isn't really work like oh your sweet potatoes don't taste sweet your lettuce tastes better that's two big big big issues there well look you're proud of it you're proud of it so i'm look good on you for growing it but don't eat stuff that doesn't taste like that on the upside on the upside my peas are excellent like amazing like better than most of what i've tasted well you don't have your peas anymore yeah i mean because they're a winter crop so they're they're gone now oh they grow in the winter how do i get peas right now answer that and to read that riddle meet up there may be some kind of hydroponic sort of stuff where you can grow it in certain kinds of controlled environments that's also why peas are frozen right so if you like wanted to buy peas right now and you went to the grocery store you would not find fresh peas you don't see fresh peas at the grocery store you just see frozen peas so they freeze them okay i'm so stupid i didn't even realize this oh my god i'll never be a farmer man my ancestors are crying and rolling over in their bed well i didn't know any of this you know it's it's interesting that you mentioned that because there's actually an interesting theory that not really that scientifically valid i can go into the data if you really want to that people with adhd were like not farmers so there are some societies that had were more hunter-gatherers and those societies actually have a higher genetic predisposition for adhd so even if you're thinking about a hunter well if you think about a farmer they wake up at the same time they do the same damn thing every time all day wake up at 5 a.m they water this they do this they do this they do this they go to bed at the same time right same routine routine routine routine routine routine they never get bored they're happy yeah some people are and then you have hunters who are like out in the wilderness they're like thinking about this thing they're listening to the sound over here looking at this footprint over here they're smelling this thing oh there's a little bit of like fur over here and so they're like integrating a lot of stimuli and they don't need to be focused on one thing at the same time and in fact the most successful hunters were the ones whose attention could bounce all over the place and so there's some evidence that societies that have more hunter gatherer a greater amount of hunter gathering as opposed to farming have a higher genetic amount of predisposition towards adhd because it was actually more adaptive the problem is that there's larger studies where we look at that more closely and it turns out that that doesn't seem to be quite as simple as that or may not even be true but it's an interesting hypothesis that adhd is essentially an outgrowth of like variable attention in hunter-gatherer societies that's actually so interesting holy god it's actually so impressive how you bring it back around like i know i got sidetracked with the vegetable thing but like so i'm a hunter oh yeah that's why you're so successful as a streamer right so like so this is the other thing i am beginning to think also that adhd may be an adaptive advantage for content creation i actually agree with that um that's why i said i said i'm like why take why take adhd medication when you can let it out and be funny and like be all over the place and keep going i feel like that's that's that's something i always say i think my bpd and my adhd has helped me grow because i'm sure you know what bpd i feel like i can half the time i don't know who i am like i disassociate a lot because i see a person and i mimic them to fit in um so with streamers i feel like i can you know mimic not mimic but like see how they act and then act like them and fit in perfectly and i feel like that's what really helped me grow and like have kind of a foot in this industry yeah so it sounds like you can be what people need you to be yeah yeah well i feel like that's normal though like every you know i feel like even for like every friend group you're a different person well so this is the interesting thing so i think people with bpd may be particularly good at that right so everyone is going to adapt some but then sometimes you'll have people who like stick out like a sore thumb you know like they're just not able to adapt the other really interesting thing about adhd is there's studies that show that this is wild okay so people were looking at how often people have adhd and depression so if you have depression as a kid just toss out a number minx what percentage of people who you think have depression as a kid grow up to be diagnosed with adhd i'm setting you up i'm setting you up to it's two point seven percent three percent okay now hold on a second what percentage of kids with adhd grow up to have depression two percent fifty to seventy percent i debated you there that supposed to make sense huh how does that make sense it's fascinating so if you're a child with adhd the likelihood that you'll be depressed as an adult is between 50 and 70 but so people were trying to figure out if a kid has adhd and depression or do they just happen together or does one cause the other but kids with depression don't grow up to have adhd but kids with adhd grow up to have depression and this is really fascinating a big part of this is discordant relationships so when you're a kid with adhd at the age of seven and everyone's in recess is standing in line to get on the slide and when you have adhd and you can't stand in a line so you wander away and then you come back and you cut right because you were in line you were ahead of this kid and then you wandered away for a minute and now that kid is like second from the front and you step back in front of him and you're like this is my place in line and then you cause conflict so kids don't like kids with adhd they feel very lonely they're isolated they can't attend to conversations they can't pay attention so you know what kids end up doing [Music] they end up becoming funny they end up being the class clown because i don't have to know what's going on but if my mind is fast and i can make some fart joke or if i can fart in front of this teacher everyone will laugh and so kids are actually with adhd are very isolated growing up they have a lot of social problems and that's part of the reason they probably get depressed is adults because they don't they're it's difficult but what they what they do end up doing is being funny just like you minx right because you're very good at being oh there's always a win huh we're always looking at the wind side you might grow up alone might you know years of turmoil with no friends well look at me now really funny and a woman sorry that was a low blow i think women are funny i it's just i've seen comedians say that i just i'm a woman i can now now now i'm bottling it so we're gonna change back to adhd doc what how about that you just okay sure i didn't catch that i didn't quite follow but um yeah back to adhd so going back to diagnosis so remember there's personality diagnosis which takes a long time because we have to see fluctuations and then there are things like adhd so there are some diagnoses which you can do faster because they're essentially malfunctions so you can sort of like look at someone who's like bipolar has major depressive disorder and you can see like okay this is not how the brain is supposed to be working whereas the interesting thing about a personality disorder is that even though it causes them problems it's the way that their brain grew up like learning how to survive so for example people with bpd will have one of the features of it is a fear of abandonment and the reason for that is because oftentimes people with bpd like got abandoned in some way growing up so their brain is like this is bad let's make sure this never happens again we want to watch out for this and we need to be terrified of this and so that their brain forms with a fear of abandonment right that's not it's not a bug it becomes a feature so we need to protect ourselves from being abandoned because it hurt so damn much the last time we don't want it to ever happen again so then i have a because you know you've you've obviously you know your [ __ ] is there any way a bpd brain can stop because the most annoying thing is i am self-aware when it's happening and i'm trying to tell myself stop thinking this calm down so i can let me ask you a question mix do you think that personalities can change over the course of someone's life yes then the answer to your question is yes i completely agree with you right so the way that we perceive and behave can change and so the good news is that there is data that shows that bpd can essentially be cured like cure is like it's a weird word but essentially you can have sustained remission after a certain amount of like time and treatment or even stable relationships so people have done studies that show that 50 pro we don't 100 know about this but being in a stable relationship for two years can potentially not quite cure but essentially make it so that people no longer 50 of people no longer have bpd if they're in a stable relationship for two years now does that mean that you have to be in a relationship is that the only cure for bpd no so you can be in treatment and learn things like there are evidence-based treatments like dialectical behavioral therapy what are you looking for my phone i'm bowed down a little bumble if i knew that was the cure you would have got tinder so that that's where i i got it it's not just the cures this is epidemiologic data so people have done studies and taken people that have bpd and then no longer seem to have bpd and what changed they were in a stable relationship for two years but what we do know that you can do so this is a little bit tricky whereas i wouldn't say that finding a relationship is necessarily the cure to bpd but what you can do is do treatment like dialectical behavioral therapy so that's like it's a kind of therapy that's heavily influenced by mindfulness was is fascinating so there was a psychologist named marshall linahan who herself had bpd and what she was trying to figure out is like what worked for me became a psychologist was also very high functioning very successful and developed the best treatment for dp bpd on the planet which is dialectical behavioral therapy so that's what i would recommend if you you know want to get that diet sorry dialectical behavioral therapy and i can even explain to you kind of what it is and how it works yeah because i i i like at the time they sent me to a lot of therapy but it was like the exact therapy i was going for my depression where it felt like it didn't do a thing i didn't know there were like different types yeah if you could explain instead of me reading it off that'd be handy thank you so i'm gonna ask you a couple of like somewhat personal questions you don't have to offer a whole lot of detail it's going to be like more yes or no if you want to add color or explain what your experience is you can but you don't have to okay so sometimes people with bpd their way of thinking about something becomes very black and white and very rapidly and oftentimes completely black so is that something that you feel comfortable like can you just give us an example like it doesn't even have to be real but like does that happen to you where it consists of me like it'll be some small like like i'll be driving in the car i'll get a message that just upsets me and i'm like everything i'm doing today sucks because this is in my head for the right like and i'm like what's the point of being happy when this one thing has upset me or like evening and when people are like even when people are just late to something i'm like well now we can't plan efficiently and like it's ruined and it's like everything's just and i can't see the bright side okay perfect right can't see the bright side okay so it's ruined so when one bad things hap happens it's ruined period yeah right you can't see the bright side i couldn't set it better myself so what marshall in a hand did is she studied buddhism and she discovered a very interesting principle that is rooted in something called advaith vedanta which is non-dualism okay i know it sounds kind of weird we'll catch you up give me a second so essentially what she discovered is something that she translated into english is the dialectic which is that two things that are polar opposites can be true at the same time and once someone with bpd understands that and can live that they get a lot better so i'll give you an example i can be mad at you and still love you but someone with bpd can't hold both of those thoughts that's why it's so terrifying either you love me or you're mad at me and i can't have you ever being mad at me because that means you don't love me so it's ruined means uh you're late therefore it's ruined it's impossible for your late and we can still have we can still have a good time sure we're half an hour late but we can make the most of the next three hours that thought is very hard for people with ppd i know and it's pissing me off now because i'm literally thinking like someone didn't reply to my text for two days because they were busy and i'm like i'm done with this person yeah i'm like i'm like i'm like they can't even send me a message like i am completely done they're cut off and then they message me like i'm so sorry and i'm like oh you're fine and it's like why can i change from planning to cut them out forever to being like you're my best friend i love you yeah and not balance it yeah so so here's the thing here's the tricky thing about what dbt teaches people it's not balancing it it's not that one goes down and one comes up it's that both are true at the same time in their intensity so over time it will lead to balance but it's kind of this idea that like i don't know how else to say it it's just replacing in your mind so when your mind reacts to something it's never and it's always but yes right it's either or it can never be like two things like this person is mad at me and they love me like you can't say that that's annoying i'm aware of that i'm saying to you i'm aware of it so why at the time every time because i've had bbd for years why can't i stop and realize at the time why does it take the next day to be like oh actually cutting this person out my life and blocking them is not the solution it's so aggravating so i know i'm talking about my issue but it keeps happening a good excellent question so let me ask you a couple questions okay so what's different you said why can't i realize it until the next day right you said that you asked that question so let me ask you what's different between the day it happens and the next day my emotions are strong because i'm overthinking and they did something excellent right so 100 correct so this is where remember how you were saying that your stress levels i drew the stress graph and you're like no dr k that's wrong it's way higher and way lower so people have done studies this is really fascinating when you have someone who has bpd ability to their brains ability to experience negative emotion is way faster than a neurotypical brain so your ability to like for me to go to zero to 100 in terms of being pissed will take me like 60 seconds for someone with bpd it'll take like four i'm just making those numbers up i don't know what the exact numbers are but the ability for someone's brain with bpd to experience negative emotion is more rapid the other really really thing that just causes people to suffer a lot is the ability for the brain to calm down takes longer so not is it not only is it easier for you to feel negative emotion if you have bpd but it takes you longer to kind of like reconstitute so it'll take 24 hours instead of like two hours that's so annoying because that means like my brain is actually slower than others it's like why because i know like i should be able to because right now i'm thinking about stuff that i got mad about where i'm like why did i get mad about that or like even even times like i'm gonna have myself here my older sister upset me recently because she said something to my mom and i attacked my mom over it because i'm like why didn't you tell me this you're fake and then the next day i was like i love you i'm sorry i don't know why i did that and it's like yeah why do i even go for the kill when that person hasn't upset me yeah so that that's where that's what so if we talk about the treatment of dialectical behavioral therapy that's why mindfulness is such a big part of it so mindfulness is going to be one of the central techniques that can literally like train your brain like everyone's brain to be like emotionally a little bit more detached emotionally kind of calm down all right you you look like you're getting emotional a little bit now is it happening just slightly are you frustrated are you frustrated with yourself it's annoying because i'm talking about here but why can't my brain understand it when it's happening okay hold on a second so minx are you being black and white in the way that you judge yourself in this moment maybe say more what are you thinking about yourself because i can see oh like a lot of relationships i've ruined with it and talking about it it's just like different and easier to understand but then at the time it's like how is my brain so [ __ ] dumb and slow that i can't process and realize how normal the situation is instead of blowing up and ruining everything yeah so that in and of itself so makes it's gonna sound kind of weird but i want you to take a step back from that conclusion because that conclusion is black and white that you're [ __ ] dumb and slow because you're neither dumb nor are you slow what you have to understand about this is what i've come to understand about bpd is the reason your brain is like that is because it's like that to protect you because there was probably a time in your life that if it did not think like that you would have been screwed so bpd is like your guard dog and now what's happened is that you know people have been trying to break into your house for so long that any stranger that comes over it starts barking so you're not busted you're not broken you're an amazing person this is just what happens this is your karma it's your karma that you grew up in a particular circumstance where you have these particular ways that you're wired that let's remember makes you more successful at streaming has allowed you to come to la has allowed you to fit in to the stream or culture and causes you to suffer right that both of these things can be true that this can i wouldn't quite call it a gift but let's call it that it can some things it can do good for you and some things it can't now i'm having trouble reading what's going on in your brain are you no discarding everything that i'm saying no i i'm i'm listening and it does make me like it it i i do like agree with saying like i that's why i say i try to call it gift because like half of my viral clips that happen is when i feel like a trigger go in my brain and i'm like instead of ending and being upset act into that emotion and make it a character and it's like but it's also like turmoil when you're alone and it's like 100 percent and it make it feels like i'm [ __ ] mimicking my own issue and 100 like you know you dissociate you can't tell what's real and what's fake yeah so i i think it's this is the real challenge of people that i've worked with who have bpd is that it is so responsible for their success and causes them to suffer immensely right like sure you're successful but boy have you paid a price for it exactly and exactly like you said with all the like darkness like i i i call my mom all the time like every day and i tell her like how sad i am and then she'll be like but look how much like you've done and how much you've grown you're in la you're doing dreams and it just makes the thing because it's either black or white and it's just so annoying because this is the first time i can properly talk about it and it's like i can walk to advantage but it sucks so [ __ ] bad when you're 100 yeah i don't want to like i don't want to be with people because if it acts up i just hurt them yeah that sounds like an impossible situation that you can't win because on the one hand you don't want to be on alone but on the other hand you don't want to ruin your relationships if it gets out of control you feel like you're not in control so almost to protect them you have to be alone and then you're signing yourself up for being alone and suffering even even small things like if i like have a plan and i'm like because i sleep early especially with my boxing like i had a plan for a friend to come over and they were like an hour and a half late and i ruined the whole night because i'm like we waste that hour and a half and now i have to sleep in an hour when we could have two and a half hours and they didn't get why i was upset and i'm like why can't i just tell you the reason instead of being mad and sulky and it's annoying because i can talk about now but i can't talk about at the time so this is so i would you know if this is this is what i feel confident about minx is that dbt generally speaking helps people a lot who are who struggle with the things that you struggle with and what it literally will do is like so this is why the mindfulness component is such a big piece of it so there's a lot going on here so would it help you for me to talk through [Music] what i think it could help you with yeah can i think for a second and compose my thoughts yeah i know i may have to whip out the ipad again okay you know what actually when i cry it brings color to my face and i'm kind of feeling cute right now usually i'm like a walking corpse we got a little blush going on natural blush too there's there's the humor there's the adhd there's the leaning into it there's the entertainer right look at you looking at the dialectic now bring some color in hey yeah man yeah i'm like making my cheekbones pop too i'm starting to feel like a little model look at you rocking it um sorry you just threw me off which i'm not upset about i really appreciate but i was just thinking a little bit about okay let me just think for a second okay yes take your time i'll sing a little song with chat come by and lord come by yeah [Music] i'm not singing christian tunes i don't know why we're back into that uh i'm christian anymore i'm agnostic so let's think through so let me just understand this okay so it seems like you're very frustrated with yourself for losing control yes um you're also not frustrated but i get the sense of almost like you feel kind of powerless that it's like either or like yeah either you're on and you're streaming and successful and fun and happy and or you're alone which we haven't really talked too much about i don't know that we really need to but and then in in the loneliness there's suffering there's you know kinds of stuff then there's also okay so let's like think through this from a very basic level so the first thing to understand is that we're talking about treatment so here's the way that i would think about treatment for someone like you this is basically how i think about everyone with bpd so the first is learning particular skills that literally like work on your brain and correct that emotional when i say sensitivity i don't mean like oh you're sensitive like i mean like literally like your neurons are like twitchy and their ability to get feel anger or upset or things like that is like very very quick okay so you can learn certain grounding techniques i'ma teach you one today okay that will hopefully if you practice it because it takes practice it'll help you if we if we think about today versus tomorrow what's different that your emotions have calmed down it'll help you calm your emotions and then if you calm your emotions it'll be easier to realize so this meditation technique won't help you realize it won't make you realize anything all it'll hopefully do is counteract that rapidity which your brain gets upset with and also the length at which your brain stays upset okay yeah so we got to help you in the moment okay second thing so we're going to start with like meditation at the top second thing there are going to be things that you are frustrated with yourself you're going to be frustrated with yourself because you have bpd there are the things that you bla why can't i dot dot dot dot dot that makes you lose confidence in yourself right because you think you're busted on the inside if you lose confidence with yourself you become more vulnerable to the opinions of others and then the love and affection of other people becomes more important to you because you don't believe it in here that combined with the brain's itchiness creates like a bad scenario you see that like if i can't love myself i need other people to love me if they don't answer my text message because they're the they're going to be the ones they're the ones that love me then like it triggers the whole thing so the other thing that you need to do is like forgive yourself for being who you are because this is all a part of your journey minx i believe that 100 even if you think about if you never had bpd we wouldn't be talking about this we wouldn't be streaming online right now a thousand people 10 000 people 20 000 people 50 000 people would not watch this and there are thousands of people just like you out there who may not even realize what they've got sure it took you nine months to get diagnosed you got diagnosis think about all the people out there that have no idea they're just they understand this they live it every single day but they have no [ __ ] clue and so there is a karma to the work that we're doing here there's like an important that's actually something i always remind myself like because i know bpd is hard to diagnose and it can be misdiagnosed so many times where i'm grateful that i know what the root of the issue is and that there is ways to work on it like like you said the therapy which i'm definitely gonna look into that yeah so so that so the second thing is you got to learn how to forgive yourself for having bpd in the first place next thing to do is understand the origins of it so understand because remember this is your brain's way of protecting you it's the way that your brain like it's not it's not busted that's what's so tricky about a personality disorder versus like something like depression if there's a neurochemical imbalance we can give you a pill to correct that neurochemical imbalance it's actually a malfunction of the brain whereas narcissistic personality disorder borderline personality disorder these are not malfunctions of the brain they're adaptations of the brain that now start to cause you problems so you have to understand where that came from you have to understand why your brain evolved to be this way and the truth is it's not your fault you're not like fundamentally busted it learned somewhere along the way that we need these techniques it's like i don't know you know what games you play or if you play games but i almost think about personality disorders as like blood magic you know what blood magic has have you played any games with blood magic i've not played games with blood magic actually so like this this is this idea where you've got like mana right and you use mana to cast spells but then there's blood magic where you use your life essence to cast spells and so everything that every step forward comes at a cost to you and i almost think about personality disorders is like the blood magic of psychiatry i'm a [ __ ] wizard is what you're saying you are a wizard right but you pay the price for it each time you cast a spell each time you work your magic it comes with a [ __ ] price but now that makes bpd so much cooler now i'm like well you know yeah when you see that you put it into that little perspective and i'm like i'm pretty cool my bpd you're right yeah i mean like i think that's the thing about blood magic is that sounds cool when you play it in a video game sucks to actually be the wizard who's like losing a piece of their life force right that's true but i think it is useful to understand the origins of why you are the way that you are and then ultimately i think it comes back to meditation so once you do all that stuff and you also develop like coping skills and things like that once you come back to it i think that there's almost like a spirituality to it that at the end of the day when i work with people who are like really i can't say the word cured because who knows how they're doing now but people who get so much better to where they no longer if they went to a psychiatrist and they put them through the diagnostic process of bpd they would not qualify that's what we can say confidently is that there is like almost like a spirituality to it and this is what i think marshall linehan kind of stumbled upon is that the world is fundamentally not black or white like if you think about you said that you know the potatoes or my lettuce is bitter or you know the sweet potatoes are sweet why are you coming back to play it was doc i said nothing about your potatoes i'm just i talk [ __ ] about your life no no i'm not very stereotypical over here aren't we miss murder no no no no no no no let me finish please makes so like at the end of the day not all sweet potatoes are going to be sweet right some of them are going to be sweeter than others and that's just life that at the end of the day like even beyond dbt and dialectics and being able to hold two opposites to be true that's just what life is that life is ups and life is downs and even then if you really go far into spirituality you can start to do things like develop a detachment where you can acknowledge that did i want this thing yes did i want my friend to show up on time and could we have had two and a half hours of fun yes but they showed up an hour late and so the most i can get is an hour and a half of fun and now i sort of have not really the choice because we can't really control it we make it sound like a choice it's really not you know it with practice and with dedication and with effort i can still enjoy the next 90 minutes and this is something that i've seen a lot with like you know people like that sounds kind of weird but some of the most inspiring moments in medicine for me have been people who have been diagnosed with cancer so it's like they have a limited time on this earth left and like you know some of them really learn to make the most of it and like the last year or two years of their life like is there suffering and awfulness absolutely but there's also like beauty and that like that's what life is and they serve as an inspiration to people around them and then i also hear really bizarre things which i still have trouble accepting which is like cancer is the best thing that ever happened to me people will actually say that right usually these are people that are in remission because you know but that like cancer helps them realize what life is and like stuff like that i mean people will say things like that it sounds crazy it is it is but it does it does make sense and going back to you said something there where it was like the last 90 minutes is what matters and it's like that's another thing that affects the because you said you know a new day's new emotions and that's true i restart but then you know the guilt that comes with it because i'm like i'll think exactly what you said now with that nine minutes i have it in my head the next day i'm like why did you have to be like that and be so moody when you could have enjoyed the time that you had with them and then i feel worse the next day because i just have a guilt building up in me and it's like damn you were so angry then when you could have you didn't even have to be angry just neutral you didn't have to so makes that's the tricky thing so that is the same thing though because that's the black and white because the next day instead of enjoying today you're ruining today by thinking about yesterday and so the cycle perpetuates so that's where you really have to learn how to forgive yourself because if you can learn how to forgive yourself you can also learn how to forgive your friend for the 60 minutes they're late and enjoy the 90 minutes it actually starts with the next day not not the 90 minutes it starts with hey this is the way that i am whether you believe in god or karma or entropy or chance or whatever this is the way that the universe has made me right i am a i'm a i'm the this is the fruit that has been born from the tree of my life and this is what it is it may not be the sweetest fruit but that's okay right so it starts by like forgiving yourself like really and like the four components are like learning how to manage your emotions in the moment learning how to forgive yourself for not managing the emotions in the moment learning the origins of why your brain developed to be this way and ultimately like almost take a spiritual perspective and recognize that this is all what's supposed to happen and that despite all of the suffering that you have you can grow from it you can learn from it you can appreciate life so much more through these experiences you can help the world and make them a better place and your community absolutely loves you and that's where like because like sure you're here with blood magic and you're suffering but you've enriched so many people around you so you suffer and you make the world a better place you have fun and you suffer and you are i'm sure frustrating to deal with by some of your friends at times and an absolute joy to have in their lives god i [ __ ] hope so i get these [ __ ] food all the time they better i better be a [ __ ] joy in their life yeah and that's where you may be getting them food but bribery only works so far and at some point [Music] did you give that to boa bribery always works okay we will not get you very far bribery will always work okay [ __ ] love some bribery some bribery on it wednesday evening is it wednesday yeah there we go knowing the dates look at me how you holding up minx good really good actually this was not how i expected to go i was expecting more to be like funny the whole time but it's actually been really helpful yeah i i'm noticing that maybe if we pause for a second you're feeling conflicting things now uh i'm feeling like you might be correct actually right so that's good right so this is where like this is just what you have to learn and the cool thing is like right now you're feeling those emotions i actually see you doing it right now i see you feeling the emotions and feeling them intensely but also not losing control of them and it's it's what you're doing right now is hard it's to be commended thank you thank you could you get a four seven in chat please if we commending it i'd like uh wait that's not they won't what that i don't know i just did what you did i didn't know what you're doing it almost happened i made 007. there they go what does that mean they're commending me for my bravery and dealing with my emotions do you not have a dude are you just seeing oh seven are you not seeing the emote yeah i'm just saying go seven okay so they're it's a salute they're doing a salute okay well i i salute you i suppose i just feel weird saluting people because i don't know how to do it properly i think you did it fantastically thank you okay beautiful psy you want to learn a little meditation technique man i've tried meditation so many times and i'm like oh that wa yeah make me better already i'll sit there cross-legged and i'm like why am i not feeling better i'm with you yeah those those meditation techniques suck can i try to teach you something else yes okay so hmm i felt confident in what i was going to teach you but i wonder okay now we're just going to do this all right so i'm going to teach you so i'm going to share with you a phrase in english okay so have you heard the phrase this too shall pass yes my mother says this to me every day i call her and does that upset you no it's just comforting at this point i used to upset me as a kid i'm like okay stop but now hearing it from a distance i'm like you're right this too shall pass so i can't tell if that means that this is the right thing to teach you or the wrong thing to teach you but let's stick with it for now okay so and so what i'm going to teach you is a really simple technique so if you look at the the sections of your fingers okay so like you see these like you've got three on each finger so i want you to start with this one the middle one of your ring finger okay put your and then what i want you to do is we're gonna go up to the tip out to the side to the pinky down to the middle good and then down to the bottom good and then across this way good and then across this way and then across this way and we're gonna go up we're gonna go up we're going to go across down and then back to where we started middle of the ring finger so you see we're making a loop so we're kind of going like that and we're making like kind of a loop you see that yes so there's 12 there are 12 of these so 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12. and then back to the center so what i want you to do the next time you're feeling upset we're going to practice now the next time you can't let something go okay what i want you to do is do 12 rounds close your eyes take a deep breath and do 12 rounds of this too shall pass and do one breath with each one and what i really want you to focus on is the sensation across your fingers of just touching touching and then like so does that sort of make sense we're gonna do like you can take a deep breath in you're gonna say this too shall pass and then you're gonna move on to the next one no i actually like this way i never even thought i like damn i actually like this way because i feel like like when i get anxious i like will scratch my palm a lot or something but this is more like a chill way and it also makes me feel like i'm in tokyo ghoul so becky so let's let's do it together okay so okay do you did you did you get the sequence i know it's kind of confusing so we're going to start middle oh okay yep and then show me what's next so yeah so we go down and then out oh down and out i thought it was up and out okay down down right then out to the pinky and then up the pinky good and then this way and then this way right and then this way and then down two good and then three like and then back to the center right good uh yeah don't skip the pinky the middle pinky i skipped it that was confusing because okay i'm kind of adhd too okay so there should be so just touch each of them 12 times i mean sorry they touched each other once and that'll be 12 rounds good very good so then the middle good down back towards the middle finger good and then and then cross over perfect okay so we're really going to focus on that tactile stimulation so you can take if you this is the other thing the more upset you are you don't have to do one breath with each one if you're upset you can do it super fast this two shall pass this two shall pass this two shall pass this two shall pass this to pass this two shall pass this two shall pass this too shall pass this too shall pass this should show this [ __ ] fast okay and then slow it down okay this too shall pass way i like this this is very comforting maybe it's because my mom always says it reminds me of home but it's also like fixing my nail digging thing it's like a mix of both i've never heard of this two shall pass two shall pass this two shall pass this two shall pass this two shall pass this two shall pass this two shall pass this two shall pass good okay now you can work your way up to doing it nine times you can do this when you're upset but ideally you want to do 9 rounds or 108 breaths or 108 this too shall pass okay so you can even keep track if you want to get things super complicated you may lose this because of adhd but you can even keep track on this hand so as i do 12 over here i move down here oh no no shot i'm gonna count and be able to do that okay don't worry about it you know i got a small frontal lobe i got epilepsy well that's true did you know that people always think i'm joking when i say it people with epilepsy have a small a smaller frontal lobe that like hinders their decisions yeah people with adhd have that too so oh great so you're saying i'm a double small brain huh no i think that's probably me i guess do you mind if i ask how old you are i'm 25. okay so your frontal lobe will continue to grow until you're 30 or 32. so things could get better for you even just on their own let's have our fingers crossed because she better be grown man i'm missing a big part of my brain right now do you have any questions about the meditation technique do you understand it no i actually do understand i like it i thought you were going to make me like crisp cross my legs and like close my eyes at home in silence for like 30 minutes no silence is terrible so when you're way better so here's the thing for you mix you need activity and grounding for meditation what you're you don't silence is just going to be filled with your negative thoughts like if you try to like sit and meditate when you're struggling like you need you have so much energy in the mind right like that's what makes you so damn successful is you've got like so much energy and so what you need to do is direct that energy because when you get upset with yourself it's just bouncing around in your head and creating thought after thought after thought after thought and it ramps up and ramps up and ramps up and ramps up this sushapot boom boom boom boom as fast as you can go like a machine gun and then slow down you know what you said bouncing and that's actually how i explain it when i'm angry you know the windows logo when it hits the corners oh yeah it feels like that's what's like in my head ticking it's like boom and every time it hits it takes me like it makes me angrier and angrier and angrier over a small situation i don't know if i agree with small right because the whole point is that it's not small to you it's it's it's black and white and i just see it it's big to me but it'll be a small so if you stop seeing it as small because that's the that's the black and white you see that because if you view it as a small situation that means that it's insignificant and you're so stupid for getting caught up in it that's the no it's important you were really looking forward to this and your friend was an hour late and it's okay to be upset by that right a very smart person huh very understanding huh you you very understanding guy man saying my thoughts before i can even think them out here i yeah i mean i i think cut yourself a little slack thanks seriously you deserve it thanks thank you and now i've gone and messed it all up again this too shall i see i'm not even mad now this is just a comforting cry it's more like a comforting one good well any thoughts are i mean i feel like this is a good place to stop for today in general like i think we've covered a lot and yeah you know i i don't want to forget what we learned in the first half do you want to do you have any thoughts or questions um i don't i don't really have any questions i just feel more like a this was a dice it's because it's you know like you you have therapy alone private thing where it's nice to be able to talk about it and like the safe environment try to be very sweet where i was just like not expecting to open up so much but yeah you'd be very nice too so i thought we were going to do adhd lecturing [ __ ] but there's adhd we screwed from [ __ ] lettuce to [ __ ] grasp you [ __ ] you can't you can't blame me for this no it was like growing up and asking about your lettuce you're bitterless by the way and also there was a point where you spoke about like you did an analogy and you were like not all sweet potatoes are sweet and you were really into it but i wanted to roast you and i'm like man that's just your [ __ ] sweet potatoes you literally like said earlier sometimes you're not sweet i'm like i think this is an analogy like hitting close home i've never had a sweet potato that was not sweet okay that's just you and your strange ass garden okay yeah maybe with my bitter lettuce and unsweet sweet potatoes i don't really know what i'm growing here roast away you know that only makes it sweeter [Laughter] okay well minx i wish you all the best good luck um you know thank you one very concrete recommendation i would recommend you kind of look into dbt a little bit more they're also groups which can be really really good that they'll teach you like the skills and stuff yeah so you can just like kind of look in your area if you're uh and you know if you have any questions or anything like that just dm me okay perfect thank you for having me on i appreciate it thank you very much take care thanks for having me bye bye okay so that was that that changed rapidly but we talked about a lot of important stuff um yeah you know it's interesting because i think mental health is like we kind of think about it so uh in isolation right we think about adhd or we think about bpd or we think about adderall or not adderall or like you know medication or not medication whereas like the truth is like it's so much more integrated than that and the people who tend to do well i think are the ones that are really able to take an integrated non-isolating approach which is part of what i dislike about the way that this profession is going so like one thing that we see a lot in the united states which which is not i mean it's good for a lot of reasons but has like some serious cost to it is the separation of medication from psychotherapy so a lot of times people will have a psychiatrist who prescribes medications and someone else who does therapy which sort of makes sense i mean there's a lot of good reasons that we do that because there's a shortage of prescribers for example so like you know you can just treat more people as a society if you have someone kind of prescribing and someone else doing therapy so there's like some like you know public health access to healthcare kind of issues there that sort of makes sense for that also you don't sometimes the medication is pretty simple and it's not necessarily that integrated but i think you know one of the things that i've come to really appreciate is that taking care of your mental health and like being happy or healthy is not just medications it's not just therapy it's like the whole shebang right it's like learning skills to calm down your emotional mind and i don't say that as an indictment i mean when your mind is ramped up your brain is ramped up and it's triggered in a particular way and your neurons are just you know you get that kind of like thoughts bouncing around in your head you need some something to decompress that in the moment but that's not enough right then you also have to understand okay how did my brain get to here how did my mind get to here why do i perceive the world in this way and that's what i really like about some of these you know deeper kinds this deeper sort of work is you start to recognize where your patterns come from and once you recognize where your patterns come from then the cool thing is that that forgiveness becomes so much easier because the whole thing is like we just think that we're idiots and we're busted right like oh my god like why am i so stupid no it's like you became that way because it actually served a very important function for you and then what we also have to do is think a little bit about the consequences of things like bpd and adhd so this is part of the reason why i think people with adhd grow up to have depression is because they like don't know how to properly mourn their like negative experiences right because when you when you're a kid like this is what's so hard is that being adhd makes you fail at being normal so you're smart and you know you're smart but you can't do what other kids can do and so like that consequence or that conclusion that like i just can't be normal like there's something wrong with me that seed is what really grows into depression and so this is where there's not just the the the adhd itself right there's not just like the attention problems and things like that there's also like the consequences of having lived with it which require another like layer of work but the good news is that you know some people may think oh my god this is so overwhelming like how am i supposed to do all this stuff and the but the good news is that if you're kind of feeling like you're stuck in life and you haven't done any of these things and you feel like okay i'm operating at like 40 of my potential the good news is that the more things that you haven't done like you can get 20 from meditation 20 from self-forgiveness and 20 from like you know learning like organizational skills for adhd and you can get to 100 that's the real thing that i've seen as a provider like as a treater as a psychiatrist is that there's a like people you will be amazed at what people are capable of you'll be amazed at what you're capable of and like actually getting there because the truth of the matter is that most of us haven't done most of this stuff and there's a lot to be done and you just gotta get started and then it'll like happen like i give it like three to six months for each of those things and then a year to 18 months from now you will be in a completely different place you
