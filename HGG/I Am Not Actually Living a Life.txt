just get rid of it right just have a positive mind and it doesn't work for you then you despair even further so what on earth is going on and like how do we get out of this so i don't have a life warning this text probably this text probably the most pathetic thing you've ever read i'm a 24 year old woman i'm a high school dropout i don't have a job i don't have any friends i've i never had a relationship and all that loneliness is indescribable i've always felt out of place and i've always been a weird kid i wasn't the brightest in the school i used to skip school for months i just wanted waited until my parents went to work and then came back home and spent time in my room i basically wasted all my life being isolated stuck inside my room due to my depression and severe social anxiety and i was just indifferent about my future although i did have some plans or whatever but that was stupid i don't have good memories i have never had some amazing adventures with my friends i wasn't happy and i'm unhappy now all i do every day is just scroll the internet or watch dumb videos nothing happens in my life i tried to find a job but i usually just just chicken out and go back to my room trying to escape sheer anxiety my family is so upset with me i don't even want to start with this one i don't see a future my for myself i did go to a therapist she gave me antidepressants and told me to find a job but i'm still rotting in my room i don't know what's wrong with me it's not a life i feel so hopeless and defeated i don't think i'll ever catch up on life and the most painful thing is that i'm actually a fun person and there are things i'd love to do i want to see places i want to travel i want to have a healthy social life i want to have a life but i simply can't can't do even a small step so sometimes we find ourselves in a situation where we're in our twenties and we've got nothing going for us high school dropout didn't even finish school don't have a job don't have friends never had a relationship so romance isn't working well professions isn't going well academics aren't going well and furthermore our health isn't good right because there's like crippling depression and anxiety like really bad anxiety and so we find ourselves in this situation where like nothing's going our way there's like literally not a single point of light in our life and we're 24 we realize this and like we don't even know like where to start like where do you even start in this kind of situation and this is what's like especially crippling about this is that if we look at this what's the tone right like who does who do you think this person blames who is to blame here i simply can't do one step we feel defeated and the challenge here is that sometimes when we're in this situation like we have depression anxiety the internet or people will tell us like myself included go get therapy right so we'll say like oh like this is a problem like what's the diagnosis here you're depressed oh right so you're like you do depression anxiety okay great go go to therapy and then we do that and you get antidepressants and you're told to find a job and then you're still rotting in your room so like the challenge here is that when you're faced with the situation like there are some things that are supposed to be the right answer and what on earth do you do if you do the right answer and it still doesn't work like then what then the real hopelessness sets in right then it's like then i want you all to think about what effect this has on the mind if someone tells you oh look this is the right answer like you need to get go see a therapist and find medication you go go to a therapist you find medication you do the right thing and it still doesn't work who's to blame even even more you right because this works for so many people therapy and antidepressants help people who are depressed but they don't help me so now you're like sol right like now it's like now you're busted on such a fundamental level that even like medical professionals aren't able to help you and so when you're faced in this situation you're kind of screwed like you don't even like you don't know where to start you don't know how to make friends you don't have social skills you don't know how to like put together a resume like you haven't even finished school and like and then what's really painful about this is that despite the fact that you're struggling with all this stuff you still want what life has to offer right like you recognize that life is supposed to be more than this you want to have a healthy social life you want to have a relationship you want to travel you want to do fun things you want to do more than just spend all day on the internet but where on earth do you even start and it can feel so overwhelming like it's a problem it's a really challenging problem to solve but if you're going to therapy and you're getting antidepressants anyway and you're still stuck then it really feels bad so this is where like if we really want to understand this we've got to kind of start by kind of start at the top so the first thing we're going to share a little bit of research okay first thing to understand is that if you are defeated in your mind the chances of success are going to be very low right so like basically like it's been my experience that you fail when you give up that's the most important variable in terms of whether you succeed or you fail now what does success mean what does failure mean like that's a whole separate philosophical question but in essence if you give up then it's very hard to win now the challenge is that telling you that doesn't actually fix anything right actually if you pay attention what happens is you blame yourself even more because oh all i have to do is hope and if i could hope then i would be successful but busted me i can't even hope my despair is so bad like i can't even hope i can't be motivated i can't stay positive like because my i'm so busted i can't even do that right so like do you see how like no matter what we say like you're always gonna be the problem like it's always gonna be a deficiency in you that's what your mind is gonna tell you that's what we have to get rid of now if i tell you have to get rid of it then you can't get rid of just get rid of it right just have a positive mindset and it doesn't work for you then you despair even further so what on earth is going on and like how do we get out of this you'll see this it's like a really tricky thing that the mind does so let's understand a couple of things so i'm going to ask you all a question who what what has to happen for a child to drop out of high school right like think look at this i just waited until my parents i used to skip school for months what has to be possible for a child to skip skip school no bullying bullying doesn't work bullying is not what allows a child to drop out lack of support right so like i don't know i mean like i was i don't know if this applies to y'all i don't know it depends on your upbringing but this should tell you the difference there's no way that i would have been able to drop out there's no freaking way that my parents would have allowed me to drop out of school so the first thing to understand is that if you're going nowhere in life you've got to start by distributing the responsibility and really attributing stuff to where it belongs so i'm going to give you guys just a simple example of this if i accept all of the blame for everything in my life on me let's acknowledge for a moment that like there's got to be some stuff that i can't control right but when i accept responsibility for that i'm accepting responsibility for something that i have no control over therefore i'm doomed to failure like you know if i if i accept responsibility for the fact that there's only one moon in the sky i'm setting myself up for despair and failure because i'm fundamentally the things in your life that you can control and things in your life that you can't control and the first thing to understand if you are in a despairing mindset is actually like correctly attributing where the blame goes because then what happens instead of blaming yourself for everything you can only you're only going to blame yourself for what you're truly responsible for so this is a kind of situation where if you're abusive to yourself you have to learn like self-love and what's the first step of learning self-love the first step of learning self-love is like acknowledging that other people may have had a hand in this too because if you're beating yourself if you're snatching away all of the mistakes of other people and taking them no no it's all me it's all me it's all me it's all me my parents aren't responsible at all if you're snatching away all of that responsibility it's gonna take your it's gonna like elevate your despair right because then you've screwed up your life in so many different dimensions so the first thing to recognize is that you know if you skipped school for months like how did your parents let you do that if you dropped out of high school like you can't drop out of high school without your parents being okay with it in some way and that's just the start of it second thing to consider is like how many friends did you have growing up what did your parents teach you about meeting new people and making new friends did they teach you how to make friends did they demonstrate how to make friends did you all go and socialize as a family with other people and meet new families did you meet new kids right so you look at the rest of the world and you look at all the people who are the haves and you're a have not and i think what we don't realize we we attribute these things to like motivation but the truth of the matter is like how does a human being learn anything it's through like observation even the language that i'm using how did you learn to speak english like you didn't try like people around you just started speaking english well maybe english is your second language because we have a large international audience but take your language of choice right spanish dutch whatever and so like we just learned this kind of stuff and this is the thing that we don't that a lot of people don't realize is like social skills even things like discipline waking up on time showering every day and things like that we're like we're taught right this kind of behavior is modeled for us it's part of the reason why religion is so like inherited right so like if you grow up in a particular region religion if you have you know if you're of your entire social circle or southern baptists and you grow up in that household you don't have a random chance to end up as any religion it's not like the all random mode in a video game like you're going to grow up southern baptists a decent chance right you're not going to grow up baha'i so this is where the first thing that you've got to realize is that a lot of the things that you struggle with are things that people are explicitly taught or modeled one of one of those two things so were you was there good modeling about forming new relationships did your parents expose you to new social situations and new people did you go to parties with people that you didn't know did you go to barbecues did you go to picnics did you go to church events did you go to these things where you met new kinds of people did they show you did your dad or mom you know meet people and then like because i remember like this happened for me right so we used to travel a lot growing up and i saw my dad make small talk with people he would make small talk with randos right and i would feel super awkward and he'd be like this is my son i'd say hi i'd feel super awkward but i saw him do it over and over and over again and then sometimes the parent the person that they would i would talk to you would interact with me so there's all kinds of stuff that we're supposed to be taught like how do you put together a resume how do you apply for a job like you know even think about your own parents and did your parents were they sort of professionally motivated did they like go through a series of negotiations when they got a job offer how many jobs did they consider how often did they move jobs what were you taught was it intrinsic in your household that if a job is not good you should go search for something better there are all kinds of things that we are instilled with and this is why you get sort of like you know i went to medical school i want to say 20 or higher 30 40 of my class in medical school had at least one parent who was a doctor do you think we're genetically better at medicine of course not there's no such thing it's all upbringing so the first thing that you've got to do is acknowledge that all this isn't your fault not all of it like are you responsible for some of it sure but especially like if you're if you were six years old and you didn't have any friends that has nothing to do with you that has everything to do with your circumstances every year that goes by you take a little bit more responsibility and a little bit more responsibility but even then the people who have a vivid social life at the age of 24 were the ones who were taught how to socialize and modeled socialization right so if you weren't taught those things it's like you're blaming yourself for not speaking english and you grew up in like you know india where there's sri lanka where there's like no one speaking english and then you're beating yourself up for not speaking english the problem is that we don't really like think about this right so especially when depression starts to kick in it it inflates self-blame so like what does this do so the first thing is that if you can actually go through this and acknowledge this for yourself it's gonna change the way that you talk to yourself and this is where there's like one or two like things that i kind of want to point out to y'all but my family is so upset with me so i don't even want to start with this one so this is the kind of thing where sometimes we have to be super careful because our family will teach us our self-talk where do we get our self-talk we get it from the way that we're talked to so if your family blames you for this situation if your family is like you need it just fix it just fix it just fix it just fix it without how can we help you know that's very very dangerous so what you've got to essentially do is start by acknowledging that all of this isn't your fault is some of it your fault absolutely but if you weren't taught how to make friends if you were allowed to drop out of high school that in turn like going to high school is where you start to self-regulate in terms of sleep going to sleep on time making your assignments get done by a particular time you know like it's where you learn how to be an efficient procrastinator you learn all these things you're forced to learn these things through high school and if you don't have that opportunity like your your brain just isn't put through that exercise regimen and you're not going to learn some of these fundamental skills because like the whole point of high school is they force you to do it book reports aren't optional you got it the book report is due on friday you got to do it you start on thursday at 2 pm sure you read through the book you get the cliff notes and then you start writing it at 10 pm and then you finish at 2 a.m and you turn it in the next day that's how you learn how to do like the you know a decent minimal kind of job that's a very important skill at life right is being able to do good enough and if you are deprived of these opportunities if there wasn't enough parental structure and support for you to go to school then like you know you're not going to learn this stuff it's not like we're you know if you think about human beings like human beings aren't born with the instinct of productivity like animals are born with the ability to like instinctually swim and run and stuff like that like you know you give birth to an impala on the serengeti and then paula knows how to run it's like out of the womb for 30 seconds and it's running human beings we're not taught like we have to be taught this stuff like a six month old isn't capable of anything it can't put together a schedule it doesn't know how to go to work on time it doesn't know like how to set healthy technology like think about it it's completely it can't even feed itself and so the whole point is that all this crap that we assume is intrinsic about human beings is not actually intrinsic it's taught once you realize that you don't deserve quite as much blame as you give yourself that's a really important piece and once you realize that that sure some of this is my fault but a lot of it isn't then your self-talk can change right did i do a bad job yes but let's be honest i kind of did okay but i was dealt a crappy hand of cards in life once you're able to say that to yourself that's where forgiveness comes in the ability to forgive yourself and once you start to forgive yourself once you start to cut yourself some slack and once you start to put less pressure on yourself then a lot of things can change and this is where i want to just show you all kind of flash to another post real quick dr k what exactly exactly what actions do i take to change my life and this is where we get caught up in the actions right i would like to change the following not having friends not being independent staying shy not having freedom being in the house etc etc not having much power oh my parents being controlling what exactly what actions do i take to change these most people would say just get a hobby or go out but what if i'm terrified of it this is the key thing logically i know it won't be that terrifying but i just can't do it the problem here is not what actions you take the problem here is the mind that takes the actions so when you look at your life and nothing is going well you don't have friends you don't have a job you just dropped out of high school you've never been in a relationship fixing each and every one of these problems is absolutely overwhelming you get into like how are you supposed to catch up can't so what do you actually do about it what you've got to do is change your mind change your thinking how do you change your thinking that's what we just walked through so oddly enough the first step is blame so depression is anger turned against the self that's a very old i think freudian conception of depression all of your anger is directed you pull it away from your parents and you will all point it in here so now what you first thing that you've got to do is like accountability needs to be like more evenly spread because you're not responsible for everything like it's crazy like you can't be responsible for everything in your life dropping out of high school only happens with parental support they have to allow it being able to skip school for months like what there was never a parent teacher conference they didn't see your grades they didn't like realize they never asked you how's your homework going you know their parents have to be and that too may not necessarily have been their fault in the sense that if they had to work or had other kinds of problems or had health issues or whatever like we're not necessarily blaming them for them we're not blaming in terms of like ah you did this to me so we're not sort of saying you need to be resentful and angry and stuff like that we just need to acknowledge that sometimes like crap happens in life and that's because there's a confluence events where something kind of slips through the cracks and if your parents were too busy to do this stuff or if they were never taught how to do this stuff and they had to kind of model through and struggle and stuff like that that's actually all okay too but it ain't your fault so the first thing isn't is a distribution of responsibility acknowledging that not everything in your life is actually your fault and once you start to do that you can start to change a little bit of your despair you can change the way that you think you can change the way that you talk to yourself and about yourself because then if you were never taught social skills suddenly if you go out and you try to socialize and you literally don't know what to say it's not because you're stupid it's because like hey oh you don't know how to play the game of socialization maybe that's because you never had the tutorial it's like like some of us are playing life as if we're playing the elden ring enemy randomizer and we've never played a video game in our life like no there's no tutorial we're just dropped in because remember that life is more like the enemy randomizer like it's not crafted for us to do level one and then level two and level three love it's not crafted for us to succeed like a video game it's just rng and sometimes like the first person that you date is a level 100 narcissist it's not like life gives you the level one narcissist first so that you learn how to deal with them and then level two and then the level three and then the level four and the level five and then eventually you can deal with the level 100 narcissists that's not how it works it's like rng so you've got to like cut yourself some slack acknowledge that if you struggle is there more you can do a hundred percent but were you taught how to socialize as you had social difficulties or when you dropped out of high school did your parents ever come and talk to you about it and be like hey now that you've dropped out of high school we should probably do something to make sure you get your social activity and you can continue to make friends right so i see this with parents who homeschool where they'll like intentionally and actively enroll their kids in extracurricular activities because they acknowledge if they homeschool they're not going to get any social development so we've got to make sure we do that as you start to change the way that you think about yourself in the way that you talk to yourself mistakes will be less devastating and the future will be more bright you'll be able to do more things the last thing is that i do think that therapy and medication can have a good role here that's where we also don't know how long this person is on medication but just a reminder a couple things about medication the first is that antidepressants tend to take about eight weeks to become effective so if you started the medication a week ago it's not going to do anything yet that's the amount of time that it takes to become effective eight weeks so for two months not going to see a whole lot potentially some people it happens earlier some people you'll get benefits within two weeks or one month but give it at least eight weeks second thing to consider is that if you are in a depressive episode if you actually have a clinical diagnosis of major depressive disorder bipolar disorder some kind of other mood disorder that these things are generally speaking temporary so we know that depressive episodes generally speaking last from anywhere from a few weeks to a month to about one year and so as long as you stay on medication hopefully it'll reduce the frequency and severity of those episodes next thing is if your therapist says here's a medication go find a job gg go and they're not supporting you in that process you should probably find a different therapist and that's where most therapists don't prescribe medication so i don't know exactly what you mean by therapists so that's where like give yourself a little bit of slack give yourself time for the medication to work by the way all this stuff is in dr k's guide to depression where we explain some of these core concepts and how psychotherapy works and how medication works and some of these things like that so the other thing you should absolutely do is educate yourself but at the end of the day if every dimension of your life seems to be falling apart the most important thing is not to fix this thing over here this thing over here this thing over here and this thing over here it's actually to fix the common element which is here it's to fix the tool with which you play the game of life and fixing the tool starts with a very very subtle thing of distributing responsibility because chances are if you're going nowhere in life at the age of 24 you weren't taught how to go somewhere and this kind of cognitive reframing and this is also why we started career coaching by the way because we realize that there's all kinds of skills there's a connection between emotions behavior self-understanding and self-judgment and even like a certain how-to so if you look at our coaching program our coaching program is actually designed to address these kinds of issues so even in career coaching it's like how do you put together a resume how do you talk to your boss in general coaching it's going to be like more about okay let's understand the thought patterns of your mind let's understand how the thought patterns of your mind where they come from and how they interfere with what you do let's also give you a space where if you need to vent off negative emotional energy you can do it in a healthy manner in a coaching sort of environment so that when you go for your job interview like you're not carrying those negative emotions around right so you could definitely do that in therapy as well but therapy is going to be more clinically focused and generally speaking your therapist will say things like it's important for you to find a job whereas they're not most of us are not formally trained in like helping people find jobs we're formally trained in diagnosis and treatment right so that's why we have a career coaching program because we hear this kind of crap entirely too much i went to therapy they told me to find a job but they didn't tell me how so that's where like at the end of the day you've got to challenge your mindset you have to shape your mindset because that's the instrument that you use for everything your mind is going to be the thing that determines your social interactions whether you apply for a job whether you get a ged all of that requires your mind so the mind is the first thing to fix questions so pixi kate is saying so many therapists are not qualified i swear i'd like to be a little bit more optimistic than that i think a lot of therapists are operating in a system that does not allow them to succeed i think a lot a lot of the way that therapy is delivered is i think not the fault of the therapist we have a medical system that overemphasizes particular problems which is entirely why coaching has cropped up why did the therapists were great at this stuff there would there would have been no market for this bluntly but over time what's happening is therapy is becoming more protocolized it's becoming more generic and it's becoming more medical legal you have 45 minute appointments sorry i have to see like six numbers six people to like make my rvus and meet my productivity quota so i don't have an extra half hour for you i'm sorry that the the insurance provider does not pay for a 75-minute appointment the most they'll pay for is a 50-minute appointment and that's because there are all these studies that show that 50 minute appointments are effective medical treatments for depression so that's not additional time i can give you there's a lot of how therapists also though some of them will assess for suicidality on every visit with every patient right so i i'd like to cut my colleagues a little bit more slack and and sort of like i acknowledge that you know if they operate a particular way is it that they're under qualified or undertrained i don't think so i think they're squeezed just like everyone else's you
