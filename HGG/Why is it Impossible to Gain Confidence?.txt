today I want to talk to you all a little bit about why you can't gain confidence so a lot of people out there will struggle to gain confidence and there'll even be people out there who will sort of give them lots of solutions right so you'll have people like dating coaches who'll be like yeah if you want to you want to gain confidence you got to get out there right you got to ask out a bunch of women or men or whatever and the more that you do it the more confidence you'll gain I want to take a moment to thank our HD coaches I've taught it a lot of different places and worked with a lot of different people and honestly our coaches are some of the best people I've ever worked with he coaches have helped over 10 000 people find purpose Direction and improve their mental health after about 20 weeks of coaching the average client experiences a 58 Improvement in sense of purpose in life a 45 Improvement in feelings of anxiety and even a 35 reduction in feelings of Despair and this isn't just me saying this at this point we've done this for three years run six research studies and even presented our findings at the American Psychiatric association National Conference over one hundred thousand sessions later I can confidently say this works so if you're interested in checking out he coaching for yourself go to healthygamer.gg coaching to learn more but sometimes that's not actually our experience right like we go out there we ask out a bunch of women we get rejected a lot and somehow like with each rejection our confidence doesn't build it kind of starts to Crater more and more and more and so then we're kind of left with this sort of idea like okay what am I supposed to do to gain confidence because a lot of people out there are saying oh yeah just get out there and you'll get more confident you gotta practice right and there'll be a lot of people out there who will say yeah it worked for me this is how I gain confidence and you just gotta keep at it bro you got to keep at it like practice makes perfect but sometimes it doesn't seem to work and I completely understand why it doesn't seem to work because bizarrely you can't actually gain confidence I would almost go as far as saying it's impossible to gain confidence and that may sound really bizarre but hear me out so the reason you can't gain confidence is because confidence is actually the default state what you gain over time is insecurity so the problem with gaining confidence is that we're all trying to get something when actually what we need to do is let something go the solution to quote unquote getting back to confidence or being confident isn't to gain confidence it's to unlearn insecurity so let me explain what I mean so if you think about it like think about a child a child's default state is actually confidence right like if you look at like a two-year-old like two-year-olds don't have insecurity problems chances are right and we'll get to the situation in which they do two-year-olds are like they're Babel like a one-year-old is like babbling like they don't care what people think like they're just they can't even talk they can't walk they can't feed themselves they can't even use the bathroom they don't know how to wipe their ass and like oh my God these little pathetic little human beings they can't do anything they're not Alphas for sure right actually maybe they're a little bit Chad you know depends on the one-year-old but the truth of the matter is like kids can't do anything like a toddler like they can do anything and yet they're supremely confident right another good example of this is you can look at animals so what is like an animal's Natural State like if you've got a dog and like if a dog is like pretty normal and has a normal life like what's gonna happen they're gonna be confident they're happy they like human beings they're going to walk up to you they're going to you know wag their tail they want to be petted they want to play with you and so if you really look at the default nature of things it is actually including human beings is to be confident and so then the question becomes okay well then why do people lose confidence it's not about gaining it's that they lose it well that's because they're taught in security so now let's go back to the one-year-old or the five-year-old or maybe you nine-year-old 10 year old 15 year old think about high school right you used to be confident and then what happened as you hit puberty you had particular experiences that caused you to lose confidence you were 12 and you were like on top of the world and then one day you walked in to school except your water bottle was leaking in your backpack and since your water bottle was leaking in your backpack there was a wet stain on your bum and then everyone laughed at you and then suddenly you became insecure they started making fun of you and then your confidence went down into the pits and now you have gained insecurity so the reason that people can't go out and gain confidence is because confidence isn't gained it's actually lost this is really important to understand and there's a ton of research to support this if you look at people who have low self-esteem the correlation with Ace or adverse childhood experiences is very very very high if you look at people who have major depressive disorder there's now a kind of Forefront hypothesis that major depressive disorder is not caused by serotonin imbalance but is actually caused by adverse childhood experiences we sort of know that trauma leads to a lack of self-confidence and so we really kind of think about it now we can start to see why gaining confidence is so hard because it's not about acquiring something that we don't have it's actually about offloading something that we picked up and so the reason it's hard to find confidence or gain confidence we go out looking into the world we go to this place we go to that place I'm going to go to this seminar I'm going to go to this Workshop I'm going to do this kind of success gurus thing I'm going to work with a dating coach I'm going to read this book about finding confidence we're going to do all these things to gain confidence and we'll get to why some of those things can work towards the end but we can kind of see why it doesn't work because it's not something that's gained it's something that you actually you have to unlearn insecurity so then the question kind of becomes okay so how do I unlearn insecurity all we're really asking you to do is return to your Baseline you don't have to do anything special you just have to get rid of the crap that you accumulated Acro along the way so this is where I think there's a very useful Concept in Sanskrit called the samskar so a samskar is like an undigested ball of emotion or what I would kind of call like a nugget of trauma so if we look through our life what we tend to find is that we were confident and there are these singular experiences that are almost these tiny nuggets of trauma that will kind of sink into our mind and change the way that we view ourselves in cognitive behavioral therapy these are this is related to something called the concept of a core belief right because when you go to high school and everyone makes fun of you and then they call you wet butt or whatever right you get some kind of nickname that then forms a belief and each time someone makes fun of you and calls you wet butt then what happens is that there's another nugget of trauma that gets inserted into your mind and another one in another one in another one and so over time what happens is these trauma these little teen nuggies grow in your mind and they start to become something that you believe about yourself right because you get all of this external input and then you internalize those feelings you can also see that in cases of like abusive relationships where you have a child even as young as one-year-old who grows up in a household where their parents were never satisfied with them right so like I grew up in an Asian household so this was really common where like my value as a human being was always comparative so it was like you know it didn't matter that I got an A What mattered is even if I got a 91 and that was an a if some other kid got a 99 like why couldn't I get a 99 so this is where over time we actually start getting imbued with insecurity and so if we want to go back to confidence I don't think achieve confidence is the right idea what we actually have to do is a process of unlearning and so this is what Psychotherapy is about right so one way to do this is you can go see a psychotherapist and especially if you have trauma that rises to the level of like a diagnosis and if you're not sure does it rise to the level of a diagnosis like that's what a professional can help you figure out right you can go see a professional they can diagnose you with a trauma-based disorder or not but this is what we do in psychotherapy but the cool thing is that the majority of this work actually does not get done in Psychotherapy most human beings over the course of their life will gain some amount of confidence and like start to believe different things about themselves right like we become secure in our own skin and so what we're going to do is walk you all through a little bit about what that process looks like so I'd start with the question when was the last time you were confident okay because most of us I'd say 90 to 95 of people I've worked with have been confident at some point in the last five to ten percent sometimes they they were actually in traumatic experiences before they can remember so we're talking about six months old one-year-old two-year-old but that's really the exception rather than the rule so think about the last time you were confident and think about what happened that changed right so if you kind of say oh yeah I was confident when I was nine but by the time I was like 13 I wasn't confident anymore and then what you'll do is if you ask yourself what happened in the middle chances are you've got a very powerful emotional experience somewhere in there and you will remember it really well and if y'all watch our interviews you'll see that people will recall like specific things that happened to them when they were 10 when they were 11 when they were 13. and these are the formation of a samskar this is the formation this is the Nugget of trauma that gets inserted now what happens when when we kind of enter into the state is that there's a pile of emotions so the first thing is that these are usually very emotionally charged experiences and then the second thing that happens is we don't really process those emotions right so if you really think about getting called wet butt because your butt was wet the real way to process that is hey accidents happen sometimes water bottles are defective it doesn't mean anything about me right like I'm actually not incontinent I'm not like pathetic and you know like I don't pee in my pants this is literally the reality of it was that a water bottle leaked and hey that happens sometimes but if you really think about that child in that moment that's not the belief that you come away with that emotion is so powerful that it leads you to believe that you are pathetic even though the kids were wrong right like the kids weren't even right like you didn't even do anything wrong and I would say that in 90 of people that I've worked with the beliefs that they have about themselves are not actually realistic and what do I mean by realistic I mean that they're not based in reality so even if you look at someone who lacks confidence and is a hundred percent sure that they are worth nothing that's because they had a narcissistic parent who was emotionally immature and would displace all of their anger and frustration onto the child the child actually didn't do anything wrong right that's the whole point behind traumatic relationships is that people don't deserve the way that they were treated and so this is the real tricky thing is that we end up accumulating these beliefs about ourselves that are from highly charged emotional situations that we carry forward with us and we start to make conclusions we get conditioned to believe particular things because that nugget of trauma sinks deep into our mind and then causes us to form an idea about who we are and we carry that forward and then what happens is we go out we go see a dating coach or we go to this thing or we go do that thing to try to gain confidence but the problem is that as long as this belief about myself deep down is in there I can go see as many dating coaches as I want to but like talking to a thousand women won't kind of Matt I mean it can matter but as long as I don't deal with that nugget of trauma that's deep inside my mind that some scar you know the rest of that stuff is like kind of barking at the up the wrong tree so what we really need to do is go back and re-examine those experiences right and re-contextualize them think a little bit about how how I felt in that moment and this is the other really tricky thing about these experiences is that the more powerful the emotion is the more it sinks in but the really tricky thing is that the more powerful the emotion is the more incorrect our conclusion about ourselves will be because we didn't form a judgment about ourselves based on careful thought and consideration from a calm mind right we're very very emotional so that deeper it sinks the longer it is and this is the problem with the samskar and this is why you can go look for confidence outside in the world as much as you want to but until you as long as you're carrying that nugget of trauma around it's going to be really hard to find confidence and so what do we do with this nugget of trauma so we go into a lot more detail in for example Dr K's guide or our coaching program this is what our coaches are kind of really good at is that they're they're good at sort of helping people dig back and understand where they form their beliefs about themselves and then like use that understanding to actually engage in positive behaviors moving forward they really focus on that latter part and if you've really been kind of traumatized I'd highly recommend you see a therapist but if you're really focused on I have some belief about myself or I have something internal that holds me back from moving forward then coaching may be a better fit but even today we're going to talk you all through the basic theory that we share with our coaches and that we sort of use in this community in this in Dr K's guide so you kind of think about that experience then you kind of analyze it right so what did you feel in that moment what were the beliefs that you formed about yourself and now this is the key thing looking back on it now what were some more appropriate conclusions that you could have drawn and as you kind of do that you'll start to realize oh my God actually it wasn't my fault that people called me pathetic I actually didn't even do anything wrong and then a couple of things will happen the first is that you're gonna feel like really really sad and feel a ton of grief and you got to be ready for that because what that means is that for the last 10 years of your life you've been carrying around a belief about yourself that isn't even true and you've suffered so much even though you didn't deserve it and that in and of itself can hurt a lot and when we start working with some scars or these nuggets of trauma we can have those kinds of experiences so let that grief come and if you want to if you can let yourself cry because here's the beautiful thing when you cry that's our physiologic way of processing that emotion and the more that we cry actually this is beautiful the less powerful that belief becomes and the more we will actually get closer to confidence you don't necessarily need to cry but if whatever emotions come up as you kind of re-examine that stuff just let them come up right and sit with it and then we're going to move on to the next part which is really really important which is what we want to do next is now as you start to move forward in life it as you try to engage in particular behaviors what's going to happen is that nugget of trauma is going to surface the samscar will surface and as you go to a party there will be a little voice in your head that says hey you're not worth being friends with hey people don't like you this is a lesson that you learned and that's what a lack of confidence looks like right it manifests in the moment and tells you something about yourself it says hey these other people can do this but you can't because they are this way and you were this way and so what you'll see is these lessons that you learned early in life will manifest in your mind and will prevent you from actually acting and then you can struggle with that lack of confidence sometimes you can overcome it sometimes you can't right that's the experience of it so the next thing that we need to do is when that lack of confidence surfaces we need to pause don't fight it don't overcome it don't conquer it just sit with it and say hey okay hold on a second here's that lack of confidence here's that feeling and this is what if you pay attention this is what it's going to be the feeling that you feel in that moment is going to be an echo of what you felt that day that you walked in to school it'll be an image an echo a mirror it'll be like a little piece of that it's that emotional energy that is unprocessed and stored in your mind and as it's unprocessed and stored in your mind it'll come up again and now what you need to do is realize hey hold on a second what My Mind Is Telling Me In This Moment isn't actually true this is just the echo from the trauma of the past this is the conclusion that I learned from this inappropriate kind of scenario right so it's an inappropriate conclusion and as you notice it in the moment it takes practice but hopefully what will start to happen is it's power over you a lesson as you notice oh hold on a second it's not that I'm actually not worth being friends with this is just the echo from the past that made me believe that I'm not worth being friends with then you kind of acknowledge it in the moment you can you can kind of ask yourself hey In This Moment Like can I set this belief about myself aside can I actually try to enjoy the time that I'm about to spend with these people and even that noticing in the moment also leads to digestion of that emotion and so if you do these two things if you kind of like process the emotion kind of sitting by yourself in your room whatever or if you catch it in the act and acknowledge it for what it is if you see it it'll start to diminish and the Beautiful Thing is as you do this over and over and over again that nugget of trauma will start to get digested and as the Nugget of trauma starts to get digested you will naturally feel confident you didn't actually have to go out and gain it what all you have to do is just be yourself you're going to feel free you're going to feel normal you're going to feel natural and that's when confidence comes back now one last thing that I kind of want to touch on is but what about all these people who will say go out and build confidence so usually what happens in those situations is as you go out into those scenarios that emotion will come up once again and in the process of engaging with that emotion in the present you can actually get some amount of digestion there as well the reason that I prefer this methodology and the reason that for example in our coaching program we don't actually Advocate that you know people go out there and like re-traumatize themselves over and over and over again because that's the problem with just going out there right is that if you're lucky you'll those feelings will come up you'll recognize them you'll grow through it you can absolutely do that right you can realize oh that these people aren't rejecting me for me they're rejecting me because they have their own problems some people go down that route the problem with just going out there is that sometimes it actually enhances the trauma even more and I've seen this for example with like bad parenting where like oh like someone has a phobia of dogs so I'm going to take my kid and I'm going to dump him in a pen with a dog and they'll overcome the fear right and sometimes that works in terms of overcoming the fear and sometimes it traumatizes people that's why we much prefer this method because the real battle is like internal right you don't actually have to re-traumatize yourself in order to overcome the trauma you can actually confront those inner demons and you want to expose yourself a little bit right so you want to go into those situations where the samskar is evoked and then you can kind of like notice it but you don't need to like hardcore re-traumatize yourself to overcome your trauma because for some people that works really well if they're resilient enough and for other people it just cripples them worse so I know it sounds kind of bizarre but the truth of the matter is that the reason that it's hard to gain confidence and the reason that going out there and gaining confidence works for some people and is traumatic for others is because you can't really gain it all you can do is lose it and if you want to go back to being confident it's not about going out there and finding it it's about actually unlearning the insecurity and that is done through sort of digesting a some SCAR or sort of processing this nugget of trauma
