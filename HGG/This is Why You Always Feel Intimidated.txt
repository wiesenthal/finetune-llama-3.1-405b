today we're going to talk about how to overcome feeling intimidated [Music] and this is a big problem it's not something that people talk about a lot right because it's not like depression or bipolar disorder or suicidality but unfortunately it's like a really common experience for a lot of people you're kind of going throughout your day and then you run across someone who just feels really intimidating this is someone that is kind of like maybe if they're at work or if they're at school or maybe in even in a social setting where you meet someone who's just like better than you in some way and the way that they're talking or the way that they're acting or maybe they're giving a presentation they sort of evoke all of these feelings of like kind of inferiority and then what happens is you kind of feel like you don't belong there you look around and you start to see other people who are like better than you at stuff hey y'all I want to take a moment to talk about the sponsor of today's video Babble Babble is one of the top language learning apps in the world what I really love about Babel is that instead of just wasting time on my phone I'm actually learning another language it uses sounds it uses different sorts of images and things like that and it almost gamifies the language learning process I also really love that Babel is built by actual teachers so these are people that know what it's like to teach people and know what works and doesn't work the other really cool thing is that their methodology is scientifically validated so they've done studies that show that you can gain a significant amount of proficiency in as little as three weeks and I've absolutely seen that so I love Mexican food I live down here in Texas and I speak some Spanish but after using Babel for just a couple of weeks I found that I can actually order in Spanish far more proficiently so I'm learning phrases like Metro LA cuenta which means can I have the check please which is like really fantastic so it's really easy to learn so if y'all are interested check out the link in the description for 60 off of your subscription and thank you to Babel for sponsoring today's video and what does it cause you to do it causes you to kind of like retreat right and then you have these kinds of thoughts like oh my God like I don't belong here or these people are so much smarter than me better than me more capable than me like I I don't know how I ended up there sometimes like you even feel some degree of imposter syndrome I remember this happened to me when I was interviewing for medical school and you're like sitting in the waiting room waiting for your interview with all these other medical school applicants and you make small talk right and they're telling you like oh yeah like hi my name is so and so like what's your name oh okay like what are you interested in I say I'm interested in this and they say I'm interested in this and I did research in these labs and then I worked for the United Nations and I I like did free surgeries for people in Africa and they start talking to you about like how amazing they are and then I start to feel like terrible it's like I didn't do any of that stuff and then I start to feel insecure and then I can't really Retreat from it so sometimes I'm in my own head so now when I go into the interview I'm not even thinking about myself and how awesome I am all I'm thinking about is how this other person is better than me but in other situations like social situations right you meet someone and they feel intimidating and what do you do you kind of like retreat and so the real tragedy about feeling intimidated is we have all of these thoughts and then we tend to retreat from those situations and every time we Retreat life gets narrower right because now now I'm not able to go to that party now I feel like I I don't belong at that place I can't go hang out with these people because there's this person there who's better than me at something else and so what happens is our life becomes narrower and narrower and narrower in the worst cases we start spending more and more time in front of screens we're spending more time at home and we're spending we feel safe with people who don't really Inspire us right so what I sort of noticed in my own life is I started hanging out with people who never intimidated me and the real challenge is that a lot of the people that didn't intimidate me were not the people I needed to be spending my time with and so the real tragedy of sort of letting intimidation control you is that it cuts you off from opportunities that you should be engaging in because those are the people that you actually want as your peers right those are the people that you want to sort of be spending time with that inspire you towards positive action but the problem is that they don't inspire you they just intimidate you and as an aside we're not talking about people who are trying to intimidate you that's a whole different thing right we're not talking about someone who's like walking up and getting in your face and trying to like tell you to get the hell out of there and trying to make you feel unwelcome what I'm talking about is I think the far more common experience of feeling intimidated with a group of people so let's start by understanding a little bit about what does that actually look like so sometimes people don't even realize that they're feeling intimidated and what what that manifests as in the mind is you'll have all of these thoughts like you'll notice that okay this person is so amazing I'm not as good as they are I'm not as smart as they are I'm not as articulate as they are I'm not as charismatic I'm not as good looking so you'll kind of look at someone else and within yourself you will notice thoughts of deficiencies the other way to sort of recognize intimidation is you will start to think about what the other person thinks so you'll think what will this person think when they see me this person is so put together and so articulate and so professional what are they going to see when they look at me they're going to see someone who's a slob there's gonna they're gonna see someone who's unprofessional and so you spend a lot of time thinking about how other people will perceive you in a negative light but at its root this is a feeling of intimidation right because they're up there and you're down here so if you have those kinds of thoughts around people hopefully we'll be able to help you with that the second thing to understand is what is intimidation so intimidation is something that is actually has a very specific set of requirements to trigger in your mind we actually don't get intimidated by everyone there's a lot of people out there who are capable of doing things that we're not capable of or not very good at right there are people out there who are good at cooking or good at playing video games but it's not like every person you encounter who is better than eat you at something intimidates you there are particular things that we're sensitive to that make us feel intimidated and this is what's really wild is what makes us feel intimidated is actually identification with the person when we see ourselves in another human being but that person does a better job of being us than we do that's when we feel intimidated when we look at someone else and we say I could do this if I were different if I was smarter I would be like this person if I was more disciplined I would be like this person it's they're just a version of me that's like better than me right they're more articulate they're a little bit better looking or this person made the right choices when I made the wrong choices so if I had stayed in school or if I had chosen to become you know not switch into pre-med and and stayed in computer science or whatever if I decided not to go to college and play pro League of Legends or valorent or whatever so what we see what actually triggers the the sense of intimations is really important to understand is not that this person is different from you it's that that for the most part they're similar except for one thing and that is the quality which you feel is intimidating right so really think about that for a second that what gets evoked as intimidation is actually the way that you relate to the person and that you can see yourself in that person except you were lacking in a couple of different ways so intimidation is not about that person being different it's actually about that person being the same and so the real problem with this is when we see ourselves in someone else and we think to ourselves wow I could be that if I dot dot dot our natural reaction is to beat ourselves up right because then you start to like look at your life and you start to regret you're like oh I should have done this differently or if I had woken up every day or if I had studied harder or if I had you know spent some time like working on my appearance or going to the gym then I could look like that person so as we beat ourselves up and we point out our shortcomings what does that do psychologically that makes us feel more insecure it reinforces the insecurity and the more that we reinforce the insecurity the more ammo there is for us to be intimidated because what is it that's actually fueling that feeling of of intimidation it's actually our own insecurities and this is why intimidation is so hard to overcome right and there may be some people out there that give you answers like oh you just gotta you just got to do it you gotta like put yourself out there right and as you listen to these people who say just put yourself out there you're like bro or girl I don't think you understand what it's like when I put myself out there you can put yourself out there because you're different from me that doesn't work for me and why is that it's because when you put yourself out there you feel really bad you start to regret even more you start to beat yourself up and then it feeds the insecurity and now you put yourself out there once and now you're more insecure so what happens the next time you put yourself out there it's easier to feel intimidated and then you beat yourself up again and then you're like wow all these other people can put themselves out there but I can't even put myself out there that feeds the insecurity even more and then you try again because everyone's telling you just put yourself out there bro you try a third time and each time you go through the cycle it gets worse and now like now it makes sense why you can't put yourself out there and why you think it's a bad idea and why it doesn't work for you because it literally doesn't work for you so let's understand a couple of things first thing to really acknowledge if you can but this may actually come at the end is that if you're there you deserve to be there if you get invited to a party and you feel intimidated by other people you still got invited to the party so unless you're like literally trespassing right or like somewhere where you really don't belong I'm not saying like what your mind thinks you don't belong unless you're trespassing or breaking a law you actually belong there and that's something that I experienced a ton when I started residency at Harvard Medical Schools like I felt really intimidated I was like look at all these amazing people out there turns out I'm pretty amazing too and so are you and the second thing that we're going to tell you to do maybe a little bit scary but it's really really effective okay so if we think a little bit about intimidation we recognize equality in that person that we think is good right otherwise you wouldn't be intimidated by it they're so articulate the other problem with intimidation is that we're in our own heads and you may notice that the more you are in your own head the worse the situation becomes oh my God what is this person going to think what should I say I don't belong here I should go home I should run away oh my God oh my God oh my God you're all up in here so you're not able to enjoy the experience audience at all you're not actually able to participate so what we need to do is externalize your attention and the way that we're going to do that is going to be absolutely terrifying but it works really well okay so we actually want to do is Express appreciation for the thing that we think is pretty cool so recognize that when you feel intimidation the flip side of that coin is actually appreciation because you're seeing something in someone else that is like a positive quality that's why you feel intimidated because you don't have it so one thing that you can actually do which is really wild is walk up to that person and say hey I really appreciate dot dot dot so if someone gives a good presentation in class and you feel like that person's presentation is way better than yours after class walk up to him and say hey I really I thought your presentation was fantastic I particularly like the way that you did A B and C now this may sound absolutely terrifying and we're going to help you out with that but let's understand why it works so I recently saw a really interesting study that if you look at people who are depressed people have mood disorders and active depressive episodes the idea is that normally like they need help right so what we should really do is try to help them a lot because they're depressed and they need help but there's a study that actually found that when people who are depressed help other people it actually improves their symptoms so sometimes what we need to do is take that feeling of intimidation and recognize that you can't be intimidated unless you appreciate or respect something about someone that's the only way that it can happen unless they're trying to intimidate you obviously and so then what we actually want to do is instead of giving in to the negative manifestation of this emotion what we actually want to do is kind of flip it around and express some appreciation and you all may have heard about things like expressing gratitude and like changing your mindset and all this kind of crap this is literally how you do it you walk up to that person and say hey I really appreciate the way that you presented that that was a really cool presentation and now suddenly what you've done is you've externalized it a little bit we're going to help you all if you're all over thinking oh my God but then what I can't say that we're going to help you don't worry wait wait with me bear with me okay so first thing we've done is externalize we've also engaged with that person so instead of retreating from it which causes narrowing of your life and closing of doors and opportunities we're actually like not being intimidated by it right you may feel intimidation but you can go and you can express appreciation because that's authentic that's what's really cool it's not actually being fake it's actually channeling something that you feel towards this person okay but then then what and that's where you can sort of follow it up with an open-ended question so you can walk up to someone you can say hey I really appreciate insert quality that I am intimidated by can you tell me a little bit about why you chose that as a topic or you know let's say you're intimidated by someone's appearance I know this sounds kind of weird but this is something that I've done that works really well you can walk up to someone at a party and say hey you're really rocking that jacket like that looks lit right and just think about that how would someone feel if you walked up to them and you said that now if you sort of play it too far I'm saying say one thing don't keep on oh and your hair is beautiful and I love your skin and I love your shoes and I love everything about you you're just so magn don't do that that's terrifying okay so just say the one thing don't be like verbal diary on them of appreciation so just say one thing hey I really appreciate this thing and then follow it up with some kind of question like that's a rocking jacket how did you decide to wear that today right or if someone's giving a presentation you can say hey I really love the way that you sort of put together that table or that Meme at the end was brilliant you know can you tell me a little bit about why you chose this topic so ask an open-ended question it shouldn't be a yes or no question that's really important and then just ask that and then it doesn't have to be a long interaction so here's the other thing because what people are oftentimes terrified is like what do they say then right and that's where it's like sometimes if you even go up to someone and compliment them who's embarrassed now right because when you walk up to someone you say hey this is a really fantastic presentation I love that Meme at the end you just say it with a smile and then they're like oh my God right and suddenly they're feeling embarrassed and you've made them feel good right which is pretty cool and so if you're worried about how to extract yourself from the conversation you can even just say hey so like they say oh this is how I chose to to you know put together this presentation so you ask your question and then they're going to come back to you and maybe that it'll turn into a conversation but you're terrified how do I make it into a conversation you can't make it into a conversation you don't need to make it into a conversation you went there to say your piece if they engage with you engage back right so we're gonna hit the tennis ball across the court we're gonna wait for it to come back if it doesn't come back you can say well I just wanted to share with that with you awesome presentation right and then you can just walk away just extract yourself from the con it's okay you just walk up and say hey I thought you did a fantastic job pleasure to meet you my name is so and so I was curious about this thank you so much and then you just walk out and so what does this do this is really important because it does a couple of really key things the first is it allows us to not Retreat right this is what's really important and then we'll develop some degree of Tolerance we're not giving in to the intimidation the second is that it takes that authentic gap between you and the other person and sort of like that thing that you appreciate about them and you're actually like vocalizing it and you're owning it and like that's okay you're actually engaging with this person you're also externalizing your attention and if you need a little bit of help extracting yourself from the conversation that's totally fine some of y'all may be thinking to yourselves I could never do that you'd be surprised have a little bit of faith in yourself I've got faith in you but the other thing that you can do if you're terrified of actually engaging with that person or if the sense of intimidation is too strong okay I'm not going to tell you to just do it I acknowledge that there's an internal process that you can also do in the safety of your own home okay with no one watching which is I want you to think about okay what do I see in this person because what you see in that person honestly if you really pay attention you see a version of yourself and really tunnel down into that and ask yourself what is really different between this person and me and while your mind May generate a thousand different answers I want you to kind of pick the one that feels the most important to you even if your mind comes up with five answers you can write them all down and you can like say okay which one is the biggest one because one of them is going to be driving it and then notice that quality and then just ask yourself right because you see the possibility of yourself in that person that's why you feel intimidated and so pick that one thing and then ask yourself a second question which is what is one thing that I can do to move towards that goal how can I move one step closer to being what this person has and this is what's really important is oftentimes when we get intimidated by someone we want to be them so we don't think about one thing we think about the thousand different things that I need to do before I become what that person is and that's why you got to be a little bit careful don't worry about the thousand things your mind may tell you oh there's no way you can ever get there because there's so many things that are different instead pick one thing and ask yourself okay so this person was articulate what can I do to be more articulate maybe I should practice my presentations for 15 minutes before I give them okay so you really try to Tunnel it down into one thing and Implement that one thing the really cool thing is when you do that not only do you become more articulate because you're practicing and you're intentional but the other really cool thing is instead of just being like weighed down by this intimidation or treating from it you're actually improving in some small way and as you start to improve in some small way we're going to start to see the reverse cycle where now instead of like feeding your insecurity and feeling more intimidated you'll start to develop a tiny bit of confidence as you start to develop a tiny bit of confidence as you re-engage with people you'll be more comfortable being there as you're more comfortable being there you start to enjoy it a little bit more because you're comfortable and that's why we don't like it because we're uncomfortable and then as you're able to be there a little bit more you'll see the reverse of the Vicious Cycle where now you're more comfortable and you're hanging out with them you start to form relationships now the next time you think about going it isn't as scary to go the second time and the third time and each time you kind of do this process you will get a little bit better so it's really unfortunate that oftentimes we feel really intimidated by people who aren't even trying we're walking around going about our business and we enter into situations where we see people who are smarter than us more articulate than us more attractive than us more physically in shape than us more knowledgeable than us we walk around the world and our mind sees all kinds of things and when we feel that intimidation it manifestes all these thoughts like oh my God like this person is so much better than me or whatever or you start to think about what they will see when they look at me oh my God what is this person gonna think I am so pathetic I'm so not put together they're so put together and if you notice there's a comparison and the reason that you feel intimidated is actually because you see a version of yourself in that person this person has accomplished what you could have done if you had made different choices or wear slightly different human being if you are more disciplined and lived up to your potential then you could be that person and so when you see that person you see your own regret and that's what your mind actually tries to retreat from because if you think about why does the Mind Retreat when we feel intimidated it's to try to protect us from feeling that regret that we see when when we encounter that other person and if we move away from the other person then there's no regret the challenge is that as we move away from that person we start to narrow the scope of our life doors start to close because now I can't go to that entrepreneurship conference now I can't go to this extracurricular activity I can't go to this party I can't apply for this job interview and so our life becomes smaller and smaller and smaller and then it becomes more and more insecure right because we have fewer things to be proud of in the whole cycle repeats itself so instead recognize that actually the reason that you feel intimidated is because you are capable of what the other person is you just need to make some changes and in the short term one thing that you can really do to avoid that Retreat and avoid getting trapped in your own head is just Express appreciation towards that person even if it's a little bit uncomfortable for you certainly makes their day right so like that's pretty cool and acknowledge that hey I really appreciate this thing that's why I feel intimidated you don't have to share that right so you just walk up and say hey I really appreciate this followed up with a question and if they choose not to engage with you because maybe they're embarrassed by the positive feedback and they don't know what to say then you can say hey I just wanted to share that thank you so much it was a great presentation it was nice to meet you and then you walk away and even if that is scary you can go through this introspective process of recognizing okay what do I see in this other person and how can I take one step towards that don't try to become the other person but what can I do just one step forward that'll help me move towards this goal because I know I'm capable if you didn't know you were capable you wouldn't be intimidated by it in the first place foreign
