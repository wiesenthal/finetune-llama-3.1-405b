when I watch 10 clips of people hitting it big what do you think my brain learns about the likelihood that I will win it big if I see saw a clip of a hundred people losing a ton of money what would I learn if I saw a clip of 100 people winning a bunch of money what would I learn why do people warning me about the risks make me want to do it more what a great question how can someone with ADHD have a healthy relationship with a game like poker oh my God such good questions so when someone warns you again away from something sometimes you want to do it more ain't that the truth the question is why is that so a couple things to consider the first is that if you're so that we know that like oppositional Natures are somewhat of a personality characteristic so I think some kids learn best by being told and some kids learn best by sort of figuring it out themselves I've spent a lot of time with kids from both camps so some of that is just personality where we have a society where the more we standardize protocolize you know Institute warning things were not really accommodating a particular type A personality type variant within our population which is that some kids like need to be like they're they they're sort of Discovery Learners as opposed to dissemination some kids like are fine with disseminating information they just kind of absorb it like a sponge and they're good but if you're a discovery learner then what you need to do is like explore the concept yourself and we just don't facilitate self-understandings that's the first issue number two is that sometimes the reason that we're rebellious when we're told not to do something is because we discovered early on that the things that are forbidden for us are actually really fantastic like sometimes that's what it is so imagine that I grew up in a household where you know I wasn't so I wasn't like allowed to drink let's say Coke right all the other kids get to have Coke and all the other kids get to play video games I don't get to play video games I don't get to have Coke so I don't get to have Sprite on get to have any soda Pepsi nothing and so like when I go to my friend's house and I have a soda and I get to play video games I'm like wow this is really amazing I love this stuff so some of us then learn what's the lesson that that child learns the child learns that oh the stuff that is restricted to me is like actually fantastic and so once you learn that if you've been raised in a very restrictive household then you're going to have some programming or conditioning to run into the direction of what you've been warned away against right so I think those are two really really really key things to think about if you want to understand why do I gravitate towards things that are forbidden you have to explore your own experience with things that are forbidden and try to figure out like where did this attraction to the Forbidden thing come from and recognize that a certain amount of it may be personality second question was how can someone with ADHD have a healthy relationship with a game like poker the answer is honestly it's hard so what we know from research on ADHD is that people with ADHD are first of all more vulnerable to addictions in general compared to the population there's a whole video about that in Dr K's guide to ADHD and doing stuff basically if you look at how the brains of people with ADHD are different what you find is there's some Neuroscience change some change changes in capacity like higher amount of impulsivity less amount of delayed gratification difficulty executing and planning tasks a tendency to procrastinate these are vulnerabilities of the ADHD brain and what you find is Along Comes an addiction and they're like hey I see that you're highly impulsive and have trouble delaying gratification you're now my new best friend let's go let's go party let's have a great great time and so it's almost like ADHD is like gives you a debuff that makes you vulnerable to addiction so if you've got ADHD and you're playing video games or gambling or stuff like that just recognize that it's going to be an uphill battle for you compared to a neurotypical person and I think there's like strong enough evidence for me to be able to make that generalization not saying that people with ADHD can't conquer addictions or not everyone is prone to addiction but if we look at populations of people if we take a thousand people with ADHD and a thousand people who are neurotypical what we'll find is that the amount of addiction in the ADHD population will be higher than the neurotypical pumps just how it is the other thing is that a lot of times people think about addiction treatment and what we call dual diagnosis which means that we acknowledge that for example if you have depression and you have an alcohol addiction the two are going to be synergistic and you can't just treat one so why do I drink I drink to cope so I can become sober but if my depression is untreated and I become depressed I'm going to need the alcohol to cope with the depression the flip side is even if I start let's say medication or treatment for a depression I can deal with that depression but if I keep drinking the alcohol will have a neuro neurological effect on my mood and predispose me to depression you can even get something called a substance induced mood disorder so like alcohol can in and of itself cause a depressive episode generally speaking when we think about dual diagnosis we think about mood disorders and addictions we don't think about ADHD and addiction so oftentimes that's something that's very very important you have to treat the ADHD and the addiction simultaneously is it possible to make someone more susceptible to gambling if so how do gambling sites take advantage of this it's absolutely possible to make someone more susceptible to gambling so if we go back to the psychology of how people get into gambling remember we discussed a lot of different things impulsivity impaired risk calculations illusion of control right so I don't calculate the costs I believe I can affect change there's also aspects of peer pressure and advertising and if trendy our brains are vulnerable to what's trending so how do gambling sites take advantage of this really simple right wow you win one million dollars look at all these people winning 69 000 winning and 18 Cent loss top ten streamers biggest wins of 2020 Casino ground how do they take advantage of it this is how they take advantage of it they create a culture they create a system where big streamers get to win big streamers get to win the rest will handle itself things will get clipped things will get shipped things will get shared things will get edited and it'll increase the illusion of your control it'll impair your ability to accurately predict what will happen if you spend a hundred dollars on these sites they'll do all these things automatically is it even advertising no it's not an advertisement they're not paying for an advertisement they're completely in compliance with all the laws how can we fault them they're not doing anything wrong this is the law I'm like a business that's operating well within the limit of the law I'm not doing anything illegal that's the standard right is that as a corporation I shouldn't do anything illegal great I'm adhering to that standard do loot boxes and gotcha systems count as gambling in an addiction standpoint why why are some people can't control themselves while others can stop whenever they want so let's talk about loot boxes so loot boxes are this beautiful beautiful gray area there's a part of me that doesn't really fault game developers for loot boxes because loot boxes are a natural evolution of mechanics that a hundred percent used to be okay so back in the day I was addicted to Diablo 2. and the cool thing about Diablo 2 is when you do a Boss run the boss drops a random Loot and that made the game more fun right because like random loot like random loot is fine there's no problem with random loot right we're randomizing loot we have whole games that are built on randomization like procedurally generated like what we're going to ban procedurally generated generated games because they're random just random Loot and now what we're going to do is we're going to take the random Loot and we're going to put it inside a virtualbox just a random reinforcement schedule there's nothing illegal with that in fact it's quite legal right you can buy a lottery ticket so then things got a little bit tricky because in-game items started to have real world value so I opened a treasure from the Dota 2 game and I got an item and I looked at it I was informed by the the game that this treasure sells for 600 so I was like let's sell it I don't care about Cosmetics so items sold for 600 bucks and then I had like infinite steam money for a while so then the question is is okay hold on a second is this a cosmetic item if it has real world value are you really gambling so some countries actually think so so I believe it's Belgium I may have gotten that wrong but some countries have actually started regulating they've classified loot boxes under regular gambles they've said this counts because the second we've crossed over or not the second but now that we've substantially crossed over from virtual items to real world money you're gambling for a virtual item that has no inherent value but does have an external value you're now so is that correct I'm not sure so I'm not an expert in policy but like what I do know is it's a one hell of a gray area I think we're getting closer and closer to those needing to be regulated but where is the dividing line on that like you're welcome to have an opinion I'm sure anyone out there has an opinion I don't know that your opinion is right because like then okay so like let's just do the math so if I can sell an item on eBay in a video game and someone is willing to buy it and it's not found in a loot box but it drops from a boss does that make and the boss has a random loot table does that mean that bosses and video games that have bosses with random blue tables should be regulated as gambling I don't know I mean that sounds a bit extreme to me but if you all say yes okay if you all say no like feel free to share your thoughts now there's a second part to the question why are some people why can't some people control themselves when other people why can some people control themselves and other people can't that unfortunately is a very complex question so here's how I would answer it very simply the ability to control your behavior which we'll talk about later today the ability to control your behavior has to do with trait and States there's some reasons a part of the reason why some people can control themselves is because of essentially like some things that are pretty hard to wired right so if you were grow if you grew up and your frontal lobes developed in a nice healthy way right if they grew up in the absence of mood altering substances so for example like if you didn't smoke pot before the age of 30 that has been shown to impair I mean smoking pot has been shown to a pair frontal lobe development so depending on how your brain develops if you were taught by your parents to a certain degree like delayed gratification and taught how to study and taught how to do all kinds of stuff then it can be easier to control your impulses if you are not taught those things or you were born with a brain that's ADHD or whatever then it's going to be harder for you because of your brain but that's not the whole thing so people will think oh my God that means I'm screwed no because there's a software component as well and what we've learned from Psychiatry is that the software component probably in a lot of ways is more important than the hardware component that you can take someone who has ADHD and you can do therapy with them and if you do therapy with them or you work with someone who's like an ADHD coach which is something that I hear a lot about nowadays right so we also equip our coaches with some stuff to help people get organized that you can learn particular things to compensate for whatever your brain is naturally tending towards and so there's a lot of addiction is also State based right so it's not just what you can learn but it's how you feel in the moment if I'm alone in life sitting at home all day and have nothing to look forward to it's way easier to get addicted to a substance or gambling or gaming or whatever right there's an internal emotional state which we also know very strongly neuroscientifically and there's an excellent researcher named I don't know how to pronounce this v-o-l-k-o-w volcao volco I don't know best researcher on this stuff excellent Neuroscience paper about how a lack of awareness of your internal State predisposes YouTube addiction and so if you look at the mechanisms through which meditation helps people with addiction is we learn how to become aware of our internal emotional state and we learn how to emotionally regulate ourselves and once you have those two things once you can regulate your state you no longer are going to be as vulnerable to The Addictive substance in a nutshell it's trait and state part of the way that you were born you were wired some people are luckier other people are unluckier when it comes to addiction specifically and then some people are more vulnerable because of their circumstances or even how they're feeling moment to moment I think her name is Nora volkau so if we look at if you all want to see I'm sure this is I don't know if this is the right paper but this is the right person Yep this is fantastic I think it's let's see PDF okay Lance Psychiatry is not in the public domain but like fantastic okay last question is watching people gamble dangerous can seeing others gamble make it more likely to become addictive I'm gonna go ahead and say on balance yes there is a risk to watch people gamble and that too there's some Nuance here because it's not just watching people gamble it's the way in which you watch them Gamble and what aspect of the gambling are you watching so for example watching a clip compilation of people gambling I think will probably be more harmful than watching eight hours of like someone just clicking buttons Maybe I'm Wrong so that data could show the opposite but I think if we look at some of these things like illusion of control and expectation of reward when I watch 10 clips of people hitting it big what do you think my brain learns about the likelihood that I will win it big if I see saw a clip of a hundred people losing a ton of money what would I learn if I saw a clip of 100 people winning a bunch of money what would I learn and so I do think that there is a danger to watching people gamble but that I think is also variable right so it's not like binary and so why watching a stream I mean who knows maybe watching a stream for eight hours is actually more damaging because you're getting inundated with it inundated with it inundated with it maybe you're watching it on the second screen and the only time you pay attention is when there's a big one maybe you get bombarded with the sensory stimuli and all the banners and the logos and the colors maybe that that has the worst effect I don't know but in general I'd say yes that watching people gamble will make you more prone to gambling and that's not specific to gambling by the way right so if I like watch people eat chicken nuggets I'm going to want to eat chicken nuggets if I watch people playing a video game I'm going to want to play the video games how human beings work foreign
