and if nothing happens i feel better but what happened in your situation is you were taught that no matter how good things look you should still be afraid hello hey hello dr k hello what do you go by friend um i go by honey honey nice to meet you honey yes ken and what are you working on nowadays thank you well uh the reason i i grew up today is because i want to stop having the fear of losing everything i've gained um just for yeah yeah some sounds terrible and maybe it is we'll see sounds scary um the thing is yeah it is um well i've had made many improvements in my life when i was a teenager i had us a very um a great problem with social anxiety i couldn't even talk to people and then i worked hard for it uh when i made met my boyfriend i started to improve and then i saw this community and and well that gave me a big push too and i have a great job i have a great life and i have worked so hard for everything and i'm very very happy with my life um i mean in a moment that i think even when i have new problems i know how to uh work through them and try to improve but uh sometimes i i get scared i lose some things this happens in different ways uh for example this morning i i woke up i was kind of half asleep and then i felt a bump on my arm and i was like oh no maybe i have cancer and i was like oh yeah it's not cancer it's just a mosquito bite and then my brain goes like well you don't have cancer but what about your boyfriend does he has cancer and i'm like no brain no one has cancer let's let's just stop this doesn't make sense and then i move on with my day and sometimes it's that easy uh to just move on but some other days especially when i'm working uh when i'm doing good at work i start to think um what if they i can complete the next assignment what if uh the people who trust me at work uh stop trusting in me and i i understand that sometimes these are just thoughts and this is not reality this is not what it's really happening and when i think about it uh i know i know where this comes from for how my parents raised me but still i can find a way to stop having these thoughts um they just happen randomly i can go some days without it and then one day it happens so i i think i'm lost i don't know what to do with it so here's what i'm hearing honey i'm hearing that you struggled with social anxiety you put in a lot of effort a lot of energy and a lot of time and through a lot of your hard work you've managed to develop um you know your it sounds like you're in a healthy romantic relationship it sounds like you have friends it sounds like you have a job that you're proud of it sounds that like you have a lot to be grateful for and that you've worked really hard to build a pretty good life exactly i i i think and that's why what i'm hearing is that despite that so instead of all of this progress making you feel more comfortable confident and reassured what you're noticing is that sometimes your mind still is like worried that it's all going to come falling apart yes exactly that that's uh i have great triggers also with money like oh what if you if there's every um problem in your country and then the i don't know the economy falls and then you lose your money and like well i can control that that doesn't really matter if if that ever happens but yeah my mind is all kind of thoughts in different directions like sickness money um things like that it's it's like um it's i think it's like you said it's just i feel like i'm going to lose things and i can really enjoy what i have okay that sounds terrifying right because like you said it's like it's one thing to work hard for stuff but then the whole point of working hard is that like then you get to enjoy it right yeah that's right and and so exactly it sucks to work hard and not be able to enjoy it because your brain is like hey by the way if you're a vacation this week what if like your your house gets swallowed in an earthquake [Laughter] let me ask you a couple of questions honey you said you know that you know where this comes from it has something to do with your parents can you explain that yes uh well the first thing is about death uh my parents usually have very they they are very controlling using their own health about about it um so for example when i was a kid my uh i have a sister uh they told us things like we don't have enough time and someday we were going to die see how old i'm getting uh it was too much that when we were 10 years old and my sister 11 one day they went to a party and we stayed at home and we were catholic at that time and we started praying because we were we thought my parents may die in an accident when they came back from from their party and also my father used to say many things like oh if i lose this job um i'll lose everything i owe everything i am to this company and logically i know that that wasn't true and for me i don't have exactly attachment to companies because i remember my father saying that all the time and i know i knew that wasn't true but it makes me feel like small things can make everything fall apart okay and my father was always yeah talking about um about money and how little he had but he really didn't have uh that wasn't true my father made very good income we even went on vacation to expensive place and it was fine but my father refused to to give us money uh because he said we didn't have any so that law was also like this confusion of knowing that my father had money but then saying he doesn't and as an adult that i understand how much he made that i understand that that made no sense and it was just a way to to not give us any money to my sister and me so i think that confusion of having a lot of money in your house but in practice and wanted to do to do stuff and buy stuff you don't have any that's i think that that confusion makes me think that having a lot of money doesn't mean you won't be living like a poor person okay i think that that's that's what i've seen very insightful honey so let me ask you have you ever seen a mental health professional honey i seen one when i was a teenager because my parents couldn't make me have any friends and they didn't know what to do with me but um i i think it helped me to to be able to do some stuff like to mimic um being able to not have social anxiety but i didn't fix it i was just terrified inside and doing stuff on the outside and but after that since that experience was like that for me i didn't understand anything about myself or why i was so anxious all the time i didn't try it again okay so um is it okay if i share some thoughts with you yeah sure first of all i just want to commend you on how hard you've worked and also how insightful you are um because it sounds like here i i think you're making it easy for me and i think you've you've you know done a lot of thinking about this already which helps a ton so let's start with this so i think you should definitely consider getting a clinical evaluation um you know because you you may have something like uh you know i don't we don't really know but you know you so you may have a real anxiety disorder and that's the kind of thing where like wow like that's where you know once you get diagnosed with it and you get treated for it like in eight weeks 12 weeks 16 weeks you may feel completely differently like you may feel substantially better like if you actually get like clinical treatment for it so that's definitely something that i want you to consider uh i you know i don't know if you do or you don't we're still going to talk about sort of the things that we do in the hg way which is we're going to sort of explain how your mind works and things like that but i want to make it clear that a lot of you may get a lot of benefit out of actually clinical evaluation and treatment with me so far okay so just something to consider okay especially when you're kind of talking about it it seems like you're not worried about anything it seems like your mind is almost always worried and just picks different things to be worried about yes does that make sense so it's almost like the worry is like independent of the problem like today the worry is going to pick this and tomorrow the worry is going to pick this and the next day though oh there's a bump on my arm i guess we're worrying about cancer today there's no bump on my arm what else can be worried what we'd be worried about oh i know we can be worried about the economy if we're not worried about the economy today i know we can be worried about our boyfriend right yeah so let me let's start with with this so you were taught to be afraid right yes so normally so let's forget about your upbringing for a second if i'm afraid of something and nothing bad happens what happens to my fear this may be a hard question for you yeah it's very hard for me it's it's actually hard for me okay sometimes i would say go away but sometimes it just comes back later great so i know that's hard for you so the the answer is if you're raised in a normal environment it goes away right so like if i'm worried about a snake being in my toilet and pardoned apologies to everyone out there who who you know now is gonna be worried about that and i walk inside and i don't see a snake in my toilet that fear will go away right so generally speaking if we think about the human brain if i'm afraid of something and it happens that reinforces the fear does that make sense yes it does make sense and if i'm afraid of something and it doesn't happen then that reduces the fear the fear goes down i know it may not be that way for you but does that make sense in general yes yes makes sense now it sounds like you grew up in a really really tricky situation where there was plenty of fear that was disconnected from reality yes right yes so your dad is like oh my god i'm going to lose my job let's go on vacation to a fancy place because we actually have plenty of money so what your mind actually learned so i've seen this a lot and there's actually studies that show that if you have a parent with an anxiety disorder we have no idea whether your dad actually has an anxiety disorder or not we don't know whether you have an anxiety disorder or not but there are studies that show if you have a parent who has an anxiety problem and you have a child who has an anxiety problem providing treatment to the parent reduces the child's anxiety so if you give a parent anti-anxiety medication the effect you see in the child is the same as if you were to medicate the child so the benefit that a child gets from medication you don't have to give the child the medication you just give the parent the medication and the child improves by the same amount and so we know that there's there's a very very strong relationship between parental anxiety and the child's anxiety and essentially i think what happened with you is that despite being reassured you were still told to be afraid so what's happened is your fear even though you have nothing to worry about your your dad was still worrying which means that your brain learned that that reassurance has no impact on the fear does that make sense so yeah so yes that makes much sense so normal people i'm afraid and if nothing happens i feel better but what happened in your situation is you were taught that no matter how good things look you should still be afraid even if we have plenty of money it could be gone tomorrow and so what's happened now is that in situations where i've seen people like this i mean we're not 100 sure this is what's going on with you but may fit is that the fear has become completely divorced from reality yes right because you're not like reassured because like there was nothing to worry about and your dad was like be afraid be afraid be afraid and your brain is looking around and you're like i'm confused what am i supposed to be afraid of there's nothing to be afraid of and your dad is like no no you have to be afraid and then you were like wait but if if i if there's reassuring stuff and i should still be afraid that disconnects reality from my fear does that make sense yes yes makes so much sense and and then what happens with your dad is like you someone in chat said this and i was gonna say the same thing you're waiting for the other shoe to drop have you heard that phrase before yes and that's how it feels like right so what you've learned is that no matter how much reassuring stuff you get in life everything could go wrong in a moment's notice and so that fear almost becomes independent and now the confusing thing is the fear doesn't like it doesn't know what to stick on to because everything in your life seems to be going pretty well you got a nice boyfriend you got a nice job you're doing better you're social you're doing you're living your life and there's so much fun and then the fear is sitting there and it's confused and it's like wait we have to be scared of something because and even though everything around us in reality is good like we divorced ourselves from that a long time ago and dad taught us that going to a party we better pray to god because they're going to die on the way home yes right and so now that your mind is divorced from it what it's doing is it's latching on to whatever it can find oh there's a bump on your arm must be cancer whew we found something to be scared of [Laughter] yes yes it's true so it's almost like it makes so much sense it's like an automatic pattern in your mind where your fear is looking for something now the tricky thing here is okay so what do we do about it so the first question that i have for you is have you noticed a change in how often or how intense the severe is over time yes um since i've been with my boyfriend who he well he had a very nice upbringing and he's very secure in those things he also um i used to get triggered when he spent his money at star and right now that doesn't happen but uh since i've been with him it's been uh so much less uh so much that this morning when the bomb thing happened i was able to detach from it uh quickly but before uh well we've been together for some years so when we started dating uh that thought would have been on my mind all day and right now that doesn't happen so it's it's seriously improving and it's happening less but still there yeah okay good so that's i'm happy to hear that and that's what i would expect because here's the thing to understand when your fear is separate from reality you need something to feed it and in your case it sounds like your parental upbringing was like feeding your fear right and so what we tend to see oftentimes is that when kids grow up with a particular like inherited problem not genetically but like you know when they grow up with something like this the more they spend time in the real world and away from the paranoid parents the less serious it becomes so like now what's happening is you're getting you're getting like reality testing right so your brain is learning oh wait a minute like we actually like don't need to be worried about that and the more that you just sort of like live separately from your parents and i'm happy to hear that especially your boyfriend it sounds like is a positive influence that's also very common but as as basically as your brain has your own experiences it'll naturally start to forget over time so the one thing if it's moving in the right direction i'd say just be careful about how much time you spend with your parents and like be careful about you know spending time with people who are a little bit more grounded in reality and the more that you sort of live your own life like the better the fear will become okay with me so far yes yes i think um i'm with you so far and also i've been separated from my parents because what you say makes so much sense uh now i i got to understand something i i couldn't understand about myself i was trying to distanciate from my parents for a long time and started to get very anxious when i thought on talking to them and i think this may be part of it like that feeling that everything goes into chaos again when when i talk to them yep right so like because you're i mean yeah so i think you're going to kind of absorb their anxiety which we oftentimes find some people are kind of like that where they're like a little bit more absorbent um so another thing when you're ready uh honey is the other thing that you can try to do this this sometimes works have a conversation with your dad about his fear and i know this sounds kind of weird because we're trying to keep distance from them but sometimes it can actually be very very eye-opening to be like really objective and calm and just listen to your dad talk about how irrational his fears are right okay right so like like when you actually talk to him you'll realize like wow this is incredibly crazy and as your own brain matures and you're able to sort of like judge that you may actually be able to like get distance from it in your own mind because if you as you talk to him and you can sort of have like open-ended conversation right you're not trying to be judgmental you're just going to ask dad so that you know when we were growing up you seemed really concerned about money can you help me understand that why were you always so concerned about money how long have you been concerned about money so one thing that was kind of confusing for me dad is that you were worried about money but we actually like took a lot of really nice trips we had a nice upbringing like help me understand because it seemed like in a lot of ways we were okay but you always seemed worried about it can you help me understand that and then the more that you kind of talk to him what you'll start to see is like the irrational fears like coming out right and you don't want to get sucked into that yes and the interesting thing is that when when you talk to your dad if you're not careful he'll slip into the same pattern of oh like you have to be careful honey you have to be careful you can't trust anyone everything is gonna so you don't so so if you but the interesting thing is if you start asking him about his life and his experience and his views it's going to feel very different does that make sense it's not going to be like the autopilot conversation yes yes i understand because i talk to him and hear his fears but it's like i'm running away from hearing it exactly so this is this is the opposite and that that may be very yep but the key thing is that you don't want to get swept up by his stuff right you want to try to control the conversation and you want to listen and as you listen to him just be careful with what happens within you if you feel yourself getting triggered and stuff like that pull yourself away from the conversation you may not be ready for it yet but eventually what i'd love is if you can have a conversation where you can like hear him and also like be calm yourself like don't get sucked into it so that you can really kind of see like how how hard this has been for him and you can even say things like oh dad it sounds like it's been very hard for you worrying all of these years and i can see that you worry about us today too that sounds really really hard and then he may start crying or whatever like you never know right and then like you're gonna give him a hug and then y'all will like you know cry together and then it's gonna feel weird and but like hopefully at the end of it both y'all will feel better being him maybe he'll start screaming at the middle because he don't want to get more questions that happens too yeah so so that's why you want to be so you then be extra careful but you want to be like open-ended and non-judgmental right so so and like give it a shot yes i understand but i think honey just to kind of um you know recap so the first thing i i'd seriously consider getting a clinical evaluation second thing to kind of understand is that you know essentially your mind normally your mind thinks that fear is tied to reality and gets reinforced through what happens in the real world the interesting thing is that despite the real world telling you hey everything is okay everything is okay everything is okay it sounds like your parents really contradicted that and they were like no no it's not okay you can't trust the world honey you can't trust the world and the more that you started to do that then what happens is your mind is like okay we can't trust the world in terms of like reassuring so we've got to be scared no matter what nothing the world can do will ever put us at ease because we can't trust the world yes yes that's that's very accurate how am i right well my parents are yes and and so you carried some of that with you but the good news is as we grow into adults and we form our own relationships and we learn our own lessons as you keep on doing that i think this problem will slowly get better and better and better and the last thing if you ever want to really do this it can be a little bit more intense is that you can have a conversation with your dad where you really listen to what he's saying and then you judge for yourself like how irrational it sounds and sometimes doing that can help you with your own irrational thoughts and you can even sort of say oh there's the voice of my dad it's not even my voice this is the voice of my dad that i'm hearing within me that's an echo from all the times he's talked to me in the past and that can be quite healing to do okay yeah that's amazing i could never thought of that it's great thank you dr k of course good luck honey thank you and um thanks for all the work you've done i learned a lot from you uh not just for me for myself but to understand others and great and be able to to really listen and not try to guess what everyone's thinking so thank you smart seriously good luck to you thank you take care bye bye all right so let's do a quick recap so the tricky thing is sometimes our mind has this part that's just always afraid is always afraid of the other shoe dropping and it's kind of weird right because normally if we're afraid of something and it doesn't happen we should calm down like when reality does not mirror our fears we should be reassured oh i'm afraid that you know some a meteor is gonna fall out of the sky and then a couple hours go by no meteor falls out of the sky and then i'm like okay i don't need to worry that's normally what should happen with a fear right is that a fear will either be reinforced by reality and then our brain learns oh wait i do need to worry about this or our fear will be reassured by reality because the thing that action doesn't happen and then our mind is like okay we don't need to worry about that the tricky thing is that sometimes our fears seem completely divorced from reality and actually what can happen if we tunnel down into this sometimes what we find is that early on despite the fact that reality is reassuring you you were taught to still be afraid often times by a parental figure someone in your life was like you can't trust reality you can't trust reality you can't trust reality and as you internalize that lesson then you're kind of screwed because all of the fears that you have can never be reassured because the real world no longer like counteracts your fear and so we carry this fear with us over and over and over again and the weird thing about the fear is that since there's nothing to actually be afraid of it kind of like looks for whatever it can find so on a particular day it'll be afraid of this on another day it'll be afraid of that oh we've got a bump on our arm maybe it's cancer oh no it's a mosquito bite so we're not worried about that anymore let me worry about something else so it's like the fear exists as an emotion and is looking for a manifestation and it finds whatever small signal it can in the real world and puts all of the emotional energy into that weird little signal oh so-and-so didn't text me back maybe there they had a heart attack oh my god right that's what the the fear does so what do you do about this the first thing to understand is that sometimes this is what a clinical anxiety disorder manifests as so sometimes if it's focused on on being sick and things like that we call that illness anxiety disorder sometimes it can also be uh generalized anxiety disorder where we sort of think about people as worriers right so they worry about all kinds of different stuff that's why we call it generalized anxiety disorder it's not focal on a particular area so it's worth getting clinically evaluated if this kind of like falls into your experience and the other thing to kind of recognize is that like over time you have to be really careful about what influences taught you that reality and fear are like two completely separate things and ideally as you start to live life a little bit form additional relationships have additional experiences your brain can start to learn oh it actually turns out that reality and fear is connected and the more that you can sort of connect to those the more oddly enough the fear will actually go down so great call you
