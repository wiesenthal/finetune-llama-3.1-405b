you know there's an argument to be made that since we don't use marijuana we don't really understand the benefits and we don't really understand what we're talking about how would you what do you think about that would hate for us as doctors to like recommend something and then all of a sudden we find out later how bad it is and we've seen that being the case for opioids let's say i've got depression or ptsd and people say like oh i you know i use marijuana to cope what do you think about that again you know the studies are limited it's very difficult to study cannabis in the us it's still a schedule one driller meaning has high abuse potential in the same category as lsd you know if if i'm using a substance just at a very high level if i'm using a substance to numb my emotional state my brain's ability to control and regulate my emotional state becomes less necessary um how do you know if you're kind of like addicted to marijuana or not am i is this live or is this still part no we're live okay we're good to go okay so i'm gonna go ahead and switch over so people why don't we just start uh welcome michael or dr shu how do i how do we pronounce your last name yeah dr shu you um you said it just right the first time okay um so yeah do you want to say a couple quick things up front maybe sure i think first of all just a quick uh disclaimer for viewers one thing is that um you know i recently joined the scientific advisory board of healthy gamer didn't want to put that out there um and i know that's something that might be announced later on this week as well sure um i am you know a physician at brigham women's hospital um and part of the harvard medical school sort of residency training program here but all the opinions that i'm going to put out here are mine mind alone and um you know i think uh there's a lot uh to talk about with cannabis and i think there's sort of ways that people are talking about in terms of how it's like a completely harmless substance and i think you know that may not that's you know not sort of a helpful way of thinking about it but at the same time i might challenge something you said a little bit earlier too that it's a completely bad thing as well and i think that sort of the truth is probably somewhere in the middle and sure i hope we can sort of uh be able to converse around that um today and uh sort of also uh acknowledging you know both uh both of us are psychiatrists so there's always sort of biases that we have you know going into these things we have biases towards mental health and health in general um you know some people might have biases towards autonomy or freedom of choice and things like that or biases based on personal experience um yet biases based on you know looking to evidence of literature which i believe is the right thing to do when you're talking about drugs maybe not so much spiritual experiences or things like that that don't have sort of the harmful effects that drugs could have but certainly when thinking about medications and drugs i think it's helpful to um to do that um and bias is based on obviously personal and spiritual experience and i think it's just helpful to put out there sort of what our biases are because without acknowledging that arriving at the truth might be a little bit challenging and i think acknowledging all of our violence is in it so well said i mean i i think when i have conversations with people about marijuana oftentimes it's interesting you use the word bias whereas i wonder if like value i mean i think there are biases but also like there are differing values so like as mental health professionals we're probably going to have a value that health is not i wouldn't say actually i i don't think i value necessarily health over autonomy because ultimately when i work with many patients you know it's their choice what they put into their bodies but at the same time i think like you said i've sort of noticed that sometimes people are kind of coming with a certain personal experience i wouldn't quite say agenda but sometimes when i work with people who use substances the conversation almost turns into looking for any kind of justification to be able to continue to use the substance um that's been my experience sometimes with people so i i really appreciate you kind of pointing out biases and how people are coming at it from different angles and so if we're trying to figure out what's right or not right that we have to really consider the personal perspectives of the people involved and that the right answer for one person may not be the right answer for someone else yeah i think that's that's well said and you know i think we all sort of value autonomy we value health and i think some people might value one certain things over others and i think that's just what yeah yeah exactly so uh michael let me just start by so can you just tell us a little bit about marijuana like sure just in terms of uh like do you want to dive to you want to die for like specific questions or you want to talk generally first what do you think would be better um well i think one thing that would be helpful to sort of lay out there alphabet is just sort of definitions and word choice sure um and i think it's helpful to think about you know marijuana is such a broad term and even like the term medical marijuana can sort of be unhelpful because like what are we talking about here are we talking about like recreational marijuana that's used for medical purposes are we talking about prescribed cannabinoids that are used for medical purposes are we using are we talking about like medical marijuana cards that we're getting and using for medical purposes so i think it's sort of helpful to sort of break down what are the different types of substances that marijuana contains one of the different forms of it and sort of how yeah that would be awesome can you tell us that yeah so it says marijuana what are the different things that that could refer to sure i mean i think one thing to think about is like first off that there's sort of this whole plant version of cannabis and that's sort of the traditional uh sort of way that we that one might sort of inhale or smoke it and you know there's different versions of it um certainly the thing is sort of the most commonly talked about are like sativa or indica versions there's other types of whole plants that might include tarpons which are like oils from like animal or plant products that might affect the aroma or the taste of those products as well and you know these whole plant cannabis products i think what a lot of people don't realize is that it contains like hundreds of cannabinoids in them like hundreds of chemicals that um that are potentially sort of psychoactive and so we don't we haven't really scratched the surface in terms of what many of them do but what the most common ones that we have been able to isolate and do a little bit of research on are things like delta nine uh thc which is sort of what we think about in terms of thc there's delta eight which is sort of less studied and sort of less available and the whole plan as well there's also cbd kind of can have a dial which is sort of something that's sort of a lot of excitement around a lot of media attention and things like that around cbd and then you also have cannabinol as well which is sort of an emerging area so i think it's sort of helpful to think about like whole plants and there's different ways to take that whether it be sort of inhaled or whether it be through edible use or or sort of other means and then you have like these other cannabin cannabinoids uh these sort of uh compounds that you can sense you can sort of uh distill out of out of the cannabis products that can be created or made into drugs that contain only sort of those types of uh cannabinoids uh some for example drenavinol also known as marinol is a synthetic form of thc epidiolex which is like the only uh fda approved version of cbd that we have currently on the market the only one that we've studied um you know that's um you know that's cbd that's from synthesized so it's kind of helpful to think about you know what are the different products you know cbd can be used in edibles and other oils and tinctures and i'm happy to get into the weeds of that if we need to but i think it's helpful so michael let me just ask you this so so in terms of when so one of the things that i remember learning when i was in residency is that a lot of the original research on marijuana was done like 30 or 40 years ago and that there's been like um basically as marijuana became more of a controlled substance at least in the united states that the amount of research on it like maybe in the 90s and early 2000s basically like kind of decreased significantly and so one of the takeaways i remember having through some of my lectures when i was learning about this stuff is that the studies that we have on marijuana are maybe less applicable now because over the last 30 years we've bred more potent strains uh concentrated the amount of thc so that even like so so in a sense the the effects of marijuana that we sort of have well characterized from the 60s and 70s may not be quite as applicable today like can you comment on that or is that kind of your experience because i'm i i don't keep up too too heavily i'm sure not as much as you do in terms of marijuana research yeah absolutely that's i think that's exactly right i mean when people talk about marijuana that's been used for thousands of years we think about like china being using it in 2000 bc for things like rheumatoid pain um or other sources of pain or even sort of uh mental health reasons you know the type of cannabis that was naturally growing in china or like southern russia like had very little content of like thc and you know we're talking about like less than two or three percent um fast forward you know to the 60s or 70s you know people are using cannabis pretty widely uh sort of um around the streets we might have you know hear people say like back you know back in the day people are using all the time it's not super harmful like and um using it recreationally and you know even around that time like the thc average content you would found on the streets of somewhere around three to five percent um fast forward to today and i think a lot of this has to do with um sort of the big industry of cannabis and sort of how we see trends in other areas of substance as well in the sense that you know trending towards higher potency and higher use and and sort of desire to create those products you know a lot of uh if you're looking for like for example whole plant cannabis like the stuff that people are using in the streets back in the 70s the average nowadays is like 20 30 and certain vapes can even go up and other products can go up to 60 90 so we're talking the products that we're talking about today that are people are using and wondering if it could be helpful for mental health purposes are totally different from the things that you know we were talking about back in those days and so just doing research off of just so to make sure i understood that correctly like so when we're talking about like 60s and 70s or even like ancient cannabis use we're talking thc in the you said two to three percent range two to three percent a lot of it's sort of like hash she should like um sort of derive from the natural plant itself and a lot of that you know has a lot of cbd and a higher cbd to thc ratio potentially as well um but you know strains of the higher thc content have been bred and used a lot more commonly and less and so you said that the the thc concentration now is like 20 to 30 so we're talking about like a ten-fold increase in potency absolutely yeah and then even in vapes and stuff you can you can get a 20-fold or 30-fold increase in yeah when you get a hit or a dab of that and potency exactly you're getting what you're taking in that moment is is much higher than people were ever sort of using in terms of concentration and you said that has to do with the industry can you talk a little bit about that what do you mean by the industry yeah i mean there's a lot of sort of opinions on this and why this may be the case but i mean one thing to think about is you know as weed was sort of decriminalized and um legalized in many of the states and i think uh people were really like hoping that uh sort of these dispensaries could be opened by like grassroots and that sort of treatment and healing can be taken by the people and there's sort of this anti-government even this whole rhetoric around that and i think it's kind of uh unfortunate that with the legalization of medical marijuana on a state estate basis that a lot of the sort of dispensary licenses that are being handed out are being given to large industry cannabis dealers which many of which have been bought out by tobacco by big tobacco and big tobacco as sort of many of us know are incredibly good at marketing they're incredibly good at social marketing they're fairly good at like you know you know coming up with ways of sort of mitigating sort of the ideas of how something could be harmful and trying to play up some of the ideas of how something could be helpful and so i think that's a part of it and another part of it is you know uh cannabis use also sort of like it follows demand as well and we see i mean we look at the opioid sort of crisis you know and thinking about like what's available on the streets you know there used to be you know a lot of times it used to be like heroin on the streets and then sort of drug dealers were realizing that you know if they can increase the potency of opioids on the street the more people will buy and then more people will get sort of hooked on it and there's also sort of this tolerance that develops on opioids as well whereas where like the more you use it the more sort of desensitized the receptors in your brain are to using opioids so the more you kind of need in order to get the same effect so what drug dealers were realizing is that you know people need higher higher doses and potency of opioids and and today if you look on the streets there's almost no like heroin at least here in massachusetts it's like mostly fentanyl and fentanyl is again by orders of like 10 degrees or like a higher much higher order potency than even heroin was and that's why part of the reason why we're seeing a huge increase in overdoses on opioids as well and i think you know when thinking about um substances that where you can develop tolerance and substance kids that that sort of people are trying to um either potentially chase a symptom down or chase like a high you know and develop tolerance over time there's going to be a demand for and i think industry kind of knows this and i suspect that the potency in cannabis will get higher higher and that might help explain it but that's only part of the picture yeah so so michael you're kind of so if i'm hearing you correctly like one thing is that as we increase potency and it's interesting i didn't know that big tobacco had purchased a lot first of all i didn't know much about the landscape of cannabis dispensaries and stuff but i mean if big tobacco has essentially like purchased those and are kind of disseminating them it makes me really wonder about as you mentioned they're good at marketing like you know how much of what we hear about the benefits of marijuana and things like that are a result of marketing or other things like that i'm also curious so so as potency kind of increases some people will say that marijuana cannot be addictive um do you have thoughts about that yeah i mean we've certainly seen um cannabis addiction in our clinics here and what we know about sort of addiction to cannabis is that not everyone gets it but uh the more the more you use um thc containing products typically we're talking about like either you know the inhalable versions of whole plant cannabis or vapes and the more that you use it the more frequently they use it and the higher content of thc in these products lends to a higher chance that you might develop addiction to it and people that do use it frequently say over two or three times a week we see around like 30 percent of people developing an addiction to it and i think you sort of talked about a little bit of the mechanism of addiction and cannabis on the stream before um yeah why don't you just tell us a little bit about that so like like so a lot of people will say you know um i don't i use marijuana for medical reasons like i i you know because it is it is decriminalized now you can get medical marijuana cards at least in the united states and so like what do you you know how do you tell if someone is using it and oftentimes people who use it for medical reasons won't be it won't be prescribed they'll have never seen a mental health provider they'll sort of say oh i have anxiety and like marijuana helps with anxiety and that's why i use it um how do you know if you're kind of like addicted to marijuana or not oh i'm not hearing anything are you all hearing anything did we get jim muted somehow hello say something hello hello yeah there we go keep going so can you tell us how how you determine if someone's addicted sure um i mean some of the signs that someone could be potentially addicted to cannabis are one having cravings especially early morning cravings like waking up to wanting cannabis as soon as you get up that's a potential sign another is using cannabis despite sort of knowing the consequences of it so examples of that are like you know i've patients who have been using cannabis for a long time and it's impairing their work and as they use cannabis more and more and become more dependent on they were taking more and more risks with cannabis like using it right before meetings at work or during meetings even or stepping away and knowing that it's impairing their ability to function at their job but sort of not being able to determine like be able to make a sort of decision on that and that goes back to the neurobiology of addiction that we make it to at some point but um also um what else using higher and higher doses of it over time what about like i mean what about people who say like let's say i have anxiety at work and i find that you know actually like using marijuana at work like helps me perform better in a meeting okay so i think it really depends again on this what we're talking about when we're talking cannabis in this moment so you know we know that there's some evidence that sort of um cbd or higher cbd ratio uh cannabis products or even sort of um sort of the newer kind of cannabis products are using kind of this entourage effect of various different terpenes and cannabis products to sort of lower the rate of getting high or the the chance of getting high while minimizing the psychoactive elements of cannabis like thc and sort of the addictive potential that thc has and using utilizing other sort of cannabinoids that could be potentially helpful for social anxiety there there are some early evidence trials that that some of these products could potentially be helpful for social anxiety but again um i think one thing to mention here we'll just take the example of social anxiety that you know in the studies that we have for social anxiety and other anxiety and depression especially we'll just focus on cbd for now um cbd edible products for this are but you could probably also apply for inhalable versions of high cbd to thc ratio products is that um what we see in these studies is that and we're trying to still figure out the dose range for these elements for treating these symptoms but what we see is that oftentimes you know in order to get a therapeutic effect you need a certain on on a magnitude of like hundreds of cbd milligram and milligrams to sort of get the desired effect of some of these uh products but um a lot of sort of what we're seeing and at least from my experience even going to dispensaries is that a lot of these products that are being sold at dispensaries um have a range of like five to ten milligrams of cbd and you know you really don't know what you're getting out of these uh dispensary products either because it's not it's not regulated so it's really frustrating it's frustrating for me as a clinician in terms of helping a patient to navigate through using cbd knowing that sort of it's an unregulated space and there was sort of this study done out of uh mississippi i believe that we're looking at different cannabis dispensaries and their cbd products and they looked at 25 different products of cbd um at a dispensary and um only three out of the 25 and they were measuring the cbd and and sort of the thc content of these different products and only three out of 25 of those products specifically in that area had cbd content that was like within 20 of what they were saying wow and there were like some products that were like that had zero percent of like cbd and it was just pure like berry gummies or something and i think part of the you know i think part of what i'm getting at is like one the sort of frustration of working in this space it's kind of like it kind of reminds me of i can like old school runescape or like diablo days where you're like trying to make trades and things like that but everyone out there guys have to scam you like after every 10 people who actually wants to make a good trade with you i've gotten scammed like numerous times in the runescape trying to trade irons but like i ended up somehow uh in the wilderness somewhere and someone kills me i'm like how the heck did i fall for this one again and it's like it's like the wild west out there and like the fda has shut down like anyway that's shut down or not shut down but they've really worn they've worn sort of these dispensaries based off of it and i'm getting back to my point and that is that um the reason that we're seeing um even people who are taking this i believe we're seeing even people are taking this completely sub therapeutic doses meaning like 5 milligrams or zero milligrams of cbd and reporting like oh my anxiety is so much better like i'm getting you know i'm feeling so much better and i think we really have to acknowledge that there's a huge placebo effect that we see um even in our like clinical trials for antidepressants i mean we're talking about like even thinking about like the uh effects of antidepressants on depression like about half of that effect is is sort of due to placebo meaning like like even if you just gave like 100 people with social anxiety or with depression water pills there was going to be a certain proportion 20 30 40 of those people would say like this is this is great this is really working for me and you know yeah so this i can i can totally see how if people like marijuana the placebo effect from the therapeutic dose would be very high yeah it's twice as high i think studies show that like if you believe something's gonna work like it the likelihood of it actually working is twice as high so you have not only are you getting water pill but you're you're being told by somebody that it's gonna help with anxiety there's a chance that it'll certainly help and there's a much higher chance than if you were just giving a water pill on its own so so michael just like so let's just let me ask a question so let's say i've got depression or ptsd and people say like oh i you know i use marijuana to cope what do you think about that yeah um i think i'll start with ptsd um i think ptsd is a hot topic for cannabis i think anywhere between like a third and like a half of people who are getting medical marijuana cards put down ptsd as their reason so it's it's definitely something out there and you know i i really wish i could say and i'm going to be focusing first on whole plant cannabis for now but you know i really wish i could say that like it's effective for ptsd but but honestly the trials have not really panned out well again you know the studies are limited it's very difficult to study cannabis in the u.s it's still a schedule one drug meaning it has high abuse potential in the same category as lsd for example um and so doing any clinical trials with it is very difficult to say the least but at the same time what we've seen is that you know in studies for example there are two big studies out of the veterans affairs hospitals where they tracked people who had ptsd symptoms and started using cannabis and over time people who use more cannabis and more and used it more frequently this is again talking about whole plant smoked cannabis the higher thc content and the more that they were using it the worse and the worsening of their symptoms over time and one study even showed out of like it was like a few hundred patients that they looked at when they stopped using cannabis many of them actually got had improvement in nightmares and anxiety and then so you so you wonder like you know why is it that we hear um you know a lot of people with ptsd find some sort of reprieve from whole plants smoked cannabis and feel like they're you know really improving their functional lifestyle but why is it that this is not panning out in the studies in the same way that even other psychedelics or antidepressants are are panning out in the site it's like why is there this like discrepancy here and i think you know it's it's still sort of unclear but i think if we dive into the neurobiology of it um it starts making sense how so i'm gonna do that so all right so um so cannabis let's start with like thc um thc operates on a receptor in the body called cv1 and cv1 is located in many different places in the central nervous system one of those places is located on is the amygdala so we know that sort of low doses at low doses of thc what happens is that there seems to be sort of an anxiolytic effect to the to cannabis um for example you know they've tried to take they've tried to extract just thc into a pill called nabalone and very small doses like 7.5 milligrams may be helpful for anxiety and stress and stress symptoms but what happens is that at higher doses of thc the effect on the cb1 receptor actually flips we see that it can create anxiogenic effects on the amygdala and the amygdala again is is our fear center it's it's sort of our emotion center right and so thinking about like the short-term effects on trauma and ptsd and i think you might have mentioned this on stream outlook maybe once like in that some patients especially in the initial dose of a whole plan cannabis can have a anxiety response or even a trauma a traumatic response and that can linger over time so there's definitely a risk to that then sort of what people were saying before for a while is that like okay if you get past that first stage things start getting better for you and neurobiologically what is going on there is that um the receptors on let's pause for a second michael let's just make sure we recap okay so our amygdala so i i noticed you're using some terminology so let's explain that so the amygdala is your fear and survival center of the brain so when we experience negative emotions oftentimes our amygdala is acting up or is lit up right so when it's active we'll experience things like fear um you mentioned anxiolytic and anxiogenic so anxiolytic is the term anxio which is anxiety and lytic which means to lyse or break apart and so anxiolytic agents are things that reduce anxiety or break down anxiety break apart anxiety and anxiogenic are things that generate anxiety so if i heard you correctly there's a cb1 receptor which is a particular kind of cannabinoid receptor that's found in the amygdala which is our fear center of the brain and at low doses of thc what that essentially does is acts on that receptor and reduces the amount of anxiety we feel is that correct yeah the problem is that at higher doses it appears that the effect on the receptor changes which for people who are out there listening is common that at low doses like particular you know pharmacological or like herbal compounds will work in a particular way and then at higher doses they'll start to work in different ways or even they'll start to act on other receptors and so if we take like low-dose thc it may have some kind of anxiety-reducing property but at higher doses of thc it actually makes people feel more anxious and can almost have like a negative experience or traumatic experience is that fair to say yeah that's that's fair to say and and can i just ask one or two questions about that real quick so you're familiar with k2 i'm sure because you're doing residency in boston and i did res can you tell us a little bit about what k2 is like chemically well uh my understanding of k2 is that it's a synthetic form of basically a cannabinoid so so when i was like working in emergency rooms in boston several years ago i remember seeing people who used k2 and they would be like very very paranoid very afraid and like quite psychotic and delusional do you have any idea if k2 acts kind of in the same way that you're talking about where it like hyperactivates uh cb1 like do we know anything about how k2 works cause like k2 seems to induce i've worked with patients who will have k2 and then it's a synthetic cannabinoid and they'll have like ptsd after using it yeah absolutely i mean yeah i've seen this too as well you know we had a patient who took k2 really high functioning woman and developed some really bad really bad psychotic trip and had to get electroconvulsive therapy for weeks before they were sort of able to come down to somewhat sort of baseline and you know i i'm not entirely sure in the mechanism of k2 but it makes sense to me that it's probably working once in a similar way on the cb1 receptor and you know i haven't mentioned that cb the cb1 receptor is on multiple areas of the brain both like we talked about the amygdala also in like the frontal cortex where a lot of our decision making sort of our ability to like navigate things our visual spatial our motivation drive all of that a lot of those things as well as regulating our emotions a lot of those centers are in the frontal cortex there's a lot of cb1 receptors there and there's also cb1 receptors in our temporal lobes and these are the areas where you know that that are associated with visual effects or even like potential like psychotic effects and we see um sort of that that function as well so um absolutely i think they're they're very related so you were saying um so just uh so at higher doses of thc we can get kind of anxiogenic or like it almost creates anxiety or paranoia or things like that and how does that relate to ptsd again yeah so um what i was getting at is that what happens is um that once you get past that hump and people say like okay the first trip might be bad but if you keep trying it you won't have bad trips anymore okay and like you start developing tolerance and it gets better and maybe even starts helping the symptoms but um what happens is um that's i'm gonna give an example like like ganking and moba and like league of legends or in dota right like if somebody is somebody's calling for a gank once and and you're like there's a reason for it you'll go to the lane and you'll help them out with ganking but if if somebody's like asking for a gank every two minutes because like oh my god like this is a terrible matchup i need your help so badly we're never gonna win like what happened since you start getting desensitized to listening to to this person asking for your gank for a gig and you're like all right i do i like i cannot keep ganking your lane we're just gonna lose the game and i also just like hearing your voice is really troubling so you know we see the same thing happen with receptors like the more you the more you activate the cv1 receptor the it sort of desensitizes it to to um to the the cannabinoid and it down regulates i mean there's there's less receptors as well so i know this is getting deep into the science and i'll get to why you know why i think it's important and one thing is that over time we see that there's also the cb1 receptors on the part of the brain that regulates emotion so this is called the ventromedial prefrontal cortex and stepping back a bit and thinking about like trauma and like ptsd a lot of you know trauma is our inability to overcome some overwhelming situation or or um or emotion and our inability to process that and trauma a lot of sort of like when i understand like when i trauma when i call for a gank on my lane over and over and over again and no one shows up what i said uh you i was just making a joke i was like you're like you were saying that trauma is our inability to overcome a profound emotional experience and i was just saying like when i'm calling for ganks over and over and over again my team is afk that's that that is all the drama yeah okay um so trauma is you know it a a uh and tell me if i need to clarify things but there's a part again it's it's where our amygdala is over firing and there's we lose a connection with the part of our brain that regulates emotion the ventral amino prefrontal cortex so we're firing the middle amygdala on its own and we lose this connection so in terms of treating ptsd we want to strengthen these connections between the part of our brain that can process the motions and the feeling of the motion itself we um that's this kind of simply so how does how does how do cannabinoids fit into that the ability for our frontal lobes to control or process our emotional experience so what we see in ptsd is that over the long over the long term because you have a desensitization of receptors on the ventral medial prefrontal cortex the um the actual amount of neurons neuronal density in that part of your brain actually decreases so the part of so the part of your brain that is there to regulate and identify negative emotions becomes desensitized and decreases in size interesting so ventromedial prefrontal cortex shrinks if you use marijuana regularly yeah no this we yeah this is sort of imaging studies that have sort of suggested this and and what i'm trying to get at here is that um is that what happens when you when you take uh sort of high thc products of the long term is that a lot of times you experience uh people experience sort of this emotional blunting and sort of a difficulty being able to regulate the emotion itself their perception of the emotion of trauma and these symptoms can go down but um we're not actually addressing the underlying issue which which is through the work of being able to regulate these emotions interesting so no i'm making sense yeah let me just see if i i kind of got you so and i i think this kind of makes sense so you know if if i'm using a substance just at a very high level if i'm using a substance to numb my emotional state my brain's ability to control and regulate my emotional state becomes less necessary right if i'm numbing it like my my ventromedial prefrontal cortex doesn't need to do anything yeah and as a result like so gen i mean i don't know if we're really talking about atrophy or this is you know if we're talking about fmri studies i don't think anyone is looking at one patient longitudinally right it's like average taking a hundred people who use marijuana versus a hundred people who don't use marijuana and comparing the relative averages of their brain size in this area so i think sort of what i what i would assume is that you know if our brain doesn't need to regulate our emotions the part of our brain that regulates emotions kind of like checks out and possibly is smaller or something like that right and so we don't need to regulate our emotions the thing that i'm kind of curious about which you sort of already answered in a sense is that so i'm kind of curious michael do you think that it's people who have more trouble regulating emotions those are the ones who reach towards marijuana because they need a substance or like since if if i have an inability to regulate my internal emotional state is that the cause of me using marijuana or is that a consequence of me using marijuana to numb myself and therefore like don't need to develop that part of my brain as much like what do you think a little bit of both probably a little bit of both and yeah i think we see that um now in other realms of research as well for example um in in terms of uh uh in terms of looking at how isolation during the pandemic affects substance use and we see that people who feel a lot more isolated during the pandemic might have an even higher like reward response to using substances themselves as well and it might sort of go to substances as a way almost to help them self-regulate um too and yeah there's actually this interesting article on at the new on the new york times um that was talking about how like opioids which is sort of you know different a different beast than than cannabis but talking about how uh people sort of view their relationship with opioid like like that of a good friend in that like over time you sort of develop an attachment the substance um and a lot of that has to do with um you know the substance being the sort of the pseudo person that's helping you process and or most mostly regulate the feelings and and um and i think that makes a lot of sense in terms of thinking about cannabis as well and i've talked to people who who also have a similar sort of experience that like you know things aren't really going well in their relationships you know irl and um a lot of times people sort of look to and find these things that can sort of help replace that but then it's sort of like that friend that sort of seems really attractive at first and tells you really nice things but then kind of talks behind your back and before you realize that you start losing your other friends and you're also like what the heck man like what happened to all these other things so it's like that kind of friend so i mean do you think there is a because a lot of people are wondering so like if i'm hearing you michael like you know i'm not surprised at some of these conclusions because i think they're the similar ones to that what i came to is that you know a lot of people will experience some benefit from using marijuana but really if you look at the studies and stuff what you find is that if we look at some of these ptsd studies in in in the veteran population which you were talking about that there's a correlation between worsening ptsd and in a higher exposure to thc over time i wonder a little bit about that's a chicken or egg thing too is it that people who have worse ptsd are more likely to reach for marijuana or is it that using marijuana sort of numbs yourself and reduces your ability to control your emotions and then can make ptsd worse over time i think you kind of addressed that because you mentioned that if you stop using marijuana and have ptsd that you'll see an improvement of symptoms so there does seem to be more of a causal relationship there suggesting that marijuana is like really not good for ptsd and again we're talking about whole plant higher content of thc products using used frequently and uh chronically for the diagnosis of ptsd yes yeah i mean it's hard to it's hard to make causal relationships with studies where you're not you know testing out yeah cannabis but this is sort of a current understanding of the impact and and so a lot of people are just wondering like is there a healthy way to use marijuana or is it okay if i just use marijuana to help me sleep at night like that's something that i hear a lot what do you think about that yeah i mean certainly possibly there there are healthy ways to use marijuana i'd say that using products that are you know i would caution against sort of again high content thc products with whole plant for people who do have ptsd for people who have psychotic disorders like schizophrenia or have family history of schizophrenia or other psychotic disorders or people who have bipolar disorder as well um also you know i think it's important to talk about some of these harmful effects because into these dispensaries you might not hear about some of these things from those people and if i were to go to a doctor and talk about medication i would want to hear both sides so before i kind of go into the helpful aspects i do want to lay out some of these things and you know there are associations with whole plant cannabis use for people who have asthma that could worsen their symptoms people who have cardiac a cardiac history it could lead to more arrhythmias and things like that i would caution against using it if you're under the age of 25 uh because of its impact on the brain development can you talk a little bit about that yeah sure um again you know this is sort of preliminary data but the the data that we have right now is certainly concerning that you know during the development of the brain which is for uh for men you know up until the age of 25 um but during the development of the brain the the mechanism is not clearly known but cannabis use can dysregulate um the dopamine pathways that help develop the parts of the brain especially in the prefrontal cortex that are required for emotional processing for motivation and for motor functions as well and what we see for example there was a couple studies that were done that took a look in new zealand that gave that attract kids that were using cannabis over time early teenage years to all the way up until their 30s and 40s what they saw was that um in these people they had you know executive function like what i just talked about like deficits but there was also uh for people who used cannabis from an early age and two when they were older there was a slight but there was a significant drop in iq from five to eight points and when they stopped using cannabis later on in life that didn't recover so i think this is sort of the body of evidence that you take a look at and we're like okay we need to maybe be a little bit more hesitant in terms of you know and more mindful in terms of how we're using cannabis especially or again we're back to talking about whole plant cannabis here but when our kid you know and we're talking about potential lasting effects of cannabis for people with the developing brain you know again thinking about like the impact on that and so um there's certainly addiction psychiatrists um my field who are uh pushing for sort of a higher like age limit for for legalization i'm not going to go into much of that rhetoric there but other but all to say is that there's certainly some concern and that's why that's why that's being said yeah so now now people who are listening to this are terrified i think you know people who want to learn about cannabis oftentimes use cannabis and people are now wondering how big is five to eight points like what do we what are we talking about here what does that what does that mean for people practically like you know if you have someone who's so so what is uh and so this is where you know we say kyle we sure let me just jump in with this actually before i give michael a chance to answer but so when we say like if you all have questions you should go see a licensed professional and have an actual conversation i want to talk about that for a second so we don't say that just as a medical disclaimer i think that this is like if i'm hearing one thing from michael that's very loud and clear it's that you can't get a simple answer to these questions so if you say if you ask a question which i get a lot like is it okay to use marijuana to sleep well i think michael's already demonstrated that when there are so many things about that question that warrant individual evaluation or or personalization a personal answer and the first thing that he's kind of emphasized is okay what do you mean by marijuana are you talking about you know like what thc content are you talking about what thc to cbd ratio are you talking about you know like when you say to sleep are we talking about are you using it every day to fall asleep or just certain nights what are the reasons that you're having difficulty sleeping do you have an actual like insomnia is it depression is it poor sleep hygiene like what's going on there and so the biggest concern that i have oftentimes around marijuana usage just in terms of like my clinical work is that a lot of people will say and i think we kind of see this even from some of the studies that he's citing that oh you know i have ptsd like it helps me like with my emotions it helps me with my anxiety if i'm going to a party or something like that we'll see people say things like that whereas you know my perspective as a clinician is like okay i'm not disputing that it helps you in some way but the real question is like what are we signing you up for long term is there some kind of underlying problem here that you're not addressing is it essentially a band-aid that over time can cause problems i've seen some really bad cases of things like cyclic vomiting syndrome which you know i think people who use marijuana thankfully most people don't get that but once you get that it's like very very difficult to deal with um and there are you know really bad outcomes from using band-aids which is basically how i tend to view marijuana is that you know i've seen some clinical benefit generally speaking the best clinical scenarios in which i've seen marijuana use tend to be in cancer patients or in people who have uh really really bad opiate addiction that's refractory to treatment and sometimes you can use marijuana to reduce the opioid dependence and kind of like take the lesser of two evils i've seen that done a couple of times um and that's just because the the risk of being addicted to opiates is just so huge that you kind of like you know need to get people off of it but i i think it's like really important i hopefully all are taking this away as well that like what i'm getting from michael is that it's like subtle and nuanced and individualized and so people will ask questions like is it okay if i do xyz and that's where my answer is like it kind of depends on what's the circumstances you know what's your long-term plan is it like okay like even if you're using marijuana to sleep right now you know is your plan to just continue to use marijuana to sleep for the next 40 years of your life like that doesn't sound like a good plan to me anyway i i kind of jumped in and interrupted you um but yeah no i think that's a great point and coming back to the idea of sleep there is certainly some evidence that again going back to cbd products and high-end milk products that are higher in cbd to thc can potentially sort of decrease the amount of time it takes for you to fall asleep and prolong the amount of sleep you have but what we see in thc products is that it can get in the way of um while it can potentially help somebody fall asleep it does give people like less quality sleep over time by reducing what do you remember the rem is like rapid eye movement part of your sleep and that that's important for a lot of a range of things including like processing contextual processing and um uh like filtering and and processing like emotions that happen during the day um as well as physical benefits as well ranging from the immune system to cardiovascular etc and we see this a lot in medications in general for sleep that yes they can be used short term you're going to use it like talk to your doctor obviously first of all but you know thinking about short term like a few weeks not up not any higher than like three to six months you know try to you could try to use something like that in conjunction with uh working with your doctor but knowing that you know there are sort of long-term side effects to that and focusing on other sort of behavioral uh interventions to sleep which included like sleep hygiene for example um you know reducing the amount of um sort of electronic exposure late at night um yeah i think you had like a total uh you i think you've talked about sleep uh before but um yeah like associating your bed just for sleep insects and nothing or else don't you don't do work and things like that with uh in your bed sort of this uh arousal response mechanism um associating your bed with things that are that help you relax and get to sleep so um so i would say you know i would try to avoid whole plant smoked cannabis for for sleep as of this time there's not really great evidence for it uh for most of those products again you know there's some excitement around sort of this like hired cbd to tc ratio or these like products that have these terpene entourage effects that can mitigate potentially thc levels and reduce the amount of time the high healing but i think the jury is still out on those kinds of products and i mean what i mean by that is like they've tested these on rats so far um in mice and you know i think it needs more evidence in the human sort of clinical setting before we can make conclusions on that and we know anyone who's worked in the biotech space at all knows that things that work in animal models rarely sort of pan out well in human trials so i think i think there's just there's a lot of excitement i i think i'm with like some of that for sure but um in terms of a doctor recommending it for sleep like it's it we're not really at that level yet and i do want to mention right now there's only four fda approved indications for cannabis like at this moment and what are those epidiolex for childhood seizures there's two rare types of childhood sutures with french names i'm not going to try to butcher i believe there's you know appetite stimulation in patients with eating disorders and nausea in patients with chemotherapy and you know i mentioned some of the um synthetic uh forms of cannabinoids that have come out to help treat to help address these things but interesting outside of that so the fda has basically taken a look at all the evidence so far and they basically said there's nothing outside of those four that we have enough evidence to suggest that to say to people like it actually works for these things so that's that's kind of where we're at with a lot of this so michael like so um you know if we say that okay marijuana is like not good to use long term for sleep like what do you think about people who kind of equate or assume that marijuana is going to be the same as like sleeping medications or or you know sleep meds like that both of those are going to be bad they're kind of equally effective or ineffective you don't want to develop a dependence on a sleep medicine as well what do you think about that yeah i think you know we see i i think you mentioned like sort of the band-aid effect and i think that's how a lot of people who are doing the science of the studies matter are really seeing cannabis and cannabis is very different from benzodiazepines in terms of the mechanisms of action but they they both also work on similar neurotransmitters as well and we see this as well with benzodiazepines but that yes it can be helpful for sleep but long term we really try to minimize use over the long term because of those things but you know if you you know if you have uh if you're if you're given like the options of different sleep medications that have been well studied and that have potential use you know if you tried all of those and you want to try cannabis because those are not working i think that's that's sort of the place where i would recommend people well let's try it out and navigate it with their their doctors just because we just have more studies on other things than we do for things like i'll plan thc for for sleep now cbd might be a different story um but kind of similar story in that you know again try other things but you're not gonna die from trying cbd i mean you're not going to die from thc but the harmful effects of cbd don't seem to be as as high as that of thc um both like in the short term and um and you know jury's still out in terms of long term but there's nothing that's come out yet that is completely jarring so and the reason to go for sleep medications that are prescribed if i'm hearing you is that we basically have more science behind them yeah i would say that's the case i mean you mentioned uh other things as well like cannabis for opioid use disorder like if somebody came to me with opioid use disorder you know i would really do them in this justice by saying like hey let's let's try cannabis for this like off the bat because you have life-saving medications like you know we have suboxone buprenorphine you know we have so much evidence for these other life-saving medications for me not to look at these medications that have oh i wasn't talking about opioid use disorder by the way i was talking about pain management pain management yeah sorry oh okay yeah i'm sorry okay i may have actually misspoke but yeah no that's fair but but it's a similar way like i i think typically how doctors like us you know how we see new medications especially ones that are unstudied is that you know um i think we want to be cautiously optimistic about it because we don't want to do harm to our patients and we do want to provide the most like evidence-based medications for somebody's um symptoms so um yeah so so michael what do you think about so we've we've got kind of like two or three different tracks which i think people are really curious about one is um you know the relationship between particular illnesses so for example you mentioned that if you have like a family history of schizophrenia like you should really really stay away from marijuana um can you talk a little bit about that uh so i think that the two kind of divisions that we've got and maybe what we can do is pull chat if we've got a mod but we can ask kind of like about questions around you know what's the relationship between marijuana use and things like schizophrenia or marijuana use and bipolar disorder or the the other route that we can go down is a lot of people have questions about you know can i safely use it um you know is what what about recreational use uh and then other things that people have also talked about which is like you know incorporating i'll see this basically every now and then maybe one at least once a month on the meditation subreddit where people are talking about using marijuana versus not using marijuana while meditating or um we also know that for example some of these more psychedelic compounds that have been used in spiritual traditions for a long time are now being studied for certain things like depression and ptsd um do you have a particular direction that you'd prefer to go or do you think it's important to talk about um i'm happy to to go with whatever the chat wants so whatever okay all those topics are interesting to me i don't think there's a one particular uh um let me see if i can set this okay we've got a poll running so it looks like uh so it looks like um people are curious about safe recreational use the most so what do you think i mean if someone asks can i use weed safely recreationally what do you think about that i think like you said before it's a tough question uh to to address because that really depends on uh what is sort of the wreck what what are we talking about in terms of the recreational use of a uh of a substance and what sort of underlying conditions do people have that could that could corroborate with that now let's say in a perfect world somebody you know you know doesn't have ptsd or bipolar family history or schizophrenia perfect world you know they don't have any history of cardiovascular disease they're above the age of 25 they're not pregnant um and um don't have sort of the pulmonary things that we'd be worried about in terms of smoke cannabis use um can you use it recreationally i would say one that like um as much as you can kind of use it to the point where you're not getting high like that like i think using cbd for example maybe if you're people quite like drinking red wine or something like that like could that be something to using it at night to help sort of relax you maybe at low doses like that it's kind of like chamomile tea if you're going to use cannabis products if you're going to use small canvas products and that's kind of what you've decided recreationally then i would just say try to stick with ones that are lower in thc content like less than 10 or 20 and try not to go above that amount because again the risk that we see with it are sort of in the higher doses than that and try to use it as less frequently as possible and be honest with yourself why are you using it because if a lot of people do say like they're using it recreationally or for pleasure then you know they ask themselves it's probably some symptom that they're addressing and unless like the symptoms are sort of like addressed and talked about um in other ways like that hold on a second michael did i hear you correctly so so you think recreational uses i was kind of confused by some of the dosing you talked about so i'm not really too familiar with marijuana like in terms of people don't you really use it in my social circles and stuff like that but i mean i thought the whole point behind recreational use is that people like to get high like they like to be you know and and so i and isn't that sort of what we're talking about here is like using it to the point of you know high potency kind of thc sort of stuff like when people say recreational use to me i don't think i've never heard of someone who uses recreational marijuana maybe this is uh due to the selection bias and like i mentioned it's not like i i in my social circles they're very popular to use but um you know i've never heard of the marijuana equivalent of drinking one glass of red wine with dinner like it's almost always what i hear about is people you know using for the purpose of of really getting high like they're shooting for that sort of effect recreationally i i don't know it's just strange maybe it's once again the selection bias of who i've hung out with in the past and you know i know who i haven't hung out with but yeah sure um i'd say people have various reasons why they might use cannabis um one could be the sort of the euphoric effect from getting high other people might use it sort of a calming or sort of relaxation kind of like a couch sort of relaxation mode that and some people might not be necessarily chasing the high for it so i would i would consider that there are other ways of using it recreationally okay and there are certainly ways of micro dosing cannabis so that it doesn't get you sort of that euphoric effect um that comes with the high and you know if you're in terms of just re specifically relating to mental health um it's it's really unclear and it's hard for me as a doctor to say like okay go go and get high like every day like it's probably not going to affect like where every other day it's just the data there is just really unclear and so i can't really say like certain what the impact of mental health will be if you're chasing a high and if you're doing that daily but what i can say is that many people do develop over time and effects from that and it's hard for me to tell people that like okay this is safe to do if that makes sense no i i would just say caution if if you're gonna use it to get high like what i i would caution ads with like um i think one you know i guess we talked about one thing that happens but when you're getting high there's sort of this like inhibitory mechanism that happens in your brain um the differential cortex helps like inhibit your thoughts right but like you're chasing the high for creativity or euphoria it's kind of like playing it's like it's kind of like opening loot boxes but like ones that are like completely like kind of a little bit more rigged sometimes against you what i mean by that is like it helps so a lot of people experience the high as like this this idea of like openness and having a lot of interesting insights and thoughts about self-reflection and other thoughts that could be like completely um divergent um meaning like for example like we've we've heard about like artists and ceos like using it for creative reasons in terms of getting high because a lot of it has to do with the divergent form of like creativity meaning like getting all sorts of different ideas out there that are sort of an out of the box style thing but the tough part about it is that um i get that it's fun and it's enjoyable and like to each their own but the tough part about about like being open to all these ideas is that you know you talk about your stream like machines and we've talked about like paranoia and psychosis and all of these things like you're like rolling the dice each like you're kind of gambling a little bit because you don't know like um like you're the openness is is very inclusive and what we're not hearing is like the people who do use it to get high that um ultimately like may potentially give them certain thought machines or ideas about themselves that they start to believe and then maybe later on develop into other things and so um no it's it's i think that whether or not you know getting high will have a significant impact on your health if you're just doing it like once a month or something like that and you don't have those other conditions i've talked about is it gonna have a significant impact on your mental health per se probably not but is that something you're chasing very frequently and that's something that it's it's like a little bit of a gamble each time you're doing it and so we're you hear a lot of positive examples of like people like having creative thoughts on it but then i think as clinicians we see sometimes these negative examples of people who use it recreationally and have a hard time engaging with us in therapy or or being able to make familiar function at work and things like that so it's a tough question uh when in terms of in terms of the high aspect yeah i think a couple of thoughts about that one is that so in my experience like like you mentioned so some people will talk about the benefits of it and and what i tend to find is that there's like if someone successful talks about marijuana use people love it so much that it kind of floats to the top of the internet because everyone who loves marijuana is like see this person did it and they're okay whereas you know what you don't see floating to the top of the internet is you know like the vast majority of you know i mean we see the stuff right in the emergency room when we're on call overnight about whether they be college students or homeless part of the homeless population or just all the people that use marijuana regularly who sort of don't end up in a good place i think another thing that really concerns me is that what i've what i tend to find especially like a little bit in our community is that people will say that they have particular problems which i you know i totally respect they'll say oh you know i struggle with social anxiety or i struggle to find motivation i i can't put together my life and what i oftentimes will find is if i assess them for marijuana use there's like a significantly higher percentage than let's say the average population and so so one of the things that concerns me about marijuana is that it i don't think it's directly responsible but i think it sort of synergizes with a lot of other problems so for example like there's a very high comorbidity between video game addiction and marijuana addiction um and so i even remember looking into the neuroscience of this and was really surprised so one thing that i sort of noticed is that there's a group of people that i worked with that had a lot of trouble like forming new habits so that they were kind of in this bad cycle and like they couldn't get out of that bad cycle and i got kind of curious about that a lot of them would use marijuana very regularly as well and so was really surprised to discover that a lot of the habit circuitry in the brain is actually like governed by cannabinoid receptors so the formation so when you are doing something for the first time and you get that sort of like reward from it that's like if you do something for the first time and you kind of enjoy it or like that behavioral reinforcement in the early stages is actually governed by dopamine and the nucleus accumbens but as we start developing habits we kind of shift from the nucleus accumbens in our dopamine circuitry to cannabinoid circuitry in different parts of the brain and i almost got the impression that when you mess up mess with your dopamine circuitry and cannabinoid circuitry it makes it hard for you to learn from your mistakes and form new habits now there's some neuroscience like basic science kind of support of that when the you know if you look at broadly speaking the receptors involved but i don't think that there's i haven't really seen many studies that go into that degree of sophistication on habit formation and the brains of people who are using substances but it really seems to make sense to me because when those people end up getting sober off of marijuana i tend to find that their motivation and their ability to form healthy habits seems to improve drastically now whether that's a direct effect of like no longer having cannabinoid stimulation in your habit circuitry or it is a consequence of no longer numbing yourself and like getting in touch with your emotions more doing more emotional processing so that you can find your motivation and stuff i don't know but those are the the couple of things that i think about and then the last thing is that you know i get this question a lot where people will ask me like can i use marijuana recreationally and i think you kind of touched on this or mentioned it some but what is recreationally right what are we really talking about and i i've almost you know when i ask more details and this could be a selection bias as well because you know being a psychiatrist i'm going to get a particular kind of person in my office but what i tend to find is that when people talk about recreationally like they're usually referring to multiple times a week like they're not talking about once a month um and and that that's it's just a you know and i'm curious maybe we can do a poll on that too when for those of you that are recreational marijuana users how often are you talking about using it recreationally you know is it more than once a day once a day multiple times a week once a week or like once a month okay so everyone seems to be we'll see if that an actual poll comes up but i mean people are talking i can't tell if they're trolling or not but i mean it seems like the majority of them are saying daily if not multiple times a day but we'll see if there's a poll comes up what do you think about that so yeah are we talking like whole plants inhalable cannabis use daily or multiple times a day can you be doing that in a way that is is healthy okay so so it looks like so here's the poll results okay so how often do you use recreational marijuana 50 of people say more than once a day um sixteen percent of people say once a day sixteen percent of people say once a week uh five percent of people say once a month and sixteen percent of people say less than once a month so i'd say that you know the numbers are changing a little bit but 60 of people who talk about recreational marijuana use are referring to it at least once a day and it looks like about 40 percent of people are once a week or less which has been my experience so i'd say two-thirds of people are like using it once a day or you know a few times a week yeah i think one thing we talked about is like not everyone who does use it every day develops an addiction to that so in terms of thinking about like is it going to be problematic from that perspective that you have people have to just kind of know their own limitations and know what's going on there and and certainly you know that could be done potentially from an addiction perspective now uh will how would that impact your brain in the long term how will that impact your mental health the long term i mean it's really hard not to think about sort of what we have with our association studies with like daily use and a lot the studies have usually used like two or three times a day or like three times a day or more as like sort of a heavier use of cannabis it's hard not to think that there's going to be some risk involved with motivation some risks involved with just like executive function or thinking some risks involved with um being like emotional processing when you're using it that much you know those risks and you feel you feel like risks don't outweigh the benefits like who am i to say like that this is not something that that you should be doing but um it's i think that there are certainly just risks that you have to be aware of you know as you're doing that and i think another thing that's worth mentioning is that we are really bad human beings are really bad at assessing our own cognition like we have parts of our brain that can assess maybe how sleepy we are we have parts of our brain that can maybe assess like what our emotions are you know when we're in a good place but there's when when our frontal cortex which is processing things is like failing there's no part of your brain that's saying like okay your executive functions at sixty percent of normal now there's we are really bad at it i mean like you look no further than like people who are like you know challenging like professional smash players if you're a complete noob and because you think that you're amazing you know because your friends are amazing like like because because you're amazing amongst your friends like um you know we we're just not good at assessing our own abilities and cognition or like if we're like playing video games since like the eighth or ninth hour we're like okay let's do one more game i'm fine dude like i'm totally fine i'm with it like we we're not great at doing this and we see this also in driving studies and sleep studies as well that we're just not great at assessing it and so what do we what should we look at as a marker for like how we're doing cognitively when we're on these things uh my opinion is that you know just as with gaming we have to look at like the people around us and what they think about how our use is is affecting our cognition and come up with objective markers either through getting a diary and like doing you know putting out your own feelings during the day writing out like your thoughts and how you're doing functionally and things like that and we also see you know there's a study um i think in 2017 where they looked at people who were using cannabis for creativity and what it showed is that the people who used this felt like they had more divergent meaning like more different ideas in terms of creativity especially among uh creative arts but when they assessed like during that time like if they actually just looked back and assess like what products of art they made and whether or not they would consider that to be a productive or creative art in retrospect there was no difference with with like placebo like essentially essentially what the study suggested was that that like when we're when when we use cannabis you know we feel more creative we feel this euphoria it's a good feeling but whether or not like we're actually producing something creative whether or not we're actually doing something productive with the time like and i've talked to people who are like yeah like i felt really good but then writing a song or like doing something with it but then when i got out of that trip and i looked back i was like okay wait this is just kind of garbage like you know so i think we just have to just you know all i can talk about are the risks like every person is different and you know if you weighed all this risk and for yourself the benefit's still our way like who am i to say well i mean i i yeah i mean i think that's that's i i get what you're saying in terms of you know the most we can do here is sort of share the risks but i think that's kind of important to understand like what you just said i want to kind of like focus on that for a second so i think the challenge with a lot of substances is that we just have poor awareness right of what the substance first of all like if we're really using it recreationally or not i mean when i think about so 40 43 of chat was saying that they use it more than once a day when they think about recreational use so that's like a staggering number right that's like higher than what i was expecting but um and so we're sort of poor judges you mentioned i think the cognition studies are important because i i have found that when i work with people who are using substances and are especially like don't really think that they have a problem or maybe you know they're kind of like in the pre-contemplative stage of stages of change but they sort of don't really like they think it's recreational and they sort of what i oftentimes find is that there's very poor awareness of like what's actually going on with its use and if you sit down and really tunnel down into okay like what allows you like what makes it recreational there's a lot of things that you're using it for like even if it's that okay yeah i use it because i want to have fun but like i can't have fun because i'm so worried about my future and the only way that i can like enjoy myself on a day is like in and have recreation is to get rid of the existential dread of everything that's going wrong in the world and in my life and then like you know i do that through marijuana i agree completely it's a tricky business too because when you that's in people who you know once you i think you talked about sort of pathway of like chronic heavy use in terms of the dependency you know initially there's sort of a positive dopamine spike to it there's sort of a pleasure feeling to it but over time you know these dopamine receptors like they become down regulated and yadda yadda i'm just gonna say that end result is that you know our the dopamine response that we have to things outside of the substance becomes way lower our our ability to derive pleasure outside of whatever it is that substance that we might be dependent on is lower and you know people sort of describe this hypodopaminergic depression that can happen so what that means is that once you get that stage yeah so once you get to that stage where sort of you're not deriving measure from other things because a dopamine response to things outside the substance is just mitigated because of the neurobiology that goes on we start feeling depressed and the only thing that can get us to sort of even a baseline level of feeling is that substance itself see this with opioids we see this cannabis so so the tricky part is that when you're at that stage um picking cannabis or taking other things like it feels like it's improving your depression because without it you feel really depressed nothing gives you pleasure cannabis the tricky part too that i found in terms of especially like helping people to understand how cannabis might be affecting their mind is that when they stop taking it there's this withdrawal effect too if you if if if dependence and and and the use disorders is at play here there's this withdrawal effect makes people feel depressed and anxious so what happens is it's like people come to me and tell me like hey i've been trying to come off of this but i'm actually way depressed and way more anxious off of it than i'm on to it so i'm going to come back on to it but you know part of part of the discussion of like you know if somebody does have a dependence or addiction is is is talking through that there is a withdrawal phase where you will feel much worse and that doesn't mean that like the cannabis has been treating you the whole time and has been doing a good job of that it could very well mean that you're withdrawing from it and part of our job here together is to to kind of slowly come off of it in a way that's safe and that in a way that can help mitigate some of those effects as well in your experience michael how long does it take to recover from that hypodopaminergic depression that you're talking about like how long does it because what we're talking about here is neurobiological tolerance right so so it's almost like caffeine where like if i never drink caffeine and i drink a cup of coffee it'll keep me up all night but if i drink coffee every day and i wake up i'm barely functional without caffeine whereas if i detox off of caffeine i'll be perfectly functional in the morning so we're talking you're referring this hypo dopaminergic depression you're talking about tolerance right yeah i guess caffeine is kind of a microcosm of it but yeah yeah oh sure so so you know what so like there's some people who were you know terrifying with our discussion people who have been using marijuana since their teenage years and are afraid that they've burned their iq points and are very hopeless because they're used every day and you know when they stop using they experience a lot of these like negative emotions like anxiety or depression wha what are we what are they kind of in for ballpark in terms of like if i stop let's say i'm a daily user of marijuana just kind of gut check and i recognize this is probably highly individual as well but you know what am i in for like how long before i start equilibriating and can sort of get rid of that hypodopaminergic depression in terms of hypodopatic depression because we're talking about regulation at the receptor level this can oftentimes take months even up to a year like it's it's a tough process and i think that's why you know coming off of sort of a high level of heavy cannabis use safely and or not safely like in a way that's sort of more comfortable it does take time and it and typically like a tapering effect can be helpful like coming down by like enter 20 like every month or two something like that a gradual taper with you know there's medications out there as well that can help mitigate these withdrawal symptoms too and that can help make it a little bit more tolerable um obviously doing this with somebody who who's experienced um you know the counseling of therapy is going to be important things like that but you know a lot of these if if there are symptoms of like lack of motivation executive function um emotional processing a lot of these symptoms especially like people who started using you know in their adult years can be reversible like once you come off of it um so there's def there is hope and you know my hope is that you know that in terms of the field of medicine that we can be better at um being able to manage these these aspects because you know frankly speaking you know many providers out there you know they did they did like a survey study like a few years ago within like the last few five years and like only half the primary care doctors were comfortable really talking about cannabis with their patients so in terms of thinking about like how can we be able to engage with people in an informed way help them to think about the risks and benefits properly with their cannabis use i mean obviously we have a lot of research to do to be able to do that but a lot of it also has to be like we we need to be more informed and and more helpful to people in terms of navigating these spaces than we have been and i think that's um i think that's the frustration point as a provider but totally a frustration point for people as well who are just wanting to use these substances or wanting to use them for helpful things but finding that either access to them or getting information from them is really difficult so let's let's turn to a couple of these other things that you mentioned so you you mentioned that uh you know having a family history of of schizophrenia as like basically a contraindication is the medical term we use so you know if you've had a history of schizophrenia either yourself or in your family members you should steer clear of weed what's the relationship between uh illnesses like schizophrenia and marijuana use sure so i think there's a couple sort of links that we uh understand here and again like the evidence is still the body of evidence is still growing but you know one thing that is really kind of signaled out in the studies are that people who have a family history of schizophrenia or have a genetic predisposition to schizophrenia based on a dose-dependent manner meaning the higher thc content of cannabis you use and the more frequently you use that and develop sort of are more likely to express their underlying genetic sort of predisposition to and express schizophrenia earlier in their life and are more likely to express it like four to six times higher likelihood than if they didn't use cannabis at all so that's why we try to question against using for people who have uh psychotic disorders but psychosis is we talk about long-term psychosis but then in terms of short-term uh we also caution people who have schizophrenia you know from using hc containing whole cannabis products especially of high thc content again because it can increase the the um the likelihood of them expressing um psychotic symptoms i have a patient i've been you know treating with for like a few years now and every time this person decompensates because they're using cannabis and it leads to sort of more sort of uh hallucinations and voices and things like that i think one thing we haven't mentioned that's important to mention as well is that cannabis can interact medications as well that's sort of an important point to be talking to your doctor about and i'll give you an example of this that like you use a smoked product like cannabis can basically operate on an enzyme in your liver that can that can change the doses of certain medications that you're taking so for example in patients schizophrenia coming back to this example this person was on zyprexa or lanzipine which is an antipsychotic and using cannabis and higher doses of it can actually reduce the amount of the antipsychotic that you're getting in your system so another reason why you know we caution people from using cannabis especially on certain medications is that it can it not only can contribute to these episodes but it can also limit the amount your medications are actually helping you so it's kind of a double whammy there um in a difficult way so that's kind of why we we sort of see it that way for schizophrenia um another psychiatrist and let me just make sure i got this so it sounds like if you have a family history of schizophrenia and you use you know as you mentioned whole what did you call it whole plant yeah whole plant forms of cannabis that have hot or high thc contents it increases so if we just think about this for a second just because you have a family a history of schizophrenia does not mean like if your parents or one of them had schizophrenia let's say it doesn't mean that you're gonna grow up and and have schizophrenia but what we do know is that there's a genetic component that increases your risk of having schizophrenia then the problem is that studies show that essentially if you let's say i have one let's say i have a parent with schizophrenia so i have a certain risk of getting it myself and i'm not sure exactly what that is i imagine it's less than 50 percent it's probably what like 20 30 uh i i i think it's it's still you know significantly less than 50 percent of memory serves um and then the challenge though is imagine you have two kids in that family and they both are let's say born with a 20 risk of developing schizophrenia and one of them uses a heavy amount of marijuana during their developmental years what you mentioned is a four to six-fold increase in risk right so and increasing risk of developing in their lifetime and increased risk of them developing expressing it early on in their lifetime is also something so so the other interesting thing there when he when i think when michael's talking about expressing it early on so there's also data that shows that the earlier you get affected by schizophrenia generally speaking the worst that you do so like people who get schizophrenia at an early age and for example don't finish college um and aren't able to enter the workforce in like a substantial way like those people tend to have worse outcomes in life like they're not as financially independent their symptoms can get worse and things like that too so part of what we also see with people who use marijuana is that they'll get an earlier um they'll get earlier they'll sort of get schizophrenia earlier which then sort of impacts their life kind of more profoundly it's almost like you know it has like a snowballing effect is is kind of the takeaway that i had from the people that i've worked with and so really using it early is like can have a profound negative impact on the trajectory of your life even though it feels like at the age of 14 or 15 if you take a week or a month that you're using versus not using it may not feel like that big of a deal but if it increases your risk and you manifest schizophrenia earlier and you're unable to finish school and things like that that kind of stuff like snowballs and then like you're 20 years old like you're not in college and then you kind of feel behind and you have difficulty like socializing with other people and that stuff then then you kind of get like more depressed and i've seen these cases unfortunately a fair amount where people just really struggle and the the better cases i've seen definitely happen to people who are you know get schizophrenia a little bit later in life and have more stability around them have more sort of social supports and things like that around them and they tend to do a lot better yeah certainly the earlier you start using it sort of the greater especially starting during childhood um and what about things like bipolar disorder like what's your what's your take on marijuana usage and depression or other kinds of mood disorders i mean there's um starting with depression uh there's not really good evidence that whole plant cannabis use is helpful for depression i think we talked about this hypodopaminergic depression that we see i mean people who do use it sort of chronically and long term um some small evidence uh i think we talked about well there's some uh trials especially short-term use of cbd for ptsd the same thing with uh depression that um you know cbd uh operates on like the cb2 receptor but it also operates on a serotonin receptor called the 5ht1 which um you know can be implicated in depression can be implicated in anxiety uh cognitive flexibility as well or sort of our ability to change the way we perceive or think about things and that's sort of how we think that ketamine might work as well so working on sort of a receptor that could potentially have therapeutic benefits for i'm sorry can you say that the 5ht 1 receptor you said is affected by cbd yes interesting does it have is there some suggestion that there's a therapeutic benefit there or it like messes with the receptor in a negative way or do we not know no we there's there's certainly a signal that there could be a therapeutic benefit i think the most again you know these are sort of sort of limited evidence open label meaning not controlled trials people know what they're taking so there is that placebo risk but um you know social anxiety cbd for social anxiety is one area of like a lot of interest and i think there is um evidence that that could be used potentially for ptsd symptoms as well especially nightmares flashbacks things like that i've had patients who have used cbd and that's been helpful and depression somewhat insomnia is sort of there's some evidence for that as well but it's sort of not as fleshed out as some of these anxiety disorders are but there's definitely some excitement around that and i think some of that is is founded um you know there's some evidence for you know in autism and sort of aggression irritability um maybe adhd i mean we have like a smorgasbord of different things um but um i think the especially social anxiety and ptsd um that's sort of where we seen garnered some some interesting like positive evidence for so um so so michael i notice i i mean maybe you can explain this you'll say there's some evidence for or there's excitement can you help us understand like what that means does that mean that there's some evidence for cbd's benefit on the 5ht one serotonin receptor therefore i can smoke weed as long as it's got cbt in it like what is it when you say some evidence for or excitement what do those terms mean help us understand okay so i'm meaning like uh concentrated so forms of cbd in like uh like epidiolex for example which is a cbd version of it is basically cbd that's um sort of a prescribed uh pharmaceutical and looking at use in in in conditions like social anxiety and ptsd we've seen in short term like we're talking about eight week trials like people who take somewhere in the range of like 200 to 400 milligrams ish and we're still trying to figure out where this dose range is like the the and we as in like the medical community that um you know there there is some evidence that that that um people who do use a cbd over a period of time can and you know develop improvements in in these symptoms and not have sort of the um sort of the psycho act there so cbd itself sort of doesn't have the kind of psychoactive effect um that thc has um psychoactive as in like sort of the psychotic producing effects or the anxiety producing effects that thc have and sort of our understanding right now is that it doesn't have sort of the addictive potential not nearly as much as we see in thc and cbd can even you know there's some evidence that shows that it could even sort of start reversing some of these aspects when combined with thc so i think that's where you know there is some excitement meaning like excitement as in in the media or in sort of even like very early trials and animal models that like if you combine cbd thc and other elements as well you might be able to come up with a personalized a product that may be able to alleviate certain symptoms you have without giving you that high that could then produce you know that may have other problematic effects and um that might you know help you with that condition but it's still very early on in terms of evidence yeah in the sense that like it's too early for people to like start recommending it yeah dude so so just to kind of like add some context around that so you know if we think about a clinical trial or we think about how science is conducted you can have so michael mentioned an open label kind of trial so so we think about the gold standard of scientific evidence as the randomized controlled trial which i personally don't think is a gold standard but that's a conversation for a different day but um so the whole point is that you know you have two groups they're randomized so there's no selection bias into who gets put into one group versus another group we have controls in place so like we're controlling for things like age and gender and other kinds of things so there are ways that we can conduct science that give us a strong amount of confidence that we can make a recommendation and and right now what i'm getting from michael is that the trials on cbd and stuff haven't reached that level of scientific vigor so what we sort of have is we may have we'll take uh we'll do a survey of let's say 30 people who use cbd and we'll ask them how much does it help your anxiety and those 30 people will say it seems to help a lot and so then what we'll do is is scientists will say okay so there's like some kind of signal here but we have no idea we haven't controlled for biases we haven't controlled for doses we haven't controlled like we don't really know what they're using or how often they're using so we haven't controlled for all this stuff so like even though there's there's kind of like a bright point on the horizon that hey maybe there's something here of value we haven't conducted enough rigorous scientific trials to sort of really determine okay this is a good idea or this is safe and and i what i'm getting from and even if we look at like a lot of the research on psychedelics and stuff like that's kind of where things are now although psychedelics in some cases are a little bit further along but you know it's like it's sort of like we'll do an initial study with a small number of people without adequate controls and we'll sort of figure out okay is there something here worth looking into a little bit further and then we'll do a bigger trial with more people and more controls and then we'll try to duplicate that trial and then we'll do a bigger trial and then we'll really start to do like dose kind of trials where okay what about 200 versus 100 or 200 versus 400 or 200 versus five and then so what's the right dose that you need to get this kind of like benefit that we're talking about in terms of 5ht one kind of activity that makes like reduces anxiety and so this is really for for us to have scientific confidence that hey as a medical doctor we can or is the medical profession we can say that this works or doesn't work i think this is where like there's a lot of confusion i think in in the lay public about like you know the levels of evidence that we really have to get to and that you can have a trial that's very promising early on but and even michael mentioned like animal models so people will do things with rats and they'll they'll you know assess depression and rats and they'll give them cbd at megadoses because the other thing about rat trials if you ever look at the dosing is it's absurd they'll give rats you know a hundred times the dose per weight that you would give a human and then they'll sort of see some kind of like promising effect um and anyway so i just wanted to kind of like make sure that people understood the context around you know promising and excitement and and that looks like there's some possibility and for people to really understand that you know when michael says something like that i i as much as people we got just got to be a little bit careful about like to what extent people are interpreting that as oh this is safe to do or this is a good idea because i don't think we're really there yet absolutely i agree that completely um and so so you we've talked a little bit about mood psychotic disorders anything else that you kind of want to talk about today we've been at this for about almost two hours now um trying to think yeah i think one thing to mention just along the lines of just cbd is that you know as much as i think uh people are feeling sort of the frustration that there's like a lot of these uh ideas and products out there and you know as doctors we're not kind of ready to start prescribing using them at the same time you know i'm feeling that as well in the sense that like even if the evidence were to be there we're still kind of far from being able to prescribe something like a dialect or something like anxiety or social anxiety epidiolex is again the only thing that we could get on formulary here in the hospital but even now like insurance would not cover the dialects which is cbd again you know they wouldn't cover like at this time uh that for like indications in sort of the mental health realm so and and the cost is like tens of thousands of dollars we're talking like very expensive so i think i think some of the frustration is that like you know even obtaining the cbd for trials or even trying to use it in clinical practice in with patients that maybe you know are not responding well to other medications or wanted to use it in addition to those medications is very difficult right now i think that's kind of why like we have we as kind of doctors have to really yeah at this time like really help our patients to navigate this field in a way that's so some people are also kind of talking a little bit about here we are as two doctors talking about this stuff um how do you think so how i'm trying to figure out how to phrase this question so you know there's an argument to be made that since we don't use marijuana we don't really understand the benefits and we don't really understand what we're talking about how would you what do you think about that right so here we are like we're sort of like in our ivory towers in academia sort of talking about these studies and stuff like that how do we weigh you know what we have to say against someone who's actually like used marijuana and is familiar with it and can speak much more personally to the benefits of creativity and you know how it sort of helped them in so many different ways and help them make friends and stuff like that because that is the experience that some people will describe right absolutely and i think what we i think as doctors we sort of and to talk in terms of like probability and in terms of studies and we kind of like public health sort of promoting people and that's sort of a bias because we want to look at populations and we want to have populations grow sort of in a healthy way that there is bias in that in acknowledging that there are people who might be using these things safely and not really like impacting sort of their mental health or other things in ways that were are coming out of these trials but sort of um are using it in those ways but you know we you know obviously without our personal experience in its in that in that sort of way and um in our bias there like we're that's something that we we don't have sort of insight into um i think we we have like a high bar for like evidence and trials and things like that before we use things we're very sort of adverse effective sort of people as a field it takes a while for us to be convinced that something works and that something helps and i mean part of that reason is that we would hate for us as doctors to like recommend something and then all of a sudden we find out later how bad it is and we've seen that being the case for opioids for example and i'm not saying cannabis is like opioids but i'm all i'm saying is that like we have a pretty high bar for being able to say like okay this is something that's safe to do this is something that you should be doing among all these conditions and i think that i think there's certainly a bias for that as well and but you know i think i think it's helpful to listen to different sources and conversations about it and we might be able to speak to the harmful effects a little bit better and other people might be able to be able to speak to the per their personal experiences better way better than us and you know i think it would be completely this is why i talked about bias in the beginning because it would be completely sort of untruthful to say that you know that we are able to provide a full picture of the experience of cannabis and an unbiased source if anyone tells you they're unbiased they are lying to you because it's either it's going to there's going to be bias to every sort of every experience so i hope this is sort of just a part of people's experiences they engage with so i i i think you i liked a couple of the things that you mentioned michael like so the first is that as medical professionals we tend to be more sensitive to the adverse effects than the benefits right so our profession is one where you know if something helps people 75 percent of the time but hurts people 25 of the time that is a terrible medical treatment so if we just look at like the rates of like adverse events we ten you know that's not something that we would i think almost ever use right the only examples that i can think of of you know things that have that kind of therapeutic index or like chemotherapy and stuff like that where it's like dire dire situations but generally speaking you know i i think that's that's a big piece i think another big piece is uh so we tend to be more risk averse as physicians than i think some sometimes people use marijuana are go ahead yeah so we tend to be like very like medicine has a bias of being like very risk-averse right if you think about like you go to your doctor and they give you a treatment and has an 80 chance of working and a 20 chance of causing harm like no one would ever go to that doctor as as a field we tend to be we have a bias towards being risk averse so we would rather do something that is effective like 95 percent of the time and even like less effective i would take half efficacy at a 95 success rate over like you know 95 efficacy 50 of the time and then like of a high chance of like causing damage like we just that's a good inherent bias i think the other thing to remember is that a lot of people who are you know proponents of marijuana use i don't know exactly what their sample size is and this is where in medicine we also have a bias towards public health right so i i've worked with people that have had very very positive experiences with marijuana that they say you know hasn't negatively affected them at all that's great but what i'm really concerned about this is also true i mean so i've done a lot of this in terms of alternative medicine as well where there's a ton of alternative medicine which i've found to be very very efficacious and shockingly so which i almost never talk about because it has low reliability so it may be transformative for one person's life but like half of the people who try it get no benefit or it even can hurt them and so i think the the other big bias that we have in in medicine is that we tend to be like so we're gonna undervalue an individual's experience compared to what the average expected experience is going to be so we make decisions probabilistically like i remember when i was in residency you know i learned a very important lesson which is that someone could ask me a question if i have major depressive disorder and you start me on this medication or if if there's a patient that has major depressive disorder and you start them on an antidepressant medication what is what amount of benefit can you expect i can answer that question but if someone walks into my office and says i have major depressive disorder if you start me on this medication what what benefit do you do you think i'll get and that's like actually a lot harder of a question because we can answer questions about populations at whole because that's what clinical trials look at they look at 10 000 people and what's the average effect size but what happens in that 10 000 person trial is that you know 3 000 of those people get way better 3 000 of those people get like a little bit better and 3 000 of those people don't really get better at all and then we average all those numbers together and we get sort of this like this effect size which we then expect but once you start practicing clinically what you begin to realize is that even though you can expect an average effect size there's actually like a high degree of variance between individual people and their experience their responses to something like marijuana um yeah thoughts yeah absolutely um and i think for any like and i think you know applying that bias then to sort of whole plant cannabis you know if we see something like you said that could have potential adverse effects our bar for being convinced that the benefits are going to outweigh that risk is going to be much higher okay our bar for whole plant cannabis to like like saying that it could be safe and helpful for people with mental health is going to be a lot higher if we see that there are also a lot of people who may be having these adverse effects and you know with cbd our bar i mean our bar for like sort of helping someone navigate through that is going to be slightly lower than with whole plant cannabis because we know that the side effects mostly are like gastrointestinal when we get to the hundreds of milligrams or like liver toxicity and things like that but we kind of know how to manage that a little bit and there's a little bit you know we we've seen clinical trials of cbd and epidiolex for seizure disorders we kind of know like short term maybe a little bit like longer term what it's going to do and there's some certainty around that whole plant again has so many chemicals beyond thc and cbd we just don't know yet given the uncertainty and given the potential adverse effects you know as clinicians it's like our bar just goes that much higher in terms of like thinking about it and whether or not it's going to be safe or effective so michael have you talked about delta 8 thc have we talked about that because a lot of people are curious about delta 8 thc yeah i mean i i don't know too much about that to be very honest and you know we as a field you know it's something that's hard to sort of purify out of the plant itself because there's very low amounts of it compared to delta nine so it's not that's not something i would be comfortable sort of talking about in a second like i don't i don't know of the good evidence for against it so i'll sort of leave out myself out of that conversation yeah i mean i think that's fair right so so and i think one thing to remember uh as as michael mentioned is that i remember seeing this study there was a a paper i think by rich saper i don't know if you ran across him but i think he's at brigham or bi but who is looking at like the amount of like what's in herbal formulation so if you like go to the store and you like buy a bottle of you know turmeric or something like that what they actually found is very similar to what you were describing which is i think nine out of 16 brands that they randomly sampled had little to know of the compound that was advertised if you actually like check it by i think uh gas spectrometry or something like that i forget or chromatography i forget what they used but um and you know 7 out of 16 had some of it but oftentimes like three or four of those had like lower amounts than what they claimed was in it so i think the other thing to just be super careful about and and this is why you know i think some people are also concerned about us being like anti-marijuana and i think that's where like you've got to be careful i i don't know that we're anti-marijuana but at some point like you can look at the evidence and you can sort of form a conclusion and so we've i think michael's done a good job of sort of sharing what our biases are right so we tend to be risk averse we tend to be population focused so any individual person may say oh but marijuana works fantastic for me i think the problem is that when you follow what that person says what is the likelihood that your experience is going to mirror that individual person's experience i think that's where and you can make an argument against this but i think that like you know the experience of your experience isn't going to match perfectly the average of 10 000 people's experiences but i think over time if you base your decisions on the average you're more likely to do well over time right so we're gonna have that kind of bias and you just have to be super careful with things like delta eight thc because i have no idea who's regulating that right what are you actually getting and the other problem that we see a lot with this stuff like you know fentanyl overdoses and things like that is not only is fentanyl more potent but like there's no like i don't know how to say this but when you get stuff from a drug dealer there's no guarantee of quality right there's you just don't have that so so that's where the risk is so much higher for delta 8 thc maybe what you're just getting is is you know some inert substance that because of your placebo effect and because of the echo chamber of your social circle you think has this awesome effect but there's just no way of like controlling that information and so that's why you know i think that generally speaking i'm very hesitant about marijuana use i'm very hesitant about recommending it um on balance i'd say like don't do drugs kids and there's a reason why we say that right and the good news is that thankfully i think science is sort of progressing to where we're we're open-minded about stuff so we are studying these things like psilocybin we are studying these things like mdma and their therapeutic effects um we are studying marijuana and its therapeutic effects some i mean it's hard to do that research i think as as michael mentioned but in the meantime like it's just i i've just seen so many people get screwed so hard by marijuana that like i can't recommend that anyone uses it outside of these specific as michael's mentioned you know fda approved kind of situations because those are the situations in which on balance like the the risks far out i mean the benefits far outweigh the risks and uh yeah with you uh there and you know there are companies out there uh that tried to um like test like using sort of lab results like the different contents of like cbd sort of going off of what you were saying earlier um you know i'm not going to promote sort of any resources per se but like consumer lab is something that it is unfortunately like a paid subscription but something that that i've used to to navigate like what um how much content of cbd or thc are in certain products and they they try to do a good job and i can't say like how accurate they are with it but i um all to say is like as a consumer like definitely be as informed as you can about these products and don't take for face value like um sort of what you're told about even here in this room and um and you know there's always going to be biases i mean the opposite end of things as well like we see we we recommend let's say like people with depression antidepressants but there's going to be small proportion of people you know even though we see that antidepressants are effective for many just have a negative effect from it or don't have any effect at all and sort of from their experience they may feel like you know it's something that's not helpful at all or even have a negative expense uh negative factors you know develop suicidal thoughts later on and you know can have their own experiences of it that you know we don't capture and we you know i think there's certain biases there as well and it's totally fair to say that like you know their experiences are completely valid um and um you know and sort of their you know people's understanding of the field of psychiatry or even cannabis in general and everyone sort of is approved sort of to their own perspectives and views and and should go to different sources to get information ones that are more valid than others so well thanks a lot michael um do you want to or do you want to share a little bit about if you want to where people can kind of find you in terms of socials and stuff like that or you want to just steer clear of that um i mean i do have a twitter it's something that i you know haven't been using that often but it's something that if people want to engage in more conversation about i'm totally up for it um it's you know i've mostly been using that to share papers and journals and things like that and to connect with people in the field but it's at michael hsumd on twitter so happy to do that and um yeah yeah thank you so much for coming on and and sharing you know your your experience and expertise on cannabis um and yeah we really appreciate it man take care yeah yeah thanks for having me alex yeah yeah so um yeah i mean what did you what did y'all think about that like i think we talked a little bit about schizophrenia right yeah so you know just to kind of like so i've been following chat and some people are saying wow chad is so so toxic so let's let's like go reach to some of our hg roots for a second and talk a little bit about okay so if you're watching something like this and you feel combative or you feel upset or you feel attacked right so what i've what i tend to find is that when people talk about subjects that are charged for some people the most important thing for you to do is to like understand why is what they're saying bothering me like i've seen these different kinds of you know comments about like you know anyway just people will say oh there's successful people who use weed and stuff like that so like just think about that for a second like forget about the statement and whether it's true or not and that's kind of i think what michael and i's point was we're not saying that there aren't successful people who use weed that's not what our job is as medical professionals i mean even here i'm not really acting as a medical professional but when i'm you know when we think about when i'm sitting with a patient the reason that i can't recommend it is not like we don't recommend things based on the fact that there are successful people who have done it so for example i've also met successful people who have been divorced twice and are on their third marriage and are happily married and at the same time just because there are people who are who have been married three times and are happy in their third marriage does not mean that i can recommend marrying someone who's been divorced twice in search of a happy marriage does that make sense like there are going to be cases of that right but they're still like you can play the odds and and that's where i think like in my opinion you know marijuana's kind of problematic there because if you look at the odds we tend to be it tends to not look great so that doesn't mean that it doesn't have a place somewhere it's just based on the odds it's not great the the next thing that and kind of going back to what i'm saying is like if you feel like arguing with us or you feel like this is big pharma or whatever whatever whatever you all want to do it's fine you can have those opinions but what i would really focus on if you really want to like understand yourself better which is ultimately what we're we're just going to disseminate the information based on our experience and expertise and you can dispute that if you want to that's totally fine neither of us ever claim by the way that we're you know know everything about marijuana it's just we're sharing what we've learned but if you get super charged or triggered by what we're saying like i would start by exploring where that comes from right so if if you because i think like michael was fantastic he's like at the very beginning he's like everyone's got biases we've got biases and we've done our best to even share what those biases are but if you kind of default to like oh big pharma like i mean i've seen comments that you know sleeping medication and marijuana is no different like that i disagree with right because like and that's where like i i do think there's a big difference because one of them has been rigorously studied and the other has not one of them when you get a prescription for a sleep medication the dose that you're getting is is basically speaking guaranteed whereas when you buy marijuana i mean one of the big things that michael emphasized is that even the studies that we have on marijuana are from like the days when the thc concentration was two to three percent now it's like 20 to 30 percent so like how does that affect what we can expect in terms of therapeutic value we have no idea so i think there's a lot of stuff that's different about medication versus marijuana and y'all can say oh my god i'm i'm a shill for pharma which is fine but i i mean we don't really we're not here recommending particular medications on stream right like we may at some point who knows but generally speaking like that's not something that we do and so this is where you know if you're reacting strongly to this i and even if you're reacting strongly in like a positive way like i would explore where that reaction is coming from so if you watch this stream and then the next thing that you're gonna do is go to your friend brother sister significant other kid and say hey watch the stream see i've told you that marijuana is bad and now these two people on twitch are saying that marijuana is bad see see i told you so check yourself there because what are you reacting to so we're just sharing information and if you're reacting strongly to this in either direction like start by understanding what that reaction is like why do i feel so strongly about the subject and sometimes it's you know it comes down to like what was like recreation use like we mentioned there's a question about oh like what do you think about recreational use and and like you know michael was like oh i guess if you like use it once a month like i can see how and then we ask chat but like no one who's talking about recreational very few people or not very few we have the statistics right so based on a poll of twitch chat 40 43 of people who are talking about recreational use are talking about more than once a day another 16 to 70 are talking about once a day so we're sitting at like 60 percent of people are talking about daily use which when they're talking about recreational which is very different from the answer that michael gave in terms of his assumptions about what recreational use was that was my experience as well which is like generally speaking it's like the number's high right and and like 16 or 17 was like less than once a month now this wasn't a scientific study it's not a random sampling who knows who's trolling in this kind of thing but this is my point is that like there's this is such a nuanced and individual topic that i think first of all y'all should be as informed as you can be secondly be critical of it right so everyone keeps on mentioning snoop dogg which is like sure like you know i would love to talk to snoop dogg about his experiences of marijuana right because he may have a different perspective to share and and that's where it's like you know that's the whole point is like what we try to do here share perspectives even when we talk about things like ayurveda or even like clinical explanations of psychiatry or meditation what we're doing is sharing perspective we've never claimed to be the arbiters of truth what we've done is a fair amount of research we have a fair amount of experience and it's our job to try to share that with y'all and for you all to think critically about what we say and decide what works for you and what doesn't and especially when it comes to marijuana usage highly highly recommend for all of the reasons that we've said when we say go see a doctor about this stuff the reason for that is not like just go see a doctor it's like to understand that you know if you are using it to having trouble difficulty sleeping there could be all kinds of reasons that you're having difficulty sleeping why not address the the root of the insomnia maybe you've got sleep apnea like who who knows if you've got social anxiety maybe you're hyperthyroid did you all know that feeling anxious like part of the differential diagnosis for that is getting is a high level of thyroid hormone this is why we recommend medical treatment and sort of individualized personalized decisions especially when it comes to things like marijuana because i don't think there is a one-size-fits-all answer because even if we say on average we wouldn't recommend it there are people out there who are saying but there are successful people who are on weed i use it recreationally it doesn't really bother me things like that so on and so forth which is fine we're not disputing that at all it's just if you're trying to make a decision how do you know what the odds are right because you have no idea like if someone else uses like you know snoop dogg uses marijuana or so i have heard and the very successful very creative you know if he says it's a huge part of his success like that's fine like the question is though if i were to take you know a thousand people who make music and use marijuana like where are they in terms of their success right so i've heard i've never seen him do it i've never seen a drug test right i don't know and and that's the real challenge with this stuff because what happens is once your mind likes a substance then what it does is elicit its own cognitive biases so i don't like so this is like we're going to talk for a second about the addict's mind so the addict's mind once it likes something it will find whatever information it can to like support what it wants to do and will vigorously attack anything that disagrees with it and if you guys have had someone who's like in denial before you'll sort of see that right and so how do we know whether we can trust our mind that's what i'm saying is judge your own reaction to what we're saying forget about what i'm saying what i'm saying is right or wrong what's your reaction to it because that'll give you an insight into your own bias right and like it's not our place to say you should do something or you shouldn't do something like in terms of a moral personal judgment we can say that okay and that's why i think michael if you paid attention she's talking about the risks right this is what we know from the research this is kind of why we say what we do and if you're like pushing back against what we're saying it's kind of like you know just think a little bit about where is that pushback coming from and if you start to say that we're you know farmer shells like that's you know they surely aren't paying me enough if i'm a pharmaceutical but that's just where being a clinician i've worked with a thousand people who've smoked marijuana i've worked with a thousand people who've taken antidepressants and i've seen like on average there's a pretty different effect from both of those generally speaking when i work with people you know who come in smoking marijuana they tend to do better when we stop and and there's even you know if you look at like the va the veterans affairs the veteran study that michael talked about people will use it to manage their anxiety or ptsd or whatever right because it gives you the subjective sense of okay this is really helping my anxiety but then over time your symptoms are actually getting worse and that's where that's a really important bias to understand about the mind which is that we don't know when our our cognition is impaired we don't actually know we have a subjective sense of what our creative output is but we don't actually like measure it right we don't do that as humans we just have a sense my mind is like oh this is good and then if your mind likes something and is addicted to something it's going to over inflate the value of it in terms of an objective sense and so it's just tricky like it's sneaky sneaky mind so be careful about that you
