there's a lot about the assumptions that dating apps have which have become so true and commonplace that we've never really stopped to think about whether these are like conceptualized the right way or not and so what that sort of gives us the idea of is like since i can put my profession into my profile i can put my height into my profile i can put all these kinds of things into my profile we assume that the features of the profile will determine dating success all these people who are like doctors and still struggling to date or people who think like oh i'm a nice guy or like i do all i check all the boxes why am i still single it's because checking the boxes has nothing to do with the actual interaction you can look at like online dating and you can say like oh i'm under six feet i'm i'm screwed and we'll form these conclusions because this is what the dating app is doing is this shaping our perception that these are the things that matter so we're going to talk about dating apps for a second okay and there's a lot about dating apps that we sort of don't appreciate or recognize which is be like there's a lot about the assumptions that dating apps have which have become so true and commonplace that we've never really stopped to think about whether these are like conceptualized the right way or not so let's start with a couple of things the first is that dating apps ask you for a profile right and you put things into your profile and so what that sort of gives us the idea of is like since i can put my profession into my profile i can put my height into my profile i can put all these kinds of things into my profile we assume that the features of the profile will determine dating success because that's what i can put into the profile the biggest confusing thing about dating gaps which is dating apps which is a little bit subtle is that things that you can measure and stick on a profile may not correlate at all to dating success do you all understand that when people were developing dating apps they didn't sit down and do a bunch of research what leads to the most successful relationships what they'd ask themselves is what can we capture in a profile that leads to success because they're fundamentally bound by what the dating app can represent they're fundamentally bound by a profile and this is why a lot of people get confused about some of like you know dating stuff so people will sort of say like we we just had a post earlier where someone was saying i'm professionally successful i'm getting in shape i'm doing all these things and people don't seem to care people don't seem to care all they care about is height and weight and these kinds of things and i've i even had like so a body who was in medical school with me and so like this person had had some difficulty dating and so they when they went to medical school they were like oh once i go to med school like the ladies will be all over me because ladies love doctors right everyone's looking for a doctor once i become a doctor it's going to be easy you know i'm gonna have more than i can handle it's gonna be great and then like finish med school became a doctor started making some money and still like struggles and so then a lot of people will be super confused because they're like i don't understand like i'm a nice guy i'm professionally successful i treat people right like i do all of these things like they look at their life right because they've optimized what you can put into the app i work well i'm good at this i'm good at this like all this stuff is listed on there i put it all into the app i'm confused why don't why don't why isn't this working out and then they become resentful so here's the key thing to understand about relationships so everyone will say like relationships are all about communication the problem is like that's not something you can stick in a dating app so all these people who are like doctors and still struggling to date or people who think like oh i'm a nice guy or like i do all i check all the boxes why am i still single it's because checking the boxes has nothing to do with the actual interaction people who are successful in dating if you're wondering how can a how can someone who's broke in a heroin addict continually find someone to date it's because they're good at like interpersonal skills right so if you sort of say that okay professions don't correlate with success in dating and you're like ah you throw up your hands or if you say like money doesn't correlate with success in dating or you sometimes you think that money does correlate and you just think you don't make enough and everyone's looking for someone who makes more than you but like the fact remains that a lot of people who are unsuccessful a lot of people who are under six foot in fact the majority of people who get married are under six feet the hell is going on there right so you can sit like you can look at like online dating and you can say like oh i'm under six feet i'm i'm screwed you know short kings it's hard being short king and we'll form these conclusions because this is what the dating app is doing it's just shaping our perception that these are the things that matter but you have people out there who have all these requirements on dating apps and they're still on dating apps because they're still single because they have all these requirements and then we get into the conversation about lowering your standards and stuff like that we'll talk about that in a second but the key thing to understand is that if you're single the single most important thing the single thing it's not profession it's not how tall you are how muscular you are in fact there was recently a study that i cited and then people were wondering about the citation and stuff i looked at it more closely so people looked at six sort of dimensions of like dating success and basically like men procreating and also engaging in relationships and the effect sizes for things that they looked like like jaw size muscularity was positively associated with all the associations were tiny very very small associations as you look at big big meta analyses so essentially like what we sort of know is that like people who are under six feet make forty thousand dollars a year are still successful at dating getting married and having kids so what's the deal and then we have people who are very resentful because like i'm a doctor where are all the women or i'm a doctor where all the men right like i thought i was told that this is how you become successful at dating and the main thing is that everyone thinks that your success in dating has everything to do before the interaction that's what everyone controls you'll get that like so i need to go to the gym more i need to get more professionally successful i need to do all this stuff ahead of time and then the interaction arrives and what they're focusing on is like i don't understand why people don't respect the fact that i'm this rich or this successful or like all this kind of stuff and what they end up doing is they don't focus on the interaction itself right and this is how people who are like on paper not good mates will end up in relationships because they're actually good at like the communication and the interaction and we've got this other group of people that's like obsessed with all the stuff before the interaction right i'm gonna make more money i'm going to get more in shape i'm going to do this i'm going to learn how to cook everyone says work on yourself so i'm going to work on myself i'm going to work my on myself i'm going to work on myself and you work on yourself up until the interaction and then like you never practice the interaction you never practice communication skills you don't like practice like what it's like to communicate and be with another person right like i do you know how to flirt like because that's pretty important in dating right there's a bunch of actual skills that go into the relationship process which is exactly how people who like aren't good on paper find relationships because they're actually good at being in a relationship and that gets everyone to scratch their heads because then it's like okay how do i do that and that's where for a while you know the pickup artist community was like here's how you do that but i think a lot of their conceptions were like very toxic in nature and were born of resentment right so what they like really taught people to do is objectify women because once you make them an object then they're able they're less able to hurt you so like in order to get over your own insecurity we're going to objectify the person on the opposite side of the table and therefore like you know they're like a bot treat them like a bot like they're not a human being with thoughts and feelings and you'll sort of hear this kind of dialogue right like you'll even it's not just the pickup artist community in terms of men and women you'll sort of see this with women as well well they'll like they'll come up with like you know these terms like scrotes which are like dehumanizing terms for men and the whole point is once you dehumanize someone then like their judgment matters less to you once their judgment matters less to you it's a little bit easier for you to interact with them because then your insecurities are sort of not managed but sort of bypassed the problem is you're creating a relationship by dehumanizing the other person and it lets you get over the initial hump but it dooms your relationship to failure because now you're in a relationship with someone who you've dehumanized so the only kind of person that's going to stay in that relationship is someone who's very insecure themselves which is sort of what you see in these kind of dehumanizing dating communities is that the ones that end up in relationships are the ones that end up with doormats and what they also do is they'll like sort of like if you're not a doormat they'll like come up with all these kind of weird terminologies and justifications for why you're low value whatever right this is where like we rank people and so they do all these kinds of dehumanizing things the key thing though is that checking boxes is important by all means but if you're struggling in terms of dating like communication skills is really what it comes down to it's about articulating what you want trying to understand and making making an effort to understand what the other person wants it's about articulating your boundaries getting them to articulate theirs respecting their boundaries having them respect yours but also in sort of compromising certain boundaries which is like eye opening oh my god i'm supposed to compromise a boundary that's insane it's my boundaries people should respect it i should be able to eat cheetos and play world of warcraft for 28 hours a day if that's what i want to do that's my boundary that's what i need how dare other people cause me to respect like to alter my boundary we're not saying be a doormat right we're not saying like let people necessarily disrespect them but generally speaking a big part of relationships is compromise because each year wants slightly different things or very different things and so succeeding in the relationship is about talking about compromise but that's like that's not what we learn we don't learn how to communicate with people we don't learn how to flirt we don't learn like you know how to have a conversation around boundaries we don't learn how to express discomfort with someone we don't learn how to manage resentment so a post that we looked at earlier today was all about you know like this girlfriend dumping this guy because he's like i need more than you and that's like like the reason that relationship was doomed to fail is because this feeling started way before the person breaks up with you but they were never able to articulate it so y'all were never able to work on it so it's like articulation communication listening voicing what you want because a lot of times it's really hard to voice the things that we feel embarrassed for this is ultimately what leads to successful relationships i've had the privilege of looking into a lot of different successful relationships and you may assume for a moment that oh you're a psychiatrist doesn't mean you just look at broken relationships no a lot of the people that come into my office are not coming for relationship problems they're coming for other things right they have adhd and the only reason they survive is because they have a rock steady relationship with someone who supports them through and through so i've seen good relationships and i've seen people come in for like couples counseling and what i tend to find time and time again is what you'll hear from people is like communication is the foundation of a good relationship so the question is then people get confused because it's like i'm a doctor i make 400k a year i don't understand why i'm still single it's because you spend all your time assuming that checking a particular box will make you successful in a relationship and this is a this is a perception that dating apps reinforce so this is something that's really important to understand we tend to act based on what we can measure but it's not clear that what we measure actually correlates with success do you all get that so that one of the most frustrating things about science is that there are certain things that we can measure and certain things that correlate with success and those aren't actually the same thing so i'm going to show you all some research about this that just exemplifies this point so there's a lot of research about client and therapist matching because we can measure certain things about a client and we can measure certain things about a therapist okay like there are certain things we can like we can measure demographics right we can measure ethnicity we can look at the ethnicity of the client we can look at the ethnicity of the therapist all right and so people have been trying to figure out how to match clients with therapists for a long time let's see if this pops up oh gg okay gg psychotherapy outcome is a function of therapist patient matching on selected variables so you can look at this for a long time essentially what you discover is that it's really hard to predict so my synthesis of the evidence is that you can measure particular things about a client and you can measure particular things about a therapist but matching based on those variables really doesn't correlate success so what even if you look at sort of these meta-analyses um the purpose of this article is to examine whether therapy process and outcome are influenced by client therapist ethnicity language or gender match a review research in this area does not demonstrate support for a client therapist match on any of these variables right like what the okay so i like this this thing says that there is so what this essentially says this this article says that if you want to be a successful therapist it's not about match being a successful therapist is about adapting to the client's world view it's not about matching people we see success when the therapist adapts to the client this paper i really love because this paper wants to say we can match but it bends over backwards in order to make this argument okay i'm going to read this okay it's going to be a bit technical um so unfortunately most of this research has dealt with analog populations of clients and or therapists quasi therapy environments and criteria that are far removed from those used to judge clinical settings as a result of such disparity among methods and propulsions the results of this research in this area are far from consistent do you guys understand what this is actually saying this is saying we weren't able to find a clear effect and then they go on to say nonetheless if we ignore all the reasons why the research is bad and we can't really come to a conclusion if one considers the only the most clinically relevant studies some tentative conclusions do emerge do you understand what this paper is saying this paper is like here's a body of evidence if we discard most of it and we choose to have a selection bias tentative conclusions do emerge and then they go on to conclude namely demographic similarity between client and therapist facilitates positive perceptions of the relationship so then they form a conclusion they're like oh facilitates positive perceptions enhances commitment to remaining in therapy in treatment especially among disadvantaged groups but these this sentence right here these couple sentences on the left basically are like this isn't even correct cherry picking at its finest well said as borealis so this is what's so confusing is that when we look at like and if we look at the therapy relationship and we can we can go on so this looks at other this thing for example finds this defensive style and internal external focus does predict outcomes uh matching patient reactants potential the therapist directiveness does not affect outcomes it's just like another paper for the sake of completeness the key takeaway here is that if we look at the client doctor client relationship or the like the therapist client relationship it's a relationship that like communication and intimacy and alliance and like all this like interpersonal stuff really matters and people for a long time were like okay like if i'm an indian therapist i'm gonna do better with an indian client because i understand what it means to be indian if i'm a gay therapist i'll do better with a gay client because i understand what it means to be gay if i'm a man i'll do better at working with men we have all these assumptions about boxes that we can check and how they form relationships it turns out when you actually look at the data it doesn't work like that and what really forms connections is not something that we know how to measure but this is the main thing that dating apps do not i think they understand it they just don't tell anyone right because there's only certain things that we can measure so we're going to let you fill out a profile but like we know on the back end if you look at the data we know that like nothing that you're filling out is actually going to correlate with relationship success because we can't actually measure the stuff we can't build a profile that will allow you to successfully match people which is staggering for people and now then what happens is we start forming selections based on what can be measured but remember what can be measured doesn't actually correlate with like relationship success so now we start filtering people based on things like religion we start filtering people based on height we start filtering people based on income or we start filtering people based on political beliefs and because we're how do we filter people we filter people based on what the app lets us filter people with and so essentially what we're doing is we're making selections that don't correlate with actual relationship success and this is the fundamental problem with online dating the most fundamental problem is it gives us this idea that if i build a profile people will be able to select and i will be able to select based on other people's profiles obviously there's a key thing that's missing here which is that your selection may have nothing to do with the actual likelihood that your relationship succeeds and if we look at comparable i mean this is a stretch obviously so the therapist client relationship is not exact is far from you know a romantic relationship it should be anyway but it's still like a deeply personal relationship and we sort of know from relationship matching metrics right because the other thing about the dating apps is they're not going to publish their internal research so they can make all kinds of claims but you're never going to get peer-reviewed studies on these factors right and like why not it's because on the back end the whole freaking thing may be an absolute scam and if you actually give your data set to third-party researchers to look at it they'll say hey none of this crap actually works and then the dating app is like well then we don't have a service that people are willing to if if people realize it doesn't work like no one's gonna use our apps there's no way that they're going to do that they're not going to publish their outcomes right what they're all going to say is we have these proprietary metrics proprietary which is sort of fair and i'm sure that they're trying to figure it out i just don't know that like we can capture this stuff in the way that you know like is actually useful to people and then people get really frustrated with online dating and they sort of think like okay i'm screwing up or people are right like you think the world is terrible or like i'm incompetent or something you either blame the person on the other end of the app or you blame yourself whereas the truth is the whole system is screwed up so actually i think a good example of someone who does this well ironically i mean take this with a grain of salt is i understand that grinder actually filters based on location and distance so like what they've actually done is realized that the most important variable is like the distance between two people right which is like sort of makes sense and this is this is where it's kind of interesting because here's an interesting statistic i don't know i may be a little bit rusty on this but you know what drastically what variable of a relationship drastically increases the likelihood of divorce i want to say it includes includes the likelihood of increases the likelihood of divorce by between 50 and 100 guesses what do people think banter addiction having kids a commute longer than 45 minutes can you believe that a commute a friggin commute longer than 45 minutes drastically increases the likelihood of divorce but like the dating app doesn't have that as a criteria this is actually what correlates with divorce is having a commute that's longer than 45 minutes so we don't know what actually makes a successful relationship i i mean we sort of do it's communication skills i think is the most important thing but like this is the this is why dating is so screwed up because like it's it's giving us all of these preferences that don't correlate with the actual thing that we're using the dating app for which is to find a relationship you're looking for hookups and so that's also where grinder may be a little bit different like who knows right and so then we spend so much time and then like the other thing that happens is like it reinforces all these negative ideas oh yeah women like don't date me because of my jawline or because i'm not a sigma alpha beta omnicron omni theta delta beta male but like and people like form all these ideas where it's like no it has nothing to do with your jawline it's just like you don't know how to like communicate with people right right and so like we formulate all these different things but like the thing is like all that crap the sigma male alpha male beta male theta male fouda male omnicron right morpheus male that's great morbid mail morbid mail should be like a competitor for gmail every time you open up an email it's morbid time so here like okay so big takeaways first thing to understand is that if you think that you're dating success is determined by everything that happens before you meet the person chances are you're wrong so this is like my profession it's not that it doesn't matter it's that like everyone's focusing on everything before you even meet the person whereas if you really think about a relationship relationship starts with like meeting a person and communicating in interaction so everyone sort of assumes that okay like if my jawline isn't good enough or i don't make enough money or i'm not six feet tall or this kind of crap then like i'm doomed to be alone it's just not the case because that's not like we have a lot of data that shows that people who are in your book get a lot of women and you don't because you're a nice guy and it's not about being a nice guy or being an it's about how you communicate and interact with an actual human being and you look at these these like dating profiles and it hurts right because you're not six feet tall and you see all these profiles out there that are women looking for men who are six feet tall or men who are looking for women who are like five foot two and are like instagram models or whatever and so both sides of the equation there's a lot of judgment because these are the things that we can measure this is what we can build a profile based on and there's an assumption that selecting someone's pro based on profile things will correlate with the likelihood of a successful relationship that fundamental assumption i do not know is correct i haven't seen data that is overwhelmingly positive in that that even selecting based on these criteria leads to successful relationship and even when i look at successful relationships what i tend to find is that there's like at least one red flag and the key thing about those relationships is that despite the fact that there's a red flag the people work through that red flag together and that's when the relationship becomes really strong so for example i do a lot of addiction work sometimes what that means is the people who are married in my office or addicts or hopefully you're in recovery and what i tend to find is like yeah it sucks to be like addicted to heroin and it sucks to be married to someone who's addicted to heroin but both of y'all got together you decided that you loved each other enough and you were going to give this a try both of you all set your egos aside you set particular boundaries you kind of screwed up a little bit but you gave it an honest effort and then two years later you've been sober for two years and you decide to get married and like that's a strong relationship if you think a little bit about that like what how do you correlate that to a dating app by the way i'm an addict by the way i'm willing to date addicts no like that's ridiculous right like you don't you know so what actually leads to successful relationships is not something that dating app profiles can necessarily capture and then we got it all bent out of shape because we don't have a good enough profile or there are people who are looking for things in their profile it doesn't friggin matter at the end of the day it's about how you communicate and interact with an individual human being end of story and there's research to even suggest that all this kind of demographic matching at least in terms of client therapist and you can make an argument that that's not the case for romantic relationships but i think we're sort of seeing that people are willing to you'll have people of mixed race couples you'll have mixed religion couples you'll have mixed diet couples and you'll have people who are not those mixed things right you'll have ethnically homogeneous couples you'll have religiously homogeneous couples you'll have diet homogeneous couples and so if we have both versions what that sort of concludes is that there may not like that's not restrictive like because we see both versions we'll see a mixed race couple and we'll see homogeneous race couple ergo race may not be an important factor it's really just about how you communicate in either of those situations does that make sense so if you're struggling to date like don't get resentful just because you're less than six feet i mean i understand it's okay to get resentful but like just because you get resentful doesn't mean that that's the reason that you're single and there's a lot of stuff that you can still work on and chances are if you're like resentful towards you know the group of people that you're dating like focus on interpersonal skills what is it like to spend an hour with you is it fun what is it like to spend an hour with the other person do you know how to do things like set and respect boundaries do you know how to do things like listen and talk do you know how to do things like be emotionally available but also be able to turn off your emotional availability when the other person like needs you to like self-compose because sometimes people are in relationships and they're like emotionally available they wear their emotional emotions on their sleeve and they can never turn their emotions off so my emotions are out there all the time gushing out and then it can be overwhelming for the other person so what you've got to do is be able to turn on and off emotions right these are the core things that a relationship is built around do you have a big pp so this is another common thing so let's just understand this quickly so it's my understanding that there are people out there at pride month who are lesbians and they have very satisfying sex lives and it turns out that their pps are incredibly small in fact non-existent right so all these kinds of myths about stuff like penis size and stuff like that like it's just not like people can have healthy sexual relationships without penises i i don't know like it sounds absurd i'm not trying to be funny honestly i'm not trying to be funny here but do you all like get that like that's possible and so in terms of a healthy relationship it's about like communication and trying to figure out like how you can provide for the other person how the other person can provide for you i'm not saying that people aren't allowed to have a preference if someone doesn't want to spend time with you because of the size of your penis like that's on them and this kind of sucks for you but at the end of the day people have healthy success healthy sexual relationships without penises it's like literally a thing that people do and if they can do it you can do it is there a good way to use a dating app given what you talked about absolutely so that's a great question doughboy so the main thing to understand about dating apps is when you go in having the right expectation so there's still a tool that's how most people still connect but it's like acknowledging that it's a little bit of a crap shoot the other thing is that you should be careful about filtering your preferences so if you have particular preferences like the actual interpersonal the spark the chemistry is not determined by both you all having the same religion right there are people who have the same religion or set of values or vegan who will get divorced like you'll see like divorce in like you know based on demographic criteria like you'll see divorce on both sides right so you'll have like muslims who marry muslims and they'll get divorced and you'll have muslims who marry hindus and they'll get divorced like it happens you'll have hindus who marry hindus and they'll get divorced so that's where be like a little bit more open so i think the first thing is to understand that if someone is perfect on paper they may not be perfect in real life and if someone is imperfect on paper they may be perfect in real life so that's i think the most important adjustment to take away is to expand your dating pool and to give people an opportunity that you would normally filter out so if you have like a height requirement like loosen it if you have an educational requirement or a financial requirement loosen it give people a chance and recognize that successful relationships are not about finding the perfect partner they're about each of you becoming the perfect partner over time because you're committed to each other like you're not like any kind of like this is the key thing which is like somehow like lost this is another bias that the dating apps reinforce which is like here is who you are on a single piece of paper right like here is what you are take it or leave it when you when you started dating me i said very clearly in my profile that i will never watch morbius and you're asking me to watch it like relationships are about growing and changing together it's not about two finished products perfectly fitting together so just i would say like loosen your checkbox criteria some and give people a shot and recognize that if you find the perfect person on paper that may not actually correlate to relationship success you
