so if we really think about it when we conquer our desire to play video games and we engage in another Behavior there is no no reward in fact what we actually experience is punishment from that behavior and if we are if the our brain experiences punishment when we go to the gym or when we're productive what kind of behavior do you think it's going to avoid and what kind of behavior do you think we're going to reinforce here if you want to get control of your life and understand how the mind works check out a DIY guide to mental health the link is in description huh I want to talk to you all today about how to stop playing video games this is something that I struggled with a lot and a lot of the people in our community have talked about this a lot where you know you know you should be doing stuff besides playing video games or maybe using the internet or social media and we kind of know in the back of our mind that we should be more productive maybe I should be exercising maybe I should learn how to cook maybe I should do my schoolwork maybe I should work on my resume there are all kinds of things that we know we should be doing the problem though is that video games are actually just way more fun right where that's why they sort of become addictive because any moment that we spend playing a video game there's going to be some kind of reward whereas all this other stuff that we should be doing for some reason it's just really hard to motivate ourselves to do that and so what do we end up doing we end up trying to conquer that desire we wake up in the morning and the first thought in my mind is okay like I want to play games today I don't want to work on my resume I don't want to exercise I don't want to do any of this stuff and if you're like me what you end up doing is fighting with yourself right you try to conquer that desire you try to use willpower and discipline and you win for a day or maybe two but if you're like me eventually the the real challenge is that you know you're going to lose right so you can conquer that desire with willpower on day one you can conquer that desire with willpower on day two maybe even day three or day four but inevitably you're going to slip right you're going to go back to the video game and the challenge that I faced and maybe you feel this way too is that conquering your desires to play games feels like a war that you will eventually lose sure you can win a battle here you can win a battle there but that desire to play the game in that constant struggle that you have is never going to go away and so what I'd love to share with you all today is actually how to change that because what I've discovered and this is what's so bizarre is that you can actually change that and I know that if you sound kind of skeptical of that let me just start by sharing a story from a patient that I worked with as an addiction psychiatrist so I don't know if you'll know this but you know alcohol is quite addictive so I noticed something really strange when I was working with patients who are sober which is that once they were sober for a while they started to make really weird statements like they would say yeah I don't even think about alcohol anymore it's not actually a problem at all I don't even want to drink and I got really confused by that because I had sort of been raised to believe that the whole point of being addicted to alcohol is that you have this genetic predisposition you have these like chemicals in your brain and these neurotransmitters and neurons that make you addicted to the substance that you crave the substance you want the substance and despite the fact that it ruined your entire life you can't resist the substance and so I started to wonder a little bit wait hold on a second what's going on here because these people aren't sober anymore through willpower they're not sober through conquering their desire something has changed about the way that their desire manifests or more importantly they actually desire to not drink anymore and so what I'd love to share with you all today is how to shape your desire that you no longer even want to play video games that may sound absolutely insane but actually it's quite simple and the main principle that we're going to focus on today is behavioral reinforcement so let's start by understanding behavioral reinforcement within video games so generally speaking we have the circuit uh in the brain or this part of our brain called the nucleus accumbens and the nucleus accumbens is a very dopaminergic circuit so usually what happens is when dopamine is released in the nucleus accumbens it reinforces a behavior we want to do it more and the subjective feeling of reinforcement in the nucleus accumbens is actually enjoyment pleasure so when we sort of talk about all this dopaminergic stuff like social media or video games or things like that we enjoy doing it and those behaviors get reinforced which is why they're so hard to kick and this is the basic problem with video games right is that they're fun so every time we play them that circuit of our brain gets activated we get a little Spurt of dopamine and then the behavior gets reinforced the next day when we wake up we're thinking about video games we want to play video games because our brain our nucleus accumbens is like hey we need more dopamine so let's play again and so then we fall into this trap of okay since I have this natural impulse to play the video game that's what my nucleus accumbens wants I try to restrict it I try to conquer I try to control it and so let's understand a little bit about what happens in terms of reinforcement when we actually control the impulse to play a video game so let's say I wake up in the morning and I want the video game I want that dopamine energy expert but I decide not to so I use my willpower I activate my frontal lobes and I control the desire and then what I'll do I'll say okay I need to be productive so I will go and exercise I'm going to go to the gym today so then I go to the gym and I work out for I was planning on going for an hour but I'm kind of deconditioned because I play games all day so after about 20 minutes I'm huffing and puffing and then I come home because I'm exhausted right so I want you all to think about that for a second what do you think I'm actually reinforcing in that moment do you think that I'm saying to myself yeah I went to the gym today no actually I feel terrible I feel out of breath I feel ashamed because I was going to work out for an hour and I could only last 20 or 25 minutes I feel kind of embarrassed with myself I don't really feel good so if we really think about it what am I actually doing in that moment am I actually reinforcing the desire to exercise absolutely not the same is true for something like being productive for a day right so let's say I I have a test that's a week from today and I decide that I'm not going to procrastinate right so I'm going to study for a little while so I get up and I I force myself to study and I study for two or three hours and how do I feel at the end of that study do I actually feel great about myself usually no I start to think all these kinds of thoughts like man like I can't believe that I have to so much work to do I wish I'd gotten started earlier there are all kinds of thoughts that I have but I usually don't feel great I don't think at the end of those two hours man I'm definitely going to get an A a week from now right this is I'm doing so awesome so if we really think about it when we conquer our desire to play video games and we engage in another Behavior there is no no reward in fact what we actually experience is punishment from that behavior and if we are if the our brain experiences punishment when we go to the gym or when we're productive what kind of behavior do you think it's going to avoid and what kind of behavior do you think we're going to reinforce so even spurts of productivity are spurts of doing the right thing actually leads to avoidance by our brain we actually start to avoid productive stuff because we actually don't enjoy it at all when we do it and this is what actually happens is we can fall into this cycle where I try to resist the video game I resist for a day or two it doesn't really work out and then I I crash right so I relapse I start playing again and then I have to resist again so I muster up all my willpower and energy but the second time around it feels harder to kick the habit and the third time around it feels even harder to kick the habit and the more that you try to kick the habit the harder it becomes and if you kind of think about that wait like that's so weird why is that it's because each time you try to kick the habit and you fail to a certain degree or it's too temporary what you're actually doing is punishing yourself because all you're doing is paying the cost without actually seeing any benefit so let's just think about exercise for a second right how many days do you have to go to the gym to actually see positive reinforcement from the gym right it's got to be months it's not going to be a couple of days it's not going to be a couple of weeks we're talking about three months four months five months six months and if we look at it through the lens of reinforcement we can now see why going to the gym is hard because every day that we go to the gym we actually feel worse and there's this alluring video game over here that we can kind of tap into at any point and it'll give us that straight Spurt of dopamine so this is the first thing that we have to understand is that overcoming video game addiction is not actually positively reinforcing it's actually punishing and over time can induce our brains to avoid productivity instead of video games so now the question becomes okay what do we do about it so our strategy has to be one where we start reinforcing the right kinds of behaviors instead of when we engage in a behavior actually being punished for it we need to cultivate particular ways to where our brain can actually enjoy the activity and that starts with first of all catching your creative impulses so if you're like me part of what you may have experienced is that there are times throughout the day when you do get a little bit excited about things that are not video games maybe you get excited about reading a particular book or maybe you get excited about I don't know painting or maybe you do get excited you watch some workout video or something or you see someone canoeing and you're like man that would be a lot of fun to go canoeing or go swimming there are these impulses that we have towards the right behaviors now this is really important because these impulses come naturally they're not something that we have to force ourselves into so this is not like avoiding a video game to go exercise this is sort of catching a natural impulse in my case it's writing so that's kind of what I'm going to focus focus on but you can absolutely apply this to whatever your creative impulse is or what kind of impulses you have so I started by simply jotting things down so the first thing that we're going to do is if you have some kind of impulse try to capture it in some way so I started carrying around a notebook I installed a Notes app on my phone and what I what I started doing was just capturing my thoughts I started taking some of that creative impulse and actually turning it into something so that's actually step one is that when we have that creative impulse we want to capture it and we want to put it down into something now this does a couple of things the first thing that it does is it trains us to start engaging in things that are not video games since we already have that impulse we don't have to overcome anything but we can kind of capture it and we want to sort of get started with some kind of work the second thing that this does is gives us an opportunity for something to reflect on and that's going to be the second step that we do so if we think a little bit about how can we start to encourage our minds to have the right kind of Desire I want you to imagine a scenario let's say that a friend of yours is thinking about I don't know writing a making a video game and as they start telling you about the video game you can get excited about it too so you may want to give them suggestions you may want to say oh hey I think you should have this I think you should add that and then you kind of get excited about it the two of you all talk about it maybe even talk a little bit about collaborating and now suddenly there's excitement there's desire and if we kind of think about it what triggered that desire what triggered the desire was the input that your friend gave you your friend started talking about the video game that they made so if we want to cultivate the right kinds of desires we need the right kinds of inputs and this is why writing stuff down can be incredibly important so what I started doing is writing stuff down and then I would reflect on it right so I would pause and I would look at it sometimes I would read it so this is where a lot of people fall short because they may try to capture that creative impulse but then if you never reflect on it or never turn it into anything what is that actually going to reinforce what that's what your brain will actually learn is that there is no point in writing these things down because we never turned it into anything it's actually a complete waste of our time you spent 15 minutes writing something down and then a year later you did nothing with it so then your brain actually reinforces hey this is a waste of time we actually should not capture our creative impulses so how do you switch that around you actually spend time reflecting on it if you write for 15 minutes and you wake up the next day and you read what you wrote what you'll start to discover is that your mind will be sparked in the right way you'll start to have more and more desires you just love to think about it maybe you feel inspired to write a little bit more and so as you start to reflect on things you're actually giving your brain the right kinds of inputs that will get you excited and then once again you capitalize on those inputs so the second thing that we really have to learn how to do is reflect on whatever our creative impulses are in the case of something like exercise you can still reflect on it even if you don't feel good about it you can sort of pause after you go to the the gym and you can kind of start to ask yourself some questions you can say okay well how do I feel about what happened today instead of actually defaulting to oh man this was an absolute mess and you know there's no way we're ever going to do this again stop and pause and reflect and think a little bit critically what do I like about today what are the wins today and what are the losses today because here's the wild thing if you actually go to the gym for the first time and you spend 25 minutes there that's actually a huge W right for the first day you exercised and that's actually a huge win but unless we're careful unless we reflect properly what we end up actually doing is punishing ourselves for going to the gym because we don't see it as a w all we see are all of the thousand things that we did wrong right all we actually experience is all these negative thoughts I should have gone a year ago I should have gone longer I can't believe I'm so weak you know why am I wasting my time because this is actually what your brain is learning so how do you change the learnings you change the learnings by actually reflecting on it once you start reflecting on the exercise you'll start to see okay well actually you know at least it was a win that I went today I went for 20 minutes today if I'm lucky I can go for 20 minutes tomorrow or maybe I can shoot for 25 minutes everyone's going to start gotta start somewhere and as you start to go through that cognitive process you actually start to positively reinforce the desire to exercise the third thing that we're going to talk a little bit about is honestly originally I thought that this was kind of BS okay and that is practicing gratitude so I heard about all this practice and gratitude crap when I originally got into alternative medicine and especially when I was becoming a psychiatrist and even as a psychiatrist I thought that practice and gratitude was like a waste of everyone's time I really did not understand it because in my mind here's what I kind of discovered was like okay people are like telling me I should be grateful for stuff but why on Earth would I be grateful about anything when I have all of this crap that I need to do you know all my mind would see are all the things that need to get done I can't spend time being grateful for the tiny little portion of thing that I do things that I do right when I've got a bunch of stuff that I need to be doing better so every fiber of my being thought that practice and gratitude was BS but as I've grown and learned this is actually a huge huge huge part of cultivating the right kind of Desire so what is practicing gratitude do so if we go back to our gym example let's say that I went to the gym for 20 minutes planning on going for an hour and now I come home I feel ashamed of myself and I feel weak so let's pause for a second did I actually do the right thing today and the answer is unequivocally yes right because I got up off my ass I went to the gym and I exercised at least for 20 minutes that is way way way better than sitting at home and playing video games even if I look at something like writing I used to write and the first thing that would happen is I would think to myself how bad this writing is I would read it the next day I try to reflect and all I would see is criticisms in my mind I can't believe that it's so bad I have so much work to do I would only see the negatives with my actual progress and you think about that for a second if all the progress that you make is met by negatives in your mind what are you actually going to reinforce because every time you actually take a step forward your mind punishes you for it and so how do we stop that how do we make it so that even if I go to the gym for 20 minutes sure it's 20 minutes or 25 at least I did it right and that answer is gratitude this is the huge value of practice and gratitude you need to learn how to practice gratitude if if when you make take the right step forward if you make some kind of progress if your mind yells at you about all the negativity if it yells at you about how you should have started earlier or it's not enough or what will other people think or someone else does it better than me if your mind responds to your step forward with all of these negative thoughts then you need to practice gratitude because as your mind responds with all of those thoughts what are you actually reinforcing your mind is punishing you for making progress in life and just think about this because this is exactly why we get addicted to video games because when we take a step forward if our mind punishes us for Progress what do you think we're going to end up doing our brain learns our nucleus accumbens learns hey we can write and exercise and learn how to cook and try to be social which you remember when you tried to be social and you were filled with with anxiety and you went to a party and no one talked to you and it was a really really painful experience as soon as you leave does your mind tell you man you made a You made huge progress today right you actually like got up off your ass and you went to a party and sure it was rough but you did a good job kid like good job that's not what your mind said your mind says never again and when our mind says never again to progress what is it going to say to video games it's going to say absolutely all the time let's go so practicing gratitude is the process of any time you do something acknowledging that there are negatives acknowledging we're not saying that there isn't a long way to go we're not saying that you know you are out of you aren't out of shape like all those things can be true and you can at least appreciate some kind of positive right you can say at least I went today and once you start cultivating that what you're actually going to be doing is positively reinforcing the behavior and so if we do these three things if we start by capturing our creative impulses or capturing our impulses reflecting on our impulses and practice and gratitude what we will actually do is reinforce these behaviors in our mind as we start to reinforce these behaviors in our mind our desires begin to change because where does desire come from it comes from what's been reinforced in the nucleus accumbens since video games are so good at reinforcing stuff in the nucleus since video games are so good at causing dopamine to be released in the nucleus accumbens that's literally why we get addicted so what we need is to start cultivating the right kinds of desires and the way that we cultivate the right kinds of desires is by actually processing in the right way are creative impulses reflecting on our creative impulses and even practicing gratitude so here's the crazy thing about being addicted to video games even when you do the right thing your mind punishes you for it and as long as your mind is punishing you for doing the right thing it will always be a war that you will inevitably lose the way to win this war is by actually altering your desires and then the question becomes okay hold on a second how do I do that and this is the cycle that will lead to an alteration of your inborn desire because once I start capturing my creative impulses once I start reflecting on those things and once I start practicing gratitude that kind of progress address becomes positively reinforced once that progress becomes positively reinforced then my mind wants it again right that's the whole point behind the nucleus accumbens when the nucleus accumbens lights up it actually influences our desires the next day and this is the problem with video games is that they're so good at lighting up the nucleus accumbens the moment they light up the nucleus accumbens you've created a desire to play a video game tomorrow a simple way of looking at this is when I play a video game and I have fun what do I want to do tomorrow I want to play more of the video game if I play a video game and I don't have fun I don't want to play that video game tomorrow so what we need to start doing to create the right kind of Desire is to actually pause reflect and practice gratitude on our positive moment in our positive momentum in life and once we start to do that our brain will naturally start to create desires that are sort of good for us it'll start to want to exercise man I feel so good after exercising I really enjoy cooking I really enjoy writing I I really enjoy hanging out with my friends and our natural desires will start to change and once our natural desires start to change this is how we achieve the state of an alcoholic who's in long-term sobriety and doesn't even want to touch the alcohol anymore because that's absolutely possible and this is the sequence of events to really shape your desire to no longer even want to play video games
