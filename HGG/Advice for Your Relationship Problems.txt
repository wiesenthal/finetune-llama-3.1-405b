it may seem a little bit weird to do that if you're like in a conversation with someone please don't do that don't do that like as you're walking through the door don't snuck now um and then and then kind of just notice yeah maybe don't do that okay so my boyfriend called a twitch streamer his queen hold on a second uh i moved the overlay oh no there fixed thanks ryan let me lock these i have to lock them okay all right so my boyfriend called the twitch streamer his queen um i don't know what to what to do he says he thought it was funny i don't think it's funny at all so what should you do when your boyfriend calls a twitch streamer his queen i call you my queen all the time oh well that's delightful but something tells me that said boyfriend is not dating that twitch streamer ah what do you think um i mean i think context matters a lot if i was just hilarious set up a twitch start streaming see how he likes it when girls start simping over you yeah i mean yeah it really it's the context really matters it would it would really disturb me if you started calling other streamers your queen mainly because you don't talk like that um are there any particular streamers that it would disturb you more if i started calling them my queen yes like who um i mean i have nothing again like i really enjoy the relationships we have in the creator community but if you were to like start calling hot tub streamers your queen i don't specifically female hot tub streamers for male 1 streamers okay i would actually expect you to call male hot tub streamers or queen that sounds like something you would do s fan yeah yeah but practically i mean what do you think what do you think this person should do i mean so boyfriend is calling a twitch streamer his queen i mean i think if she's worried about like parasocial stuff or if she thinks that um you know he's like overly attached to one particular streamer i think they should talk about it because i mean if even if it is funny if and that's like a culture that she doesn't understand i think it's a good way to bridge that kind of divide um and if there's actually a problem there it's probably good to figure it out early yeah i mean i i think so this is where you know frankly krooti and i are a little bit dated when it comes to this stuff like i don't know exactly what it means if someone calls a twitch streamer their queen like you know so i i think this is the kind of thing where it seems like these kinds of things are evolving right like societally so this is where i i think you all are going to get this theme a lot today hopefully which is i think communication is really important yeah so oftentimes you know when one person says something they mean one thing and then like the other person kind of interprets it a different way um and that's just because we all you know have our own set of experiences background context that allows us to interpret things um and so i was just you know if you're concerned about it like share that share that concern with him so because this could be it could be like a meme right like we just don't know like whether it's like a parasocial relationship whether that your your boyfriend is meaning like what does it actually mean and i think especially as like relationships are evolving is terminology is evolving it's really important to try to get on the same page with your partner about like what does this stuff mean you know what how do you perceive this person um you know do you have some kind of feeling like i don't know just have a conversation about it i think that the thing that um worries me a little bit about this is like i don't think it's funny at all and i think you have to have a sense of humor about stuff like this i don't think you can come in like a tacky or that there's like only one right way about it well i mean i'd kind of attack no i mean i i'd kind of disagree there because i think that it is okay to actually like if you don't think something is funny right like it's a that's okay like let's say i'm dating someone and you know they make a comment that is yeah but don't you think that's going to put him on the defense if you just come in hot and say like i don't think that's funny at all yeah i mean i think it could put them on the defensive but that's also where like i think that avoiding putting your partner on the defensive is not necessarily the standard of communication ideally you don't want to but like if they do something or say something that's out of line and you want to hold them accountable like sometimes you know because i think sometimes in communication we try overly hard to not hurt someone's feelings like you so i'll see posts right people will say like how do i break up with someone without hurting their feelings and it's like i don't i don't think that's what this is though so i think the key thing here is that if one person thinks it's funny and the other person doesn't think it's funny like y'all should talk about it right what's what's humorous about it and what isn't um help me understand the joke right so i think this is the other thing where if you're in a situation where someone says something that's that you don't think is funny and they say it's a joke you can ask them to explain it to you right and like this is where oftentimes if people say things that are out of line leaning the joke will definitely not be funny yeah it won't be funny but this is where if there are like subsurface toxic attitudes i think asking people to articulate why they think it's funny is is a good way to kind of you know point out point that out to them but anyway so it sounds like i think this person should have a conversation at the end of the day like what does the term mean what do you think is funny what do you think about that i think um i agree i would just say try to avoid like try to bridge it don't put him on the defense about it i think you're gonna get a more genuine answer and more insight that way cool cool next okay i'm gonna go close the door real quick why don't you eat this one love oh nice okay my female 29 year old boyfriend 35 doesn't believe in marriage and it's causing me to try to lie to myself and convince myself marriage is [ __ ] anyway basically the title always pictured myself getting married and it's always something i wanted in life i'm not really sure why perhaps feeling like someone loves me enough to make me their wife or maybe the big celebration of a wedding anyway my current partner who i'm very in love with does not want to get married not to me not to anyone i'm actually his first girlfriend and we started dating about two years ago so he has been wary of romantic relationships his whole life it was a major personal step for him to enter a relationship with another person unfortunately i wasn't aware how he felt about marriage until a year in the relationship i remember him stating marriage as something he would do while we were in the talking phase but he claims he doesn't remember saying this and doesn't know why he would say it we almost broke up because of these differences but decided we still want to be with each other i love him and want to be with him and it feels silly to leave this relationship to find someone new just so i can experience being married i'm financially independent and i don't need marriage and i'm not religious either but i feel like this is going to be hard to let go of i also feel feel weird changing my beliefs for someone but then i ask myself why does it matter so much that we marry if we love each other i just can't tell if marriage really doesn't matter or mean anything or if i'm trying to lie to myself to avoid the pain of a breakup side note there's no trust issues at play here on my end at least i saw an interesting uh someone in chat was kind of mentioning so it seems like this this person had found their first girlfriend at the age of 33. yeah 33 right and uh so don't give up hope chat everyone moves at their own pace right yep so what do you think about this this situation um you know if this person was my friend i'd be pretty concerned for her because i think it does i i think there are issues here i think there is stuff that he is afraid of um it sounds like they have come to some sort of harmony around what being together means but i don't know what being married means to him and why being married is like mutually exclusive with being together um something about that doesn't sit well with me what doesn't sit well with you well because you know they're not like 21 23 where like you know her boyfriend is 35 i think he probably has friends that have been married like i don't think this is like a naive kind of decision i'm never gonna get married i think this is like a real stance yeah so i'm i'm kind of hearing that based on their ages you're sort of thinking like so early on like if i'm 23 and i don't want to get married like i still have stuff to sort out right like yeah and you can kind of change your mind about that yeah so yeah people are still like exploring stuff isn't really set in stone but by the time you get to like 35 like you should sort of have it figured out kind of well this this seems like a strong belief about his life that isn't going to change yeah i think this once again is where um it seems like marriage means different stuff to the two people and so i think like any conversation about getting married is you know you have to talk about what it means to each of you to get married what does it mean for you um well let me just think about that i don't know i don't know that it meant i just it just felt right it felt like what our relationship was like the direction that it was going like you know when you have like a puzzle piece you've got like a puzzle and there's just one piece left and then like you stick it in and it's like it's like complete and it's done and it's finished and it's like oh yeah like that's like that's what is supposed to happen there's like there's like this sense that that's just what's supposed to happen you know like that's just what we're supposed to do is we're supposed to get married like and not like supposed to and some it just felt right to get married i mean i think we talked about that right because we were dating for years before we got married it's like okay like now it's time it feels like it's time and i don't know that we ever yeah i don't know it just felt right yeah i mean we never had that conversation around like what marriage means to you no but i mean here we are we talked about it right so we talked about so there's so kruthie and i were both raised in the hindu tradition and there's this there's this like ritual that you go through which sort of binds you together for seven lifetimes yep and so when you get married you like walk around the fire a certain number of times and you know pyrotechnics because nothing makes a wedding like pyrotechnics nothing um and so we you know so i i sometimes wonder about things like that like so i don't know if you know we're we're being shackled together for seven years and i also wonder about the escalation right so if you get married in this year in this lifetime and you're supposed to be that binds you together for seven lifetimes but then like what happens if you get married on second lifetime right now he's just now it's like seven plus seven yeah like are you stacking them up we are and and so you know i suppose that's very romantic that we've but you know i don't know how was this the last one have we renewed our contract like if we renewed the lease for seven more years we have or are we just re-renewing and stacking on i don't know who knows it's unclear but it just felt right yeah i mean i i certainly wasn't gonna marry anyone else damn straight [Laughter] um anyway kind of going back to this i mean i think that this is where like so so kruthy is kind of saying you know if this person was 23 it would be a little bit different whereas like i you know i'd encourage you to almost think about this person as being early in the phase of relationship experience right yeah so this person the the woman in the relationship was saying like you're his first girlfriend so like you know he may not be ready for marriage even though the person started dating at 33 and you should sort of have your life figured out maybe theoretically by 35 i think i'm still figuring it out um this is the kind of thing where like you know so your boyfriend may have not thought about it too much right so i think a conversation about what marriage means to you what it means to him why it's important to you why he's so against it and this is also where like compromise is also important like there are things in a relationship that even if you don't want something a particular way and they wanted us a certain way or like vice versa right sometimes i think it's okay to make or it's important to make sacrifices for the sake of your relationship i think nowadays i see an increasing trend on the internet which is like you're allowed to want whatever you want which i totally agree with but then also like if people are not willing to accept you for who you are then you know like you should so people should just accept you at face value and like not ask you to change at all but i think in terms of you know relationships especially long-term relationships change and compromise is a big part of it right because a year later you're not going to be the same person you're going to be a different person that's what i'd say have a conversation about it and figure out what what about marriage or is your boyfriend reluctant about like what's his hesitation what does it mean to him why doesn't he want to do it and similarly share your perspective about why it's important to you even if it you know we're sort of hearing that financial reasons don't really matter it's not like really a religious thing it's just you're allowed to grow up in in a particular environment and just want to be married right like you're allowed to want that and and have it be a valuable part of your life and one of your goals it's totally fine yeah but i feel like the most practical thing they can do is define what it means to be together define what it means to be married and try to look for discrepancies so like you should do it your boyfriend should do it and you all should like exchange and talk about it that might be the most like or i don't know about the most but i i feel like that would be a good exercise to go through to like get an actual like a non-defensive conversation going okay next up should i wish her a happy valentine's day i started seeing this girl recently we're not dating but we went on a date last week and are going on our second this week we text just about every day would it be a little much to wish her a happy valentine's day i mean it's not like christmas or easter i just don't go around wishing everyone a happy valentine's day but i also want to reinforce that i'm not looking for a friendship with her not sure any advice this is so cute what do you think so you've been on so the scenario is you've been on one date you know you're not like technically dating and it sounds like you've got a second date this week you text every day wish or happy valentine's day yay nay i think so just i mean yeah help me understand your reasoning i mean he wants to it sounds like he wants to if he didn't want to then he wouldn't be writing this post i think but if he wants to i i i think generally when it comes to communication letting your guard down a little bit is a good thing so i i don't know if it should be happy valentine's day and that's it i think maybe some personality around it would be nice but like what i don't know let me let me let me think for a second yeah what do you think he should do so i was actually thinking that you should just text happy valentine's day right because here you are thinking about like oh my god what does it mean if i send it or if i don't send it like is it gonna be coming on too strong or coming on to i would say just send happy val if you feel like wishing you're a happy valentine's you can say hey happy valentine's day hope you're okay but you are colossally bad at texting you are like you are well hold on hold on hold on i'm not done yet i think you may discover why why you're such a bad tester because then here's the thing right so here you are in your head anxious about should i send it or not getting my money's worth this stream and and this is where once you send it then the ball's in her court right but then she has to figure out what does it mean is it too much am i too into it is he too into me like is this too much is this too little how should i respond right yeah so just get it out of your head and if you want to say happy valentine's day and if you want to you can even add a little bit hey i know we've only been on one date but valentine's day is here and i hope you're having a good day happy valentine's day you can also acknowledge that y'all have only been on one date if you really want to but or you could be a little bit ambiguous maybe this is why i'm a bad texter and then let her sort of sort out what it means right are you coming on too strong y'all with me these are all it's text where are you get me chai okay can you come here done like you were a bad texter well these are texts that i'm sending you when we're like in the same house i'm texting you from a different room right so done is like when our kids are asleep i'm letting you know that it is safe to come into the bedroom lest you wake them up okay i think you should text happy valentine's day with like a couple of emojis or something i don't know just i don't know but i think you should go for it i don't think you should not text her i'm doing it now you're texting me happy valentine's day the emojis oh nice love you with emojis i don't think i've ever gotten an emoji done texting leveled up chat right now i'm gonna text you back done okay see i how is that was that a better text learning communication so good learning learning right you got to level up there were there were double heart emojis actually it's easier i think i may just use the google suggested emojis there you go it's great let autocorrect finish your text but at the end of the day i mean i'm i'm a big fan of you know being authentic with people like you want to respect their boundaries right so like once you're authentic if they express to you some concern don't like keep hammering them yeah right so like if you text happy valentine's day and they don't respond don't be like aren't you gonna text me back like what so i think it's okay to acknowledge a little bit right where you can say hey i know we've been on one date now we're in the awkward position of like do we text each other happy valentine's day well i just hope you're having a good day happy valentine's day you're frowning is this a mistake no i i agree that you should not badger her for not responding i'm realizing that i badger you for responding okay then well i think a little bit of badgering is okay okay okay battering is fun veteran is fun yeah i mean i think that's just like you know yeah i don't need a whole lot of emotional support through text and and maybe you do which is totally fine i don't think that's what's happening okay whatever banned chat all right maybe we should keep track of dr k's performance here today do you guys think i'm in the hole or out of the hole like let's say here's the hole like are we in or out no can you please rephrase this like digging yourself away no yeah uh-huh okay no i know i know okay so we just dug ourselves into the hole a little bit more y'all let me know okay let's just let's go on don't clip it chat just move on next question next question go is it normal to develop a crush on almost every single girl you talk to i legitimately start to develop a crush on every single girl that i talk to because i was home schooled for my entire life until college is this normal oh we were thinking about homeschooling and now i'm swayed what do you think i mean normal is um i think you know your your life experience is not typical right most people are not homeschooled so i think he should forget about whether or not it's normal and more like if it's debilitating for him to be able to approach a girl or to like have normal relationships um yeah because i mean he i think you can safely say he's not normal in that kind of sense because he was homeschooled like his social skills are going to be a little atypical okay that sounds kind of brutal i mean i think i just hate the word normal you want me to take a stab at it yeah you can okay i just don't like the word normal i guess is what i'm trying to say so here's okay here's my take on this okay so if you're 19 years old you're homeschooled you go to college and you haven't really like interacted with a whole lot of people that you're sexually attracted to whether it's men women whatever i think oddly enough it is actually completely normal to have this kind of reaction and the good news is that i would guess that it won't continue forever so you're not like doomed to being attracted or crushing on every single girl that you meet for the rest of your life so let's just think about like what's going on here okay so normally we tend to go through puberty around like we start puberty around 12 13. and so puberty is like a process right so there's like a large hormonal change there are all kinds of like physiologic changes psychological changes neuroscience changes that go on in puberty and generally speaking let's just talk about hormones right so this isn't scientifically going to be technically correct not medical advice by the way um yeah but just like let's just think about so like we have hormonal fluctuations throughout puberty right so we're not you know the process of being a raging hormonal teenager doesn't happen overnight and generally speaking we we have all these kinds of interesting parts of our brain that develop like so we become sexually like more attracted to things people um you know we become more lustful right uh there's like boosts to testosterone and and progesterone estrogen all these kinds of hormones and so that's a gradual process so if you think a little bit about like what high school is like for the average teenager maybe famous last words here but you're not like constantly horny but there's like your your body's like growing right so your body's developing and adapting and that development and adaptation is happening with like regular interaction with um people that you're sexually attracted to so your body is sort of figuring out okay now we're becoming like more sexually mature we're becoming more um and as a result we're like starting to develop feelings for people so even if you think about the concept of a crush like what is a crush right it's like a strangely physiologic non-psychological like nuanced thing right you meet someone and then you start crushing on them and it's like your body is like thinking about them all the time and then like you don't really know what's going on right so i think it's it's kind of in a sense even normal because throughout teenage years if we're exposed to people that we're attracted to we learn how to like moderate those feelings we learn how to kind of calm down our body also kind of figures out oh hey like okay we're doing this thing again and then your crush kind of disappears after a little while right because it's like it's sort of a very hormonal physiologic sort of thing and so if you've missed that window of let's say 13 to 19 of like crushing on people gradually right so you get your first question when you're 13 you're like what the hell is going on and then like it kind of goes away as your hormones are adapting and changing you get your next crush when you're 14 you're like what the hell is going on and by the time you get to like 15 16 remember your your sexual maturation is continuing to increase right so like the psychological ability to deal with crushes is sort of growing as your sexual maturity is increasing if you've been homeschooled suddenly you're a fully developed sexually mature 19 year old and then you're getting exposed to like like crushing stimuli for the first time and as you get exposed to that stuff like you your body just hasn't learned how to handle it yet so i think it's it's not actually that unusual like i wouldn't be surprised that this person is in the six is in this situation i also would not be worried about it so you can always seek professional help if you want to and you're worried right that's always a good idea but at the end of the day you know i think it sort of makes sense that if you think about the process of sexual maturation and kind of like interaction with people that you're attracted to that creates a lot of like slowly building crushes that you kind of manage and stuff and this is what's going on now is that you've been sort of homeschooled for you know six years seven years during that process and now you're sort of getting like your your mind your physiology is getting exposed to these kinds of stimuli so it can be really overwhelming so i would say don't worry too much about it i'm just mentally trying to police my usage of the word exposed during this entire thing but um you know i think it's like it can be normal because normally that process is stretched out over like six years let's say and so if that process that six year process is being compressed to one year it's gonna feel particularly overwhelming and over time i think you'll you'll learn because that's what the body does like the body catches up right yep i i think this person is going to be just fine and it'll kind of pass but the good thing is that it's like every single girl and it's not an obsessive thing for like a few girls so friendly little crushes are fine okay next up your turn should i ask for my ring back my girlfriend recently dumped me completely out of the blue to be with somebody else and told me that was the reason why wait can recently dump me completely out of bloom to be with someone else tell me that was okay because okay so the person got dumped because she has a girlfriend she wore the expensive ring i bought her for christmas that she had been wanting to break the news to me she had been talking to this person behind my back while we dated and set it up so she could leave me to go be with them am i an [ __ ] if i ask for the ring back um i'm in a financially tight situation i don't even know why she want to keep it if it if if i was that meaningless to her what do you think i mean it's not an engagement ring i i think if he wants it back he can ask for it back i wouldn't i wouldn't get vicious if she says no but i bought her for christmas so [Music] he just bought it for her like a couple months ago and she's wearing it to break up i don't know i don't i just i guess i don't like this girl so if he wants his ring back that's fine yeah so i i mean i'm inclined to agree so i think like if you got a piece of jewelry especially during a part where the relationship was not like emotionally um honest for lack of a better term right right so you sort of there was something going on with your partner that was you were not aware of where she wasn't emotionally invested in the relationship and so the gift was given under the premise of being in an emotionally invested relationship so i think it's completely reasonable to ask for it back and say like hey you know i'd really appreciate it the language i would use is hey um you know in light of like what you've told me about like you've been talking to this person for a while and maybe have been like emotionally kind of like leaving this relationship for some time i think it's i'd really like my ring back and in light of what you've told me recently like i i don't really think if i had known if you had been honest with me i would have ever given it to you um if i knew how you felt which i'm totally you know it's fine that you felt that way i just wish i would have known and i kind of feel like the gift was given under [Music] inappropriate pretenses the other thing to remember is that i think it's okay to ask for it back by all means but also respect her boundary right because at the end of the day like it's a gift so it's hers now and even if it was you didn't really understand what was going on like that's the kind of thing where like you know if she decides to keep it she decides to keep it if you if you get it back please god just return it don't dwell on it why like i don't know i don't i feel like sometimes people get their things back from a relationship and then they like have the box of the relationship and then they dwell on the relationship and i wouldn't want to be to become an object of dwelling i guess by the way andy's in chat andy um milonakis hey andy hey hope you're doing well man we'll we'll find out maybe we should ask andy what he thinks about yeah what do you think andy ring or no ring um other things i'd be super curious what andy thinks about tether and things like that right because he's a he's a crypto chad but you know who who here on on twitch talks about crypto are they like crypto experts stock guy yeah i think a couple of people um talk about crypto but andy's saying he talks about nfts more than crypto andy talks about nhl but andy's saying he's an nft person okay wow yeah something i understand even less than crypto i asked our accounting people what to do about crypto and they're like really scared about it because you can have there was a post on our subreddit for somebody who wanted to donate in ethereum and the problem with that is it can be an asset that like appreciates wildly and then you're liable for taxes on that asset and then if it tanks then anyway it's a whole complicated thing okay yeah i'm his wife all right shall we keep going yeah so ask for the ring back right chat do you all agree ask for the ring push turn it if you get it i don't know about return but it sounds it sounds wise i mean he's asking it for it back because he's in a financially tough situation what's gonna do with the ring give it to somebody else give it to someone who [ __ ] deserves it like you you know what i'm saying like if the ring was bought as a symbol of love and affection give you know honor the purpose of the ring but i i'm with you i'm not saying you were to ever recycle jewelry on me i don't i don't know what i would do with that if i were to ever okay stop stop we've been together too long yeah yeah okay can we do a shorter one no no we i'll read this one okay this one's this sound looks good dude okay girl i was talking to sent me this help me decode this message this is great yeah it's a sleuthing so i've been talking to this girl from tinder for about two weeks now we've hung out a good portion of the two weeks like gone drinking playing pool movies cuddle at her place she even went to disneyland this past weekend and got me a hat from there out of the blue yesterday we were supposed to go go-karting for valentine's and dinner right after she sends me this message about six hours before we're supposed to go on our date from her hey sorry i i haven't been super talkative this last day and today i just took my me day and have been thinking about what i want and everything and i don't think i'm ready for a committed relationship i still have a lot of stuff to work through obviously and don't want to drag someone through that all in all i just really don't want to hurt you by leading you on or you thinking i'm using you etc anyways here's me over communicating again i just want you to know because i respect you and don't want my intentions to be unclear that being said when i said yes to being your valentine i meant it so if you still want to go out as friends we definitely can but i'd completely understand if you weren't comfortable with it i care about your feelings so i just want you to be comfortable i also want to make it very clear that it isn't you i cut off all dating with everyone so please don't internalize internalize it and think and and think i think lowly of you or anything like that end so we've been very open about our shortcomings and the most we've ever done is just kiss not even make out i'm just now recently getting in the dating scene and i just want to know if this text message is actually uh i screwed up the situation or not what do you think i think she should have just said happy valentine's day ironically um i'm kidding i i don't know i i feel like this is um not a well-edited text um but also yeah this is not this is not my texts are very well added and edited down to one word so edited um i think okay so his question is really sorry this thing is like in my face i can't see um i knew this was going to be a problem from the beginning use your stuff you stepped into that in the hole let's just say and i just want to know if this text message is actually a [ __ ] up situation yeah i think i think it's a bit of a messy situation that's my short answer yeah i mean you're supposed to help the dude decode the message okay let's decode it um she's not ready for a relationship i think she probably um over thinks she's like an overthinking thing um i think she's trying to be really clear that like you know it's me not you what is she saying though i don't know okay here's what i think she's saying i think she's saying she doesn't want the relationship there you go she doesn't i mean she she wants to be friends but she doesn't want to be as valentine so she'll hang out with him no she says she is his valentine but i think that's like kind of like a consolation prize no no i mean i think it's sort of like you know when you're in school and you're like in the third grade and you like pass out valentine's it's like will you be my valentine like i i think this is where there's confusion over what it means to be a valentine once again valentine's day you've been going on dates for what it sounds like two weeks right and so up looms valentine's day which suddenly adds an artificial amount of pressure of of seriousness to a relationship yeah it's like like the three stages of relationship are dating valentine's day valentine will you be my valentine engaged in marriage right so i i think what i would really interpret from this is that this girl enjoys your company but she sees this relationship as platonic and that's where like it can be painful but on the on the one hand like i think it's really actually mature of her to send this right so she's not she wants to make it clear that while y'all are kind of like having fun and i'm also getting lots of mixed signals here because there is cuddles and y'all are kissing and she's getting you gifts and stuff so i think this is the kind of thing where there's mixed signals so it's kind of ambiguous and so what she's doing is she's now drawing a firm line and she says hey this is like where my line is like i'm not interested in a relationship i'm not looking for i'm not looking to date um i said yes to being your valentine i thought that that meant something romantic but it also seems like she's saying i don't want my intentions to be unclear if you want to go out tonight as friends we definitely can um i care about your feelings which i agree with it does sound like she cares about his feelings right so she's sort of saying hey i wasn't sure exactly how i felt but that's the other thing to remember right is like when you start talking to someone they may not have everything internally figured out like we're not like you know 100 mapped about what we want i see a lot of questions in chat like well then why did she kiss him why i feel like she is um she's trying to give consolation prizes like i'll kiss you i'm not gonna make out with you i'll go be your valentine as a friend but i'm not gonna have a relationship with you and she's trying to say that she doesn't want to lead him on and i think she is she's not doing a great job of that but i i can totally empathize with this like not wanting to hurt his feelings so do maybe a little bit more than she wants to out of a sense of preserving his feelings but that's just making it worse yeah i mean i think this is the kind of thing where like people are asking why did she kiss him well i think like i was saying because people aren't monolithic right yeah so if you think about it she also gets to kiss him and then make up her mind that oh didn't like that don't want to do that again sure right that's why we progress it kind of reminds me so when my i was explaining to my mom many years ago that ruthie and i were dating oh yeah yeah yeah you've heard of the story don't okay don't be shocked it's okay all right and so she was like dating like what does that mean does that mean you're gonna get married and i was like no not necessarily i mean we may she's like i'm confused like what's the point of dating if you're not gonna get married and so like you know remember that in a relationship just because you take one step forward doesn't mean that you're you know going the whole marathon right and like people are allowed to sort of figure things out change their mind stuff like that um i do think also remember that if you're let's say i say oh i want to like start eating healthier and then it's like i'm gonna have a salad for lunch and then like pizza for dinner and people like well why did you have the salad or why did you have the pizza if you were gonna eat healthier and like you're sending like me mixed signals about are you getting healthy you're not getting healthy it's because we're not monolithic right so she may have wanted to try it she may have she may have mixed feelings and if we kind of think about it like if we actually pay attention to what she said um you know i cut off all dating with everyone so she may still have some degree of romantic feelings but internally has realized that like she needs to work on herself first before she is ready for a relationship which i think is actually a pretty mature perspective now for people sort of saying you know is he is she leading him on like there may have been some degree of that over the course of the last two weeks right because there are mixed signals but i think actually this this text is actually very clearly saying like i'm not trying to lead you on i'm not interested in a relationship here's my line and then you can sort of decide whether you want to engage with that or not last thing that i'd say is that you know if you're into someone if you have romantic feelings for someone um and they send you a message like this i'd be really really careful about continuing to engage with the person because it's hard to move from romance to like friendship not saying it's impossible i suppose a lot of people do it but then like what sort of happens is you kind of like if if you have romantic intentions in the relationship and she has platonic intentions in the relationship like i think that's going to end up probably bad but there are you know i've heard stories of you know people who sort of don't give up and they realize that they're in love and like any rom-com you know where things start out platonic and then you realize or episode of south park which i was watching recently which is hilarious this is an episode of south park okay i didn't know you still watched that part i recently started again okay um so i'd say you know if you have romantic feelings towards this person i'd hold on we had people over for the super bowl and then you went off and watched south park no i didn't watch that park yesterday okay i watched it i was like oh that's where you went dude i don't know about y'all so can like i cannot can y'all watch after watching esports i can't watch like real sports anymore like the super bowl the super bowl is is literally 60 minutes of actual competition right it's four quarters at 15 minutes apiece and the thing lasts for four hours there's like so many damn commercials so many damn pauses like i just can't do it anymore like i it blows it kind of feels like you know back when we before we had like on-demand streaming services yeah yeah and like now if you go back and you watch like tv it's atrocious am i the only one no you're not okay because i like football i think it's fun like going to a game i think is a little bit different because there's a bunch of like social interaction and stuff like that going right but and you can just watch dota at the game yeah i haven't gone that far but boy that sounds fantastic that's totally what you would do all right okay decoded decoded moving on [Music] people are asking if i'm drinking from a pitcher i am drinking from a pitcher i'm out of cups oh you are it's just water though it's not like i thought you meant like metaphorically um okay kind of terrified of making a move hey guys so straight to the you want to read this one sure hey guys so straight to the point i am an almost 29 year old man who has never dated anyone nor been in a relationship reasons include never having had mutual attraction with anyone always been one-sided either on my part or the other person's part me being unattractive it's an attractive very short dude which essentially means unattractive oh i don't agree with that and having been single for so long that i honestly can't even see myself in a relationship i don't know what it is like being in a relationship so the thought of being in one is very foreign and a bit scary tbh we fear the unknown this is how i explain it to myself so now for the situation i met someone at work known her for only a single day who comes across as a genuinely nice person who is also very attractive i would normally not even hesitate to write her off because she is too attractive and i am inadequate but i've been regretting not possibly having made a move so many times now that i'm willing to go against my fears and give it a shot i have often times read that going for co-workers is a very bad idea which i absolutely agree with but the lady seems to be worth the risk that i'm considering it so i am asking for advice should i go for it has anyone here been in a similar situation and if yes how did you proceed and just overall share your opinion in general oh my goodness what do you think i always say go for it i always say give it a shot i think i think so much of this is in his head for like how attractive or inadequate or whatever he is but if he finds her attractive and sounds like she's engaging with him i don't it'd be nice to throw up like a little test balloon without being like look i find you attractive i'm too short or whatever like i don't i think just a test balloon would be nice so like test balloon means flirting oh like get a coffee or something i don't well like i don't know what the work situation is here did it say no just at work he's he's he's known her let's known her first single day oh oh i met someone at work okay yeah he's very attractive mm-hmm yeah foster the relationship a little so yeah i i so generally speaking i'm for going for it right so i think that just go for it um after a single day what does it mean i said generally speaking we're gonna get to this in a second all right so generally speaking like in terms of of like you know if you want to wish her a happy valentine's day just like if that's what you're feeling authentically just do it right and like go go for it and respect the other person's boundaries that's my general philosophy for like how to approach these kinds of situations what but but what it works for you no no i i hear a butt coming so that that's you know respect people's boundaries but like be authentic right so just be like honest and if you feel a particular way let them know that being said especially so here's what i think is going on the first thing is that don't [ __ ] where you eat right so like don't don't start relationships in places that freeze so much what should i say what do you have an alternative i just no go ahead okay so i'd say like it work like it's kind of weird right so if you ask this person out on a date like and they say no you you're gonna have to continue interacting with them like i think there's like workplace boundaries right so we have boundaries around the workplace and so respect boundaries be authentic but respect boundaries the other thing is that i get the sense that this person is trying to like prove or grow in a particular way to like they're trying to level up their fear does that make sense like they're sort of trying to level it like so they're kind of saying like okay so i've been afraid to to ask people out so in order to level up like i'm gonna find an attractive person i'm not going to be intimidated by them and i'm going to ask them out so that makes sense like i think it's a good way to kind of approach things like approach life stuff like that is like if you have an internal sense of inadequacy and your internal sense of inadequacy has helped has kept you back from accomplishing certain things or taking certain risks you should absolutely try to level up that skill but i'd be super careful about doing it first of all at work right where there could be other kinds of consequences you could make her feel uncomfortable it could hr stuff like whatever it could make you feel really uncomfortable like you just don't know exactly like what's gonna happen there because they're complicating factors right the other thing is that you know like this sentence really bothers me but the lady seems to be worth the risk that's just like what what i'm sort of getting there is that there's a normal calculus but something about this situation is causing you to like rethink the calculus right you don't want to like if you have an equation of appropriate behavior it's like let's say i'm not going to steal but then there's like there's like a million dollars and it's like well if there's a million dollars like maybe it's okay to steal so like figure out what your you know what your standard is in life and then kind of like stick to it and be careful about making exceptions because i don't know what part of your body you're thinking with at that point so i'd say be a little bit careful about you know trying to level up in a work situation and you know if someone is worth the risk like that just something about that doesn't sit right with me the single day is kind of what's i mean i'm excited for him that he's finally excited and thinks that there could be there after you know not having any mutual attraction with anyone yeah i mean i i'd say you know if you do if you do want to pursue things in some way i'd i think ruthie's like right in terms of like test the waters right so try to have a conversation first like you know this is where also i wouldn't recommend that you flirt at work but like being a little bit flirtatious is the way that you test the waters right that's what flirting is it's like testing whatever clearing is well what would you call it i don't know i don't flirt at work one day we are gonna have to do some kind of stream or share what it's like to actually be married and work together yeah maybe um so that that's interesting though because we you know we were in a relationship before we started working together which i think is like actually better right than the other way around but i don't know maybe we've done a couple of working relationships too like relationships where we are working on something together it's like always intense stuff yeah yeah well okay well i mean i feel like camp was sort of a dating service okay extracurriculars clubs i don't know anyway so i would say kind of if you're kind of terrified of making a move like i would not recommend making a move in this situation don't do some big gesture gentle gentle proceed gently with caution yeah chat wants me to teach them how to flirt okay what do you think go ahead you want me to flirt with you right now that's not what i want it's what chat wants well what do you want i want you to flirt with me right now i can tell that's how you do it easy done too easy see work real quick i'm busy i'm busy and busy you like me too i do because i don't i don't invite flirtatious attention because i'm a married lady well i mean i i'm super lucky that you don't invite flirtatious attention because if you did you'd get like so much of it yeah that's why puerto rico's fun i can imagine right so i think that's that's a good example you get a lot of flirtatious attention friends you've always gotten flirtatious attention i don't think so oh my god those nurses i mean that's so hospitals are just a whole different situation she doesn't count in hospitals is that what i'm hearing no no i i i also am very very careful about you know the kinds of you know i started you know wearing the ring recently because i was getting yeah you were you were really getting quite a lot so we just have to be careful there right so we want to set boundaries and the ring is one way that you indicate a boundary to other people so but in terms of flirting i i don't know like what did you like because it was pretty easy right because i was like oh do you want me to flirt with you you're like no i won't rotate it it's like look it's the look it's the set of the chin yeah and the eyebrow eyebrows yeah accent what about the flaring of the nose accent is really just not a good way to go friend yeah so i think you know in terms of flirting like try to make her laugh like true you know make her feel special yeah and yeah i i don't know i mean you all saw what happened there right so how would you how would you just yeah just so this is the kind of thing where like whatever whatever they send your way like play with it don't argue with them right so if she's like oh chat wants me i don't even remember what i said it just felt pretty easy it was easy yeah you're easy um it's true yeah right so that's the kind of thing where you could have responded with oh no you're easy but that's a little bit aggressive it's like yeah you're right yeah and then she laughs so you got to be careful because like in there you can say oh you're easy but you don't want to say that like you're like yeah i'm easy take advantage of me please you know that's that's the attitude you don't say that no it's okay it's easy it's good it's good you see what i'm saying yeah you see what i'm saying like you just like you don't want to say take advantage of me because that's a little bit forward right like it's like heavy-handed maybe a little bit creepy it's like oh take advantage of me baby like that's you know what i mean that's too much so the attitude it's about facial expressions non-verbal communication um like you don't you want to sort of say like yeah i am easy like what are you gonna do about it you know what i'm saying yeah yeah the wiggle is good yeah right so i got i got a really good tip um many years ago from someone who was doing teaching us how to give speeches this is back when i was in residency and so she was saying like you know as you're giving a speech um like come up with the first paragraph and she had us us uh throw and catch balls while we were like delivering the speech and what happens when you're like tossing a ball back and forth with someone else who's like giving a speech is that there's like movement involved and it kind of like loosens you up so like a lot of people are really nervous but like physiologically if you like move physically while you're sort of practicing to give a speech it kind of like reduces that tension and makes you feel a lot more natural so i think a lot of the movement is is really good and you don't want to be like so the whole thing about flirtation is that you don't want to be heavy-handed right so you don't want to say like oh take it the whole point of flirtation is that it's like subsurface communication yeah that's the whole point yeah and so then that that's the kind of thing where it's like with innuendo plus like facial expressions like you can you know a little bit of like loose movement confidence you're not tense you're not like hahaha let me flirt with you please m'lady right so you want to just be chill like and also remember that if you're trying to flirt low expectations for yourself and the other person right so the goal should be that both y'all should walk away from the interaction having enjoyed the experience it's not about trying to get laid or trying to get a date or anything like that it's just like let's have this brief interaction and if she's laughing at the end of it that makes me happy we both sort of enjoyed that you know and then like you can kind of like walk away if you need to right so you don't want to get overly invested you want to steer clear of stuff like worth the risk um so so just try to have an engaging enjoyable interaction with another human being without attaching too much to it yeah they agree with that a lot don't don't try to seal a deal or get something out of it it's just having fun in the moment yeah like and and so i think that's where being attractive to other people is about you know being enjoyable to spend time i have a question yeah okay so i know what alpha is i know what a beta is what's a sigma ah so chat may be able to answer better but i think sigma is someone who just has their own plan like doesn't play the game and plays like their own independent game okay right so like in in the super bowl for example right so you have the winners and the losers and then you have the people over here playing dota who are the sigmas all right got it is that is that correct he knows that sounds good i've got my picture i may go get some tea or something though see sounds nice what kind something easy green tea sure you want to handle the next one sure oh this one's loaded chat okay i'm gonna go i need to go pee and yeah you go do that i'm just gonna hang out with chad i'm not gonna do a subreddit okay okay okay you want munchie i don't want to munch on the microphone no munching on the microphone love you too hi happy valentine's day chat what can i do for you oh thanks didn't they do such a good job on this office they really did great how is it living with dr k um it's amazing he does he does so much that i don't really realize until like he's gone so like he always knows where my phone is my phone is always charged he used to keep up with my glasses too but i we haven't seen a pair in a while um he's super thoughtful like he's always like i'm gonna be out running errands do you want anything or um you know like if he's going from this room to that room he's always like multitasking like oh i'll take this to that room with me um i mean there's like some drawbacks too because stuff tends to get shifted all over the place but um he's great he's a great dad like his stories are like i like listening to his bedtime stories and his like dinner time stories so the girls are like tell us a story he tells a story and he's trying to eat but i'm like tell us a story [Laughter] um he's great really he's very like he's just a person who likes taking care of people tell us two bad things about dr k please um well you guys probably know this but like he definitely burps a lot and the other bad thing he he used to well no that's i can't think of another one this is weird it's all i got he burps a lot um you've never seen moist critical i see a couple of his clips sometimes but i don't know if that was directed at me or not dr k called himself a loser so what made kruthi fall in love with the loser he wasn't a loser he wasn't he was he was um he had really short hair at the time so like you know he just didn't look his best um he also didn't really care about like he didn't really know how to dress and stuff like that um so i think he just wasn't like put together in that way but he was also like 17 18. um no no no no sorry he was like 21 when we started dating um he wasn't a loser i don't think oh my god when will we see photos of young dr k you know we didn't have smartphones back then so they're like printed out pictures buried in an album somewhere wasn't he failing yeah but a lot of people that doesn't to me default make you a loser but yeah he had some he had some academic problems did i dress him up i don't no i didn't dress him up he he gets most of his uh fashion advice from his brother and a couple of his friends and then he like kind of finds like the jeans that fit him and he just gets in every color he finds the shirts that he likes and he just gets in every color which i think is actually a good way to go it like really simplifies the decision making are you 50 years old no i'm not um he should dress better okay indian accent please i can do a little bit but my accent is not so good also my accent is more like an uncle than an auntie i cannot do it an anti-accent i can do uncle accent that's all do i speak hindi i studied hindi for two years but um i'm pretty i'm pretty awful i don't speak gudrathi very well either how have you contributed to how he is now i try not to think about that too much because i don't like the idea of like taking credit for somebody else's life or growth but um i think i think i mean we we very much are who we are because of each other's support and encouragement so i'd say i've contributed but i don't want to take credit for all of the amazing things that he's done how can you tell when a girl is interested in more than being friends okay the simplest solution is how much time she gives you if she's giving you a lot of time she enjoys your company and will want to i i think because i don't give my guy friends that much time um you know it's like you're more compartmentalized in a person's life um but when you give somebody a lot of time that's when i think you can signal that you could potentially explore taking his relation that relationship further which part of india you belong to ethnicity wise where gujarati how did you succeed in education college success is a weird word um when it comes to academics i personally i i went to school to learn i didn't really care about the grades i learned i went to school to learn and to network and to like develop skills um i think all look you know when you're in an academically inclined trajectory it's really about performance and like the next step what are my thoughts on polygamy um i've never seen it succeed um i've i'm sure it works for some people i just don't know them how do you practice and get better at playful teasing flirting without creeping people out i mean it's a good question um [Music] it's hard because you know if you're only thinking about like am i creeping someone out am i creeping someone out it's going to be kind of debilitating in the moment to actually flirt um the best advice i would give you is do it in like very low risk environments and like you know if you're out traveling and you're never going to see these people again or at a coffee shop or something i would start with a compliment some sort of compliment that's fairly innocuous i like shoes where'd you get them like that kind of thing and see where that opens up how do you balance helping a friend romantic interests mental health with your own mental health oh that's a good one um i think i mean you it's not your job to balance your mental health with your partner's mental health i think that is something that you would want to both engage external professionals to help you figure it out individually and then talk about it together so i would kind of say like you each need to work on yourself and then share progress with each other and what that means for your relationship why do you pick the weirdest chatters i don't know sorry i don't think they're weird um kruthi how hold on sorry stop scrolling how big is your biceps not that big um do you like seafood i love see okay no i want to say i love seafood but olig and i have learned that we don't actually like seafood we like fish and this was like a realization because we would always get like you know the seafood medley and be like uh don't like half the stuff in here we love fish okay on the seafood but i love oysters all looks okay on them what kind of art do you like um i like sculpture a lot and actually i got all of this really cool painting i don't know where it has gone um but i really like art that um as a little bit playful and a little bit escapist like you you think of a time or a place or a memory that kind of thing you love the lamps i think they did such a good job with the lamps i agree um where is my doc i need my doc now that i am having a heart attack i'm alone on valentine's day i don't know but this is not medical advice so if you're having a heart attack please see a medical professional but olig will be back soon he's making tea um have i ever struggled with a breakup yeah i have before olig and i got together i went through a really painful breakup um it was really painful i was also pretty young um so i didn't i'd never been like rejected before um and that was really really hard it was very i didn't feel like myself i felt like i had um lost a lot of like my confidence and like aspects of my personality that i never even thought twice about i kind of was second guessing it really it really threw me for a loop um i was really i was really hurt it really hurt my feelings um how does one be in a relationship with the gamer boy who has never had one honest question how does one be in a relationship with a gamer boy who has never had a relationship um [Music] okay i have a thing where i think we generally like over analyze the labeling um and so if you're like i want to be in a relationship i don't know that we're clear always on what that means like what does it mean to you to be in a relationship because i think you can be in a relationship without having the relationship label and that kind of makes it easier and then once you get you know far enough along in that you you do want to define it right because otherwise it's going to be very confusing what did i think of olig when i first met him i thought he was i thought he was either going to i thought he was going to end up becoming a cult leader honestly that's what i first thought here i am spearheading the cult what did you do for valentine's day well it's only 1 30. but olig went and got flowers and i made him an egg sandwich and he made tea so it's i think just small acts of service so far it's hot okay thank you okay we can keep going yeah let's do it oh you know i can do this one my 24 my uh i'm so jealous that you just get to hang out with chat three times a week dude it's great i want to hang out with chat three times a week i want to stream more to be honest yeah like so i i don't know about y'all but like i started playing lost ark and that game is amazing um the the challenge is that so someone was asking for a disco elysium play through with like commentary which i think would be a lot of fun i think the challenge is that we kind of struggle because it's like some people come here for lectures or interviews or whatever right and so like i'm struggling because on the one hand it's like i want to just it's like i feel like i don't get to be a regular twitch streamer you know um but i i think it'd be great to just play lost ark i think you can right alt account i think is a great idea uh i i don't know how to do that but um but yeah i i would i would love maybe we'll uh but you have to also let me play what do you mean let you play no you have to like let me play for time like you know i know i mean i know i have been playing but i'm saying like you know that'll it'll be like a stream like so i can't just like stop you know what does that mean it means that normally when i'm playing games like if we need something like one of our children is right i mean i can't stop your children from needing you yeah but you have to like cover for me and take care of them yeah i can do that yeah okay not like every day not every day okay we'll figure out a schedule eight hours on a saturday all right that's a lot okay so maybe we'll see we'll see chat i think we can get through some of we've got we've got kind of a very full schedule for the next couple weeks with some coach training um but i can i can help you find some time okay um okay let's keep going so uh my boyfriend is blaming his cheating on me oh fun hi reddit i caught my boyfriend of three years texting a past [ __ ] buddy sexually explicit conversations this has been going on for over a month i think we've all seen these posts before so i won't go into a ton of detail the real problem is now he's blaming me for his unhappiness in the relationship and that's why he cheated i didn't try hard enough i never solve problems i always argue i don't believe he feels any real remorse and this is probably what hurts the most psy anyway any tips or advice on how to regain my sanity and try to rebuild confidence edit to say and this happened all on valentine's day ouch ouch that's rough that sucks um yeah i don't i don't like that he's blaming her cheating is one thing and it's obviously not great um but blaming somebody else for kind of your misdeeds is i feel like that's what makes this whole thing unsalvageable yeah i mean i i think that first of all it's not this cheating is also pretty egregious it's not like oh it happened once this this feels unfixable um regain my sanity i think that's the big question right yeah so i think the first thing is that this is not that uncommon right so when we make bad decisions we oftentimes want to provide rationalizations or justifications for them so this is something that i've heard a lot like professionally that you know people will say like oh kind of you pushed me to cheat um and so for example like the the boyfriend is kind of accusing this person of didn't try hard enough never solve problems always argue um and i know this is gonna sound kind of weird but like there there may be some truth to that so for example like in a relationship like if you think about someone who's gonna cheat chances are there's gonna be something about the relationship that they're unhappy with right right um not necessarily i mean they could be perfectly happy with it and just wanna cheat anyway but so so and that's what can be so hard is like when you have a combination of something legitimately that's not perfect in the relationship which is going to happen with every relationship and then you have someone using that as a justification or rationalization because remember when when our mind justifies or rationalizes things it doesn't justify with falsehood it justifies with truth right but that's the tricky thing about the mind is that like it's going to justify in a very selective way so this is where like you know the simple response would be like you know if you thought i never solved problems like why not like talk about it right like like this is where even if if person a is doing some things that are not perfect in the relationship like arguing or not trying hard enough whatever the hell that means um then like how does that justify cheating right like that doesn't there's a huge logical misstep there that oftentimes once we start rationalizing or justifying like we just sort of miss and this is where if you've ever been in an argument with someone and they like you know criticize you for something like what's your first response is to criticize them back right so it's like oh like you didn't take out the trash well like you don't take out the trash like blah blah blah right like you don't know and that's just naturally what the mind does that's what the ego does so there's an ego component to this it's kind of unfortunately common i think the other sort of sad thing and this is how you if you want to regain your sanity is like if if your boyfriend says or girlfriend says you didn't try hard enough so i cheated on you it's like do you want to be in that relationship to begin with in the sense of like you know how hard do you have to try to prevent someone from cheating right i get sort of the sense that the boyfriend is not putting as much effort into the relationship like and so in his mind he may be in a weird way fair that if he's expecting his girlfriend to do 90 of the work and never solving pro like if you're expecting your girlfriend to solve problems or your boyfriend to solve problems like that's the kind of expectation that i don't think will lead to a healthy relationship because i didn't try hard enough i never solve problems i always argue if in a relationship the opera the subject of the sentence is not we or us that's going to be a problem and that's a fight that i don't think you can win right like that's the kind of situation where if you kind of feel like um you know if you get accused of not solving problems or not trying hard enough or always arguing like the question the response to that for your own sanity is what is my partner putting in right because it's like shared responsibility solving problems in a relationship is not something that i have to do or she has to do it's something that we have to like do together that's the whole point of the relationship so i think that a couple of things to remember if you're trying to regain your sanity is first is that people will justify their bad behavior by pointing out things that are somewhat legitimate but are actually like not the whole story right so maybe you could work on your communication a little bit but just because you know you can work on your communication doesn't justify his cheating the next thing to think a little bit about is that like if you're in a relationship where where the person that you're with is not willing to like share responsibility for relationship problems like i never solve problems i didn't try hard enough you know that's the kind of thing where it's like that's shared responsibility right because it's a relationship so that's where you know the fact that he doesn't feel any remorse i think should sort of tell you in a weird way that like you're probably you know that's kind of weird like he cheated on you if you really thought the relationship wasn't working out the right move is just to break up with you right so say hey this relationship isn't working out for me like i'm gonna it's not to like text people sexually explicitly why it's hard for me to hear you say like this relationship isn't working out for me like just those words coming out of your mouth um this relationship was working out for me this is great yeah i like this love you love you too um but what about regaining sanity and rebuilding confidence because that's like yeah so i think oftentimes when we get dumped we like we accept the other person's perspective but i think this is where it's important to remember that like just because someone blames you for something doesn't mean that it's accurate right right and so this breakup has a lot more to do with in my opinion i mean maybe we're getting one side on the internet you only get one side of the story right but um you know what what we're sort of hearing is that if there were problems in the relationship we're not really hearing what that looked like in terms of solving problems or trying hard enough um but it's very possible that there is like we've been saying there's some kernel of truth so this is where like if you want to regain your sanity anything that you could have improved on in the relationship you kind of work on for the sake of your next relationship but you also don't accept what this person says because at the end of the day they were like sending sexually explicit texts to you know someone that they were sexually had a relationship with so like that's not on you right like that's on them yeah so i think a lot of the lost sanity comes from when we start to accept responsibility for other people's actions which is what they try to do like so when someone blames you like they try to make you responsible for their actions thereby absolving themselves of blame and if you sort of don't let them do that right so hold them accountable for what they did and also accept accountability for what you did i think that's ultimately how you become sane and then prepare yourself for a healthy relationship next time around i think practically getting away from him your mutual friends like that environment for a little while would be good i mean this is i don't know if it's like the most healthy coping mechanism or not but personally i would just want to be away from it and that also means like social media like just disengage from social media for a little bit um i think what you're trying to do is get him out of your mental space and not um spend your mental energy dwelling on what you did wrong what like replaying all these arguments i think it's gonna happen but i think it needs to be away from your day-to-day environment that you shared with this person next yeah dopamine detox i see that in chat did did we want to tell people where they can sign up for dopamine detox stuff um so i think there's some kind of dopamine detox stuff going on on our discord i hear it's going pretty well uh so this is a community driven event to help people develop a healthier relationship with technology so a lot of times if you're trying to like abstain from technology use it's super super challenging so we have a community driven event that's going on right now that can help you kind of plan and figure out okay like what are you going to do on day one what are you going to do on day 2 day 2 what are you going to do on day three um and it looks like it's at 11 a.m central time on what day though is it every day every friday at 11 a.m central time so if y'all are interested in developing a healthier relationship with technology detox from stream if that's what you gotta do do it no i mean that's yeah you know that's good i think that as much as i love chat and as much as it's nice if we have viewers like if you all spent a month not watching not engaging with any screens like i would be happy yeah so what if our viewership goes down like that's not what we're here for terrible cult leaders yeah so bad ultimately like it's for your benefit and if stream helps you get there then by all means watch but if joining a dopamine detox and staying completely free of twitch or whatever else like that's we want you to be healthy happy right yeah does everybody know what dopamine detox means um so i i don't know if people are super familiar with it but i think that y'all can show up on fridays at 11 and kind of talk about it um i think i'm gonna do it i've been spending way too much time on social media lately all right i'm gonna do it okay um okay let's move on so how do you converse with really attractive people i frequently find myself just drifting away when talking to a person that really hits that bar of attractiveness it's not even like i'm fantasizing about that person but there's a part of me that just wants to sit and stare at the work of beauty that i'm looking at and not pay attention to a single word being said and that in the past has come off really wrongly to avoid such a situation from arising i normally avoid contact and or act cold but that is not what i want to do either i just want to treat them like i would any other person because i think that it's unfair of me to treat someone like that for no fault of theirs what causes this reaction it is probably there was a result of some of there being some sexual attraction but why does it result in such a reaction dr k talked in a recent video about how he doesn't care that the other person in front of him is attractive or not this blows my mind how do you become a child and most importantly what what do i what do you think i can consciously do to navigate that situation can you truly beat the ancient reptilian brain inside you should you what do you think this this is what happens to me every single time you know people think that i'm a chad but every time i see you it just i lose sight of everything i can't concentrate that makes you not a chat and i was like excuse you um all right [Music] what do you think i get tongue-tied sometimes when you are talking to me yeah i mean i get it i don't i thought that was a critical fail chad i don't think that was a critical hit right so this is where like you know you're not gonna bat a hundred percent which is fine no i mean i think it like it's almost sometimes people are so attractive they're intimidating and i wonder if this is more of like an intimidation thing than like uh oh my god they're so attractive i can't function does that make sense yeah i mean i think that um you know we can take some so the the mind and brain and sense organs tend to acclimatize to stimuli so if you think about like you know if you walk into a house where there's food being cooked the first thing that you smell is the food but as an hour goes by you're you'll acclimatize that stimuli and you'll start kind of extinguishing it so i think the first thing to consider is that you know you may have some kind of reaction but that over time that reaction should diminish okay the second thing that i'd say is that you know how do you so if you have some kind of reaction whether it's to an attractive person or you know fear every time you step out you're outside your door or you know being afraid to close your eyes when you go to sleep like whatever kind of reactions you have try to understand like acknowledge that it's happening and try to understand like what's happening and where it's coming from so i don't necessarily mean in like a deep-rooted psychological sense like what is the physiology of this reaction so this is where a lot of times we automatically sort of shoot for the mental side right oh my god like what does this mean like mentally am i intimidated right so that's a psychological interpretation but oftentimes our our mood or mental state in our body will go hand in hand so when you feel like crying you're going to feel like a lump in your throat you'll feel tightness in your chest when you feel nervous there'll be like butterflies in your stomach right so our physiology is a big part of our experience of things right it's not just mental so the other thing that you can always try doing is like breathing into it so we've done several meditations about this that are sort of like oriented towards emotions but you know if you see someone and you kind of notice yourself having this reaction i wouldn't avoid eye contact or act cold i mean i know what you kind of have to it maybe at the beginning but this was just like take a deep breath and kind of sigh you know it may seem a little bit weird to do that if you're like in a conversation with someone please don't do that do that like as you're walking through the door don't snuck now um and then and then kind of just notice where yeah maybe don't do that like i said we're not batting 100 today chat um yeah just go right and they'll do that and then you'll be then you'll be totally fine um so yeah so i'd say you know just notice that reaction allow yourself to have the reaction oftentimes through suppressing our reactions to things that's how we keep it there so you want the reaction to kind of wash through you if that sort of makes sense right so what you want to do is like oh like okay so here here we go again right so you don't want to say that you just kind of want to notice it and just kind of all right just kind of take a deep breath and just like engage with the person sort of start to think a little bit about okay what were they actually saying like let me try to really focus and concentrate on what this person is saying and interact with them as a human being and as you sort of breathe a little bit as you acknowledge what's happening is you kind of let that reaction wash through you hopefully you'll start to just be able to talk to them and the good news is that it's kind of interesting i just realized another thing so if you're avoiding eye contact and remaining cold you're not giving your mind oh this is actually really interesting you're not giving your mind any kind of distraction so this could in a weird way make things worse because yeah if you engage in a conversation and like that conversation is engaging then your mind will be able to distract itself from whatever stimuli you're kind of dealing with and you can actually like talk to the person right so be present with them and the more that you kind of avoid eye contact and act cold like the more like the only thought in your head that you're sort of experiencing is that drifting away around their attractiveness so interestingly enough i wonder if that's actually like not is hurting more than helping okay i've got a couple of like practical tips wear sunglasses like give yourself a little bit of grace on the eye contact and stuff um the second is smile because when you smile and the other person smiles back at you that'll help you relax i think and you won't be like oh my god they're so attractive they're so attractive they're so attractive oh my god i think if you can kind of go into it with a smile and like get some positive feedback from them don't do that fake smile though let's face it allocates a smile do this one that's a better smile you can see the difference don't do a fake smile you want to show them the fake one that's the fake one and this is the real one i see the difference i've had to fake smile a lot these days please anyway uh but yeah i think getting some positive feedback so it doesn't feel so like you're talking into a blank wall um sunglasses smile i feel like i had a third one but y'all are so attractive i forgot [Laughter] okay um yeah so i think we're about done you want to do like one or two more what do you think kim you wanna just hang out with chat they had a lot of questions about what about everything i mean we have we're gonna have to wrap up in a few minutes yeah but why don't we just hang out with them for a while instead of sure another subreddit yeah so what are y'all what are y'all playing on lost ark like what's good i'm playing uh a sorceress wizard i'm playing a dwarf you're not do you want there are no dwarfs unless okay i was like how long can i get away with it which class is best chat doors is pay to win sorceress his sorcerers pay to win mostly team dwarf dude that'd be awesome i'd play dwarf in lost ark if there was one is there one i may just be mistaken classic psychiatrist you know what's epic is deep rock galactic hmm if you want to play dwarf you should play deep rock i'll play with you yeah let's play deep rock okay our kids like it too yeah they're they're really intense about it i'll look um he put some on his lap and then you could you do like the controlling right and then they just dig no no so so they know they know the three buttons so they have they can shoot they can jump and they can use things like the interaction so i will aim and i'll move and they'll perform all the actions if they like freak out he'll be like get a movie get him get him and i'll hear evie like ah they're coming yeah it's really great the one one of the kids really loves skyrim and like kind of likes it too much so we had to stop playing it because it was like but she's totally into like dual wielding axes like i was like oh do you want to use a sword and she's like no i want two axes and she likes uh she also likes to use different kinds of magic so she's super into it but where i i started playing pokemon with them yeah that's they seem to seems to be like good enough for them yeah they're actually able to play that and then evie tilt or veer tilts pretty hard on mario right mom get it get it yeah i think that's just she's she's her her tilting pretty hard on mario is a consequence of her like actually understanding the game so i think it's actually a good milestone oh okay right because now she like understands the mechanics and she understands like when to be frustrated and you know and i was like trying to explain to her i was like you can't bubble because like i i could die on this level right like so i you know i need you to like be alive so that i can respond and she's like no but i'll just bubble with like things she's like no she like does not wait she's like mom we're going she'll just go oh yeah she has no presents she has no idea of like where other people are and so she'll just leave us behind indeed dota yeah i don't know if they're ready for that nobody's ready for that that too i was surprised because i thought that in dota they would like like crystal maiden right because they're super into frozen but they like avi likes like viper and all of the monstrous creatures there's a lot of monster empathy that's really interesting all right you wanna do one more then any questions in chat or are we good yeah i think um we're gonna have to wrap up so chat who do y'all wanna raid oh thanks for dropping by guppy face hassan asman dude i was watching asthma stream the other day he had 400 000 viewers and he couldn't even log into lost ark yeah it was it was uh it was okay we can who is anyone else doing like um valentine's day related content radalinity i haven't heard people asking to raidalinity in a while how do you defeat fomo i like that question what do you think how do you how do you okay well ray d'alene how do you defeat fomo last question um in my opinion like i i get fomo when i'm trying to see what other people are doing and like i want to do that i wanna do that one do that and the best thing for me is like well what do i wanna do and then i i host the event or i like throw the thing or i start the company or whatever so i think for me it's initiative that helps me with fomo instead of like trying to see what other people are doing and catch in on that um to kind of make my own thing to do yeah i know this sounds kind of weird but it's part of the way that i deal with fomo is just to recognize that most things in life i'm gonna miss out on right if you really think about it like you're gonna miss out like of all of the experiences that human beings can have you're gonna miss out on you know the vast vast vast majority like think about all of the bread that has been baked in the history of humanity and all the delicious fresh loaves that people have kind of eaten and you're not going to get to eat most of those this was really hard for me especially when i was like when i started to get like serious professionally because i'd miss things like i'd miss like gaming launches and stuff like that right so ff14 is something that i really like missed out on because i've heard that if i had been playing ff14 over the last like three years it would have been one of the most awesome like gaming experiences but that's just you know you're gonna miss that that's okay and this is where i think a big part of fomo is the idea of like what's truly limited did i miss out on ff14 sure was it epic certainly sounds like it and like lost ark is out now and it's not like there won't be other epic rpg experiences available you know so it's okay to miss out on things like life is not really about trying to do everything it's about really appreciating like what you have and what your opportunities are because the vast majority of stuff you're gonna miss i know it sounds kind of weird but like just really think about that it's okay to miss stuff it's not like opportunities are really limited right oh you didn't get to go to dinner this week like there will be more dinners in the future there will be more games in the future there will be more things in the future oh i really want to play lost ark i really want to play i really want to play like i'm going to stay up till 5 a.m it's like what do you think is gonna happen tomorrow like you're gonna you can play tomorrow it's not like servers are going down in a week right so what's the rush never know when the servers are going to
