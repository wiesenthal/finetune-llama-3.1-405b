foreign [Music] [Applause] [Music] it ain't a stream unless there's a technical difficulty chat am I right am I right welcome to another healthy gamer GG stream but this stream is different because today we're streaming in a different place and talking to different people and I've been reading a lot of y'all's comments on the internet on this place called YouTube where we upload these things called videos and on the videos there are people who will leave comments and we realized recently that these people are really amazing that they will talk to us on this platform that we are pretty unfamiliar with and so we decided we're going to try something different today we're going to try streaming on YouTube because I want to talk to you all so welcome to another healthy gamer GG stream our inaugural stream on YouTube and yeah welcome so just a reminder that although I am a psychiatrist nothing we discuss on stream today is going to be taken as medical advice everything is for educational or entertainment purposes only if you all have a concern or question please see a licensed professional so I'm thrilled but I need some tech support chat the first thing is I realize I can't chat I can't talk to y'all because apparently I am not subscribed in order to chat you have to be a subscriber which is great please subscribe um and and uh I can't I can't talk I can't type to y'all because I'm not I'm not subscribed to our YouTube channel so I gotta figure out how do I subscribe to our YouTube channel because I can't type normally I can type um so so maybe someone can work on that I will ask someone and guess what that is going to that is going to mean that we're we're gonna get one additional subscriber today chat already we're working on it um and I I noticed uh someone um had a message hello I just wanted coins and capsaicin nice I just wanted to say I've used some of your tips to make my life better thanks for all the content you create it has helped thank you very much for the five dollar tip we appreciate it I'm really glad it's able to help you um and yeah I I don't I can't log into anything right now Tech teller but um we're really glad it's able to help you where we really do appreciate the tip we do our best to try to keep as much of our content as free as possible about 99 of it is free um and that's great right because we're here to help human beings um and so now uh pin pin valavan is saying love you Dr K I've been struggling mentally and really wanted to say thank you and appreciate you for all you do thank you and thank you for being a member of the community we really appreciate it so you know we're gonna we're gonna do what we can um we're gonna try to help you all and uh yeah so I I feel like this is a very exciting day for me because I spend a lot of time on YouTube and I I feel like there's a whole pile of y'all that we don't ever get to interact with so we've decided that it's it it's that's got to change right so y'all are everywhere on the internet and we're gonna go to different places and hopefully if we're lucky in in 2023 we'll also go to places physically and what we're going to meet y'all we're going to hang out we're going to talk about stuff we're going to understand our mental health a little bit better we're going to understand the challenges that we Face we're going to understand why life is so hard and we're going to try to figure out what we can do it to make it easier that is what we're all about he understand yourself maybe grow a little bit a bit maybe have some memes have some fun you know that's that's great so um is the platform switch permanent I don't think so or if it is it's news to me this is just because so so here's the thing to understand about our relationship with platforms so we love basically all the platforms we're not here to succeed on a particular platform we're here to try to help people with their mental health and so naturally what that means is okay how are the ways that we can reach the people who are struggling how are we what are the ways that we can reach people who like aren't getting help elsewhere and so that's really what our mission is aligned towards so that's what ultimately determines like who we collaborate with and who we don't um and it's just whether we can help people using a particular platform and if the answer is yes we're there if the answer is no then we're not there and it's not just so I know everyone's kind of thinking about oh like twitch and YouTube and whatnot but it's it's way more than that right so it's the same reason why we collaborate with the office of the Surgeon General the United States and it's the same reason we collaborate with the United Nations it's like anyone Who's down to try to help it's the same reason we also work with video game companies right sometimes parents get super confused because they're like hey aren't you supposed to help people with video game addiction you're like damn right I'm gonna help people with video game addiction they're like why do you talk to video game companies because oftentimes I know it's insane and it's hard to believe but sometimes people at video game companies care about gamers they're not actually trying to destroy your life people make games because they love games and like they're like I want to make a really cool game and I I've seen this I'm really surprised but you know I've seen this that a lot of you know a lot of like gaming companies are all for reducing toxicity making things like more open and acceptable and like making games more fun they don't want to ruin your life actually what they want to do is they want to make sure that you are successful therefore you have more money therefore you can spend more things you can engage in more DLC purchases and microtransactions it's wild so today you know okay so I'm going to talk to y'all let's talk real quick about um uh so we're going to talk about so I want to talk about what we're talking about today all right so we um streamed on a platform that shall not be named two days ago and um it was somewhat of a I don't know what the right word is like this may be arrogant for me to say but kind of like explosive um stream in some ways and we talked a little bit about non-consensual pornography and I've been reading all the Reddit comments on our subreddit which by the way are fantastic I'd love to spend half an hour talking about them but this is really great so first of all I'm really like optimistic about this because people are talking in a way that is like non-toxic sometimes things that people can say can be hurtful or triggering for other people but generally speaking people are like on our subredditer like hey I don't understand how this can be so painful I have trouble empathizing with it which is totally fair right there's a huge difference between someone shouldn't feel that way and I have difficulty empathizing with them and I don't see what the big deal is we're not saying that it isn't a big deal we're saying I don't understand and so later we had a conversation with sweet Anita who is epic awesome intelligent articulate insightful and um so so Anita made a couple of statements that really confused me she's like when I when I turn someone down I'm not rejecting them like if a man expresses interest in me and I turn them out I'm not rejecting them I don't even know them I can't reject them and then I kind of did a double take and then what happened is we were in a meeting because we sometimes talk about like at 8G like okay how do we need to try to help the internet today and so it's a really interesting meeting because there are men in the meeting and women in the meeting and like we did not understand or see eye to eye so some some people like you know one woman in in one meeting was like I don't understand what the big deal is with the rejection like what's the big deal and all the men were like what do you mean what's the big deal and so I realized I don't know quite what's going on but there's some kind of disconnect between how rejected men feel and what the perception of rejection is by women and there's all kinds of disconnects so we're not just focused on this there's like all kinds of other disconnects that we want to eventually get to so another big one is sort of like this dichotomy between give me a chance and I can't trust men right so a lot of men will get upset because they'll say like oh I never you never gave me a chance which sometimes they're just wrong and they've actually been given a chance they just don't realize it and not everyone is entitled for a Chance At Romance right like if you're walking down the street it's not like every person that passes you is entitled to go on a date with you like every like man woman you know homeless person police officer grandma like they're not all entitled for a chance for you to fall in love with them so so there's a lot of stuff that's going on and I'm convinced that actually these things can be improved like I think we can solve this like I'm actually optimistic for the first time that I've been in a very long time and and the reason is because we're like actually talking so the problem is that the internet is a place where it does not uh support like nuanced conversation and understanding the internet is reactionary right so I'm gonna like evoke some feeling in you you're gonna tweet at me that's gonna evoke some feeling in me and I'm gonna Tweet back at you and we're gonna restrict our discussion to like 160 characters right that's what Twitter was based on and I'm not saying that Twitter is a bad platform it's a great platform for particular things but having nuanced discussions on Twitter is not what floats to the top and that's a big problem that we've got because it's all about what floats to the top and someone said we love you at YouTube here I don't know if you mean if you are a participator at YouTube or your employer employee YouTube but either way benfu we really appreciate it So today we're just gonna talk to people okay um about rejection and we're gonna try to understand like what's going on with like why men feel so rejected and the reason we're going to focus on this it's not that manner actually we don't know actually are men actually as rejected as they feel because it's oftentimes the experience of women that I'm not rejecting them as hard right I'm not trying to use my super alt smash on them I'm gonna tap the a button to like you know just just a tiny little uh it's a poke it's not a critical hit and then the experience of some men is like ah I've been critically hit it's like we're watching soccer matches where where like oh like someone bumped me and now I'm gonna jump into a backflip and I'm I'm so hurt right um and uh you know so we gotta we gotta understand like what's going on with this discrepancy and I see that Mike's hero thanks to Dr K and Andrew Tate I've been able to resolve my issues well I am really really happy so curious what the resolution has been right so I'm really curious if you listen to Dr K and Andrew Tate how does that what resolution do you come to and um yeah fascinating fascinating right um okay so your uh last plus first is saying your content helped me process the end of a four-year relationship at a rate I never thought would be possible I'm proud of myself I have your your channel thank you you're very welcome last plus first also um give yourself some credit right so I think here's here's what I think a lot a lot of people think that we are wise and very knowledgeable and that's sort of true but here's why we exist so I have no doubt in my mind well this is really messing up the hair I have no doubt in my mind that y'all will figure this stuff out on your own right so if we don't have these conversations about why men feel so rejected like eventually someone will figure out you will even figure out if you're a man you will figure it out if you're a woman you'll figure out if you're non-binary we'll figure it out the question is how quickly do you want to figure it out right and what we what I realized what we really are is like we want y'all to learn this stuff like today so that it doesn't take you three years to figure it out and in that time span your life will improve because now you understand it right that's what we're really about so I was talking to one of our employees Sometimes some time ago and they were saying you know what what the real advantage of you is is not that you know a lot it's that you made a lot of mistakes and so I I kind of hit every branch on the way down like I'm a certified Crystal healer and the Reiki practitioner right so I like spend some time learning weird stuff in India and like that was super cool and then I was like you know what maybe I should become a doctor like a medical doctor and maybe I should learn medicine and I learned a lot of great stuff in India that I still apply today that's like kind of like weird and esoteric and not scientific but here's the thing even amongst the non-scientific things there's the real BS and then there's the stuff that even though it's not scientific seems to have a lot of value um Akshay is saying hey thanks for the 100 rupiah donation [Music] been watching you for two years now I'm working my dream job right now because of you thank you for all you've done uh for all of us keep up the great work we will Akshay and props to you for working your dream job I'm glad I was able to help you but like I think you had something to do with it so let's hop in with callers and let's try to figure out so what do y'all think chat should we understand um should we understand what's going on like why men feel so rejected what do y'all think Akshay Kumar Crystal healing you can heal crystals yes I'm able to cast healing spells that work on inanimate objects only is it true that maois or effective for rejection sensitivity what on Earth what a fascinating question I will look into that Dennis bolognos what a cool question okay hello my friend how are you oh uh muted hold on one second can you count to 10 for me one two three thank you so much welcome and what do you go by my friend like am I Luna Luna yeah it's so awesome to hear you smile service Smiley but thank you it's not hey I'll take it right better than tears um so so tell me Luna so do you have any thoughts on why men feel so rejected nowadays um I think uh it has to do with them projecting an image of themselves that isn't entirely authentic which creates this sort of distorted environment in which both parties don't entirely know the other person well and of course they just get rejected a lot sadly okay so that sounds fascinating can you explain that or break it down a little bit more so you say they project an image of themselves so what do you mean by project an image of themselves um I've if I had to okay let me see I think we all would like to be a better version of ourselves both men and women alike sure and I think when we do that we tend to over exaggerate or maybe even lie about some parts of ourselves that we're insecure about and you don't really get to know the other person because of it and I feel like people can feel that you're not entirely honest so it hurts more because of that that's so interesting so so that's really helpful Luna so let me just see if I understand you so what you're kind of saying is okay so men project an image of themselves it's a better version of themselves maybe even they like lie a little bit and then what happens um well I think people can pick up on them not being entirely honest about it okay so the BS meter goes off right yeah and then what happens um well then it just becomes really uncomfortable to talk to someone who isn't being entirely honest okay um yeah okay so so then what happened so can I ask you a little bit about if you're speaking from personal experience I am yes yeah so can you if you feel comfortable right if you don't want to go to into details you don't have to but I'm so curious about if you could share like what because I think there's a there are a lot of men out there that are listening right now I imagine a lot of women will resonate with your experience but I think it would be very illustrative and helpful to men if they could hear more about like an example do you feel comfortable sharing something like that yes I do story time let's go thank you I mean it's obviously something I've done myself I think this is something that everyone does at some point um thank you for adding that nuance of course of course I I like I just want to reiterate that women and men have separate issues at different levels of nuance and it's hard to say who is suffering more you can't really measure suffering so anything I'm saying I am not being like oh this is true or this is 100 years not at all I I honestly really appreciate that I think this kind of discussion needs that sort of nuance but I'd love to hear what your actual experience like was with you know yes um so in high school which was I think like uh four year five four or five years ago I don't really remember um I was beginning to experiment with relationships and I met someone who seemed like he was very confident and he seemed to be interested in almost everything I liked um stuff like anime and fanfiction stuff like that oh my goodness you're only embarrassed about he was like oh yeah I like that like yeah because if you're interested in anime and fan fiction I imagine you get judged harshly for that a lot uh in high school yeah I mean so sometimes okay so Along Comes This dude who loves anime and fan fiction yeah and he found it hard to find an answer so he just picked something like Naruto and I was like oh cool like I don't know how to put it it's just when we finally got into a relationship after like months of talking and socializing he fessed up and he was like okay so I don't actually like fan fiction I think it's kind of weird and I was like wow yeah I was like damn man you didn't have to lie about it and how how did it feel for you for him to fake liking fan fiction I I don't like I've been talking to him about fan fiction a lot something I was genuinely embarrassed by in high school which is why I didn't talk about it very much and I talked to him maybe like hours about it and he seemed so interested and I thought oh my God I found someone who isn't judging me for it and then once down the line he just said I think it's weird and I'm like yeah but oh my God I I can imagine so what what kind of felt worse the lying or the judgment I think I don't know they're both equally important okay um okay fair but I think the judgments from someone who listened to me talk about it a lot sure so so yeah I see what you mean it's not just I mean like maybe it would have been okay if they judged you a little bit and were honest about it or it would have been okay if they were it's the two together the fact that they kind of misled you and so then I I'm did you break up with them or what happened um so that that was around the time I got in therapy and uh it was It was kind of intensive therapy and my therapist kind of guided me throughout everything and at some point I just realized I don't actually know my boyfriend very well as I thought I did okay and he's not really making me feel like a better person because now it feels uncomfortable talking about my interest to him because if he's capable of lying about stuff like that in order to in that moment it felt like it was he he was doing it in order to get closer to me I didn't feel very safe in the relationship so yeah yeah absolutely and but so so but is it clear that he felt very rejected by what you did oh yeah how how did that manifest when you say oh yeah that sounds it was bad how so well we had this friend group um and it was mostly his friend group and when I broke up with him I think it was in like during summer break so when summer break was over I obviously couldn't be in his friend group anymore um and then apparently he was gossiping to his to the friend group about our relationship and I don't think he meant anything bad by it per se but I feel like he felt really rejected I don't know if it counts in this context but no yeah sure so it's just something about the way that he was talking about you you kind of inferred that he felt rejected yeah and and but so did he okay that makes a lot of sense um I mean but but just just to clarify so it sounds like you guys didn't have much contact after that and you sort of heard yeah okay um it was I don't know he just seemed vindictive for a while and what what did that how did that vindictiveness manifest I just kept hearing from like this one person in the friend group that he was saying stuff about our relationship without ever really going into it and that was very confusing for me at the time and I contemplated talking to him about it but the relationship wasn't that great uh so what kind of stuff was he saying about the relationship no exactly I don't remember it yeah it sounds like it was four or five years ago so it makes sense yeah so so it sounds like he was kind of like not going into too much detail but there was definitely I mean because if this friend kept telling you about it there must have been some kind of you know emotional energy behind your ex-boyfriend's statements yeah okay so just to make sure I kind of understand what you're saying so like if I can try to summarize for a second is there anything else you want to add by the way I don't know if I gave the right example here and starting to regret telling the story what makes you regret telling the story I mean it's just so embarrassing and it's I think it's such a high school level stuff you know yeah I mean so I I totally understand if I can say this and you got to set me straight okay Luna the story the story is a touch cringe be honest like that's what high school is about so like here's the problem is we judge people for being cringe like in high school cringes the norm like is it cringe sure but here's the problem there's nothing wrong with cringe like how else are we supposed to learn this stuff like we're gonna you know it's like when I install a new video game and I go into matchmaking I get crushed and it's kind of cringe and like I I literally I I literally one time had this girl give me my number and I didn't even understand what she was doing and I made her cry because it was it was awful it like the cringe just and it like cringe is a normal part of human development yeah that's true and and so I'm really glad you added that you shared this example because I think what it's going to do is hopefully people out there who are still in high school and going through stuff like this hopefully one of them hears your story and you're kind of like tanking it for us right because you're exposing yourself to the cringe I mean you're you're sharing the cringe and then hopefully other people out there honestly like I believe this I believe you're doing good in the world and I also think that your your story is good because I think that there's a lot of questions there right so this is the experience of a woman who who experience some amount of you know like dudes getting really really upset and you shared your perspective and I think you also did a fantastic job of kind of highlighting that when we start meeting with someone we kind of like fake ourselves a little bit we pump ourselves up a little bit we pretend to be something that we're not to get closer to someone it's men do it women do it you know yeah yeah and and so then we sometimes maybe opening ourselves up for some amount of rejection because we're not really authentically expressing Who We Are yeah can I ask you uh one more question sure so let's say I'm a dude who authentically feels like I'm a waste of space I'm not going anywhere in life I've got nothing going for me that's not attractive right that's not no so how would you let's say that I'm lonely and I'm attracted to someone but my experience of my authentic self is not very positive what do you think I should do honestly I've personally been there as well cool that was like great I mean not great that you've been there but you know but but I'd love to hear when you say you've been there that implies you're not there now maybe after this call you'll slide back a little bit okay but seriously I'd love to hear how did you how did you come out of that this sounds ironic but I've accepted the cringe with specific people um I like I know my interests aren't always mainstream and I ramble a lot and I'm not very good at socializing um stuff like that and one day I just went well I like things and I can't be the only one who likes them and people like other people who have passion for something so I might as well really like it and really be honest about it um and that's that's sort of how I met my current boyfriends who encouraged me to ramble about stuff without lying about liking fanfiction or not and like this like um I'm a really awkward person I think almost everyone has realized it by now I'm really awkward um but he tells me to just be awkward and be weird because at least that way your true to yourself and sure it might not apply to everyone but I think if you just find parts of yourself that you just like a little bit you might as well share it um obviously not push it down people's faces don't just go oh I love fanfiction just be like okay let me read you my fan fiction you're sitting next to me on an eight-hour flight gets trapped him here we go let's do that example sitting in my uni cafeteria and just like suddenly I went okay but I don't agree with the end ship from Avatar The Last Airbender and my classmates were like what the hell are you talking about so I went in through this 20 minute rant about how I don't believe Katara and Ang were meant to be together and then this girl from another table is like yeah I agree and sometimes I still talk to her now okay so Luna I don't think you're awkward at all I think you're a great person until you didn't give us a spoiler warning sorry should we refer to serious but not for like 10 years now I know that's fair yeah I'm yeah okay fair enough so so I'm I'm kind of hearing that that maybe so this is actually really interesting because so if someone doesn't believe that if someone thinks of themselves in a very low way I'm almost like hearing that I'm trying to think about how to say this because this actually sounds so that self-acceptance makes you realize that you may be judging yourself based on a standard of like other people and so instead of living up to their standard which is what a lot of people try to do when they feel pathetic right like I have to be a better human being I have to live up to the standard I mean I don't think this is really accurate but in a way you have to adjust the standard to you it's not lowering your standard I think it's really just picking a different direction and saying actually this is who I am and that's okay other people don't have to like it there's a lot of like self-acceptance in there which is you know how you started to develop confidence and it sounds like it's working out well for you yeah it's I'm pretty sure you've heard of it but it's this thing called radical acceptance obviously totally different meaning but like just people will like you there's eight billion people in the world and if you have to um how to put this it you shouldn't be ashamed of the things that you like when you talk about them it's awkward and sometimes people will find it weird and maybe even some people will be creeped out by it but just like that girl on the other side of the table being like yeah I agree you know there's people out there who are like that and I don't know it's oh man okay that makes a lot of sense so I'm glad yeah I think that that makes a lot of sense and and so it sounds like you're doing a little bit better radical acceptance has helped you a lot and um it sounds like you're you sound happy Luna I am I am really happy yes yeah thank you so much for sharing your perspective of course thank you for having me here take care you too alrighty hello hello welcome my friend hello can you tell me um what you go by or how you'd like to be addressed I mean my name is Elena Elena nice to meet you Elena welcome nice to meet you too um and can you tell me a little bit about why you think men feel so rejected nowadays sure um I've been listening to the stream so uh I was just I thought about it um and honestly I think maybe they put women on a pedestal a little bit too much what do you mean by that so um how do I say this so like here's kind of my beef um I was single until I was 26. and that's when I got my very first boyfriend though it's really interesting to me because a lot of a lot of the dialogue is about being single for a really long time and like I relate to that but I'm also a woman right so sorry because a lot of people a lot of people you need to remember to breathe a lot of people don't realize that women can be single too and be lonely you know so I think that's part of it I think so like in my experience I also had a lot of insecurities and even when people hit on me I never even realized it until like years later because at the time I had such like low self-worth that I thought they were joking um so it's just to me it's interesting because I think a lot of the rejections might just be like misunderstandings how so and obviously like hmm oh I okay yeah I made okay maybe this is what you meant so like people are feeling rejected but you didn't like intentionally reject them you were just oblivious is that what you mean sorry that is what I meant okay yeah that's interesting yeah so this is just kind of like my angle on it um because I've had a lot of experiences I guess what I'll do is I'll just go into story mode please um I did have one experience uh at a party one time and like for example I was wearing a pink wig for some reason I don't even know I was in film school so there's just random crap around um and some guy came up to me and he started hitting on me but all he was talking about was the pink wig so like in my mind I was like wow this wig is really attractive and like it was nothing about me you know what I mean hmm so then I went to talk to one of my guy friends and I like was laughing and like any time he was like let's hang out I'd be like um and then I talked to one of my other guy friends which was interesting he was like you really like turned that guy down and I was like what and in his mind it was a rejection but in my mind I thought the entire situation was a joke and you were the butt of the joke now I was the joke yeah I think like and so this is just kind of like one example um I hope I'm making sense um well can I tell you what I heard and then you tell me if you're making sense okay so what I'm hearing is that you have your own internal environment and that when a man approaches you and like does things like wants to ask you if you want to hang out and it compliments an article of clothing I don't know if wig counts that you're wearing in his mind this is the way that you ask a girl out but in your mind you're like this is crazy there's no way that someone would ever ask me out or they're making fun of me or they must really like wigs and and so they're yeah you know so they're like sending a signal that that you're not receiving and so then I I think it kind of makes sense because in your mind you're not like rejecting this person like if you had even understood that they were asking you out you may have even said yes you just didn't understand that and they're coming away with like you not saying yes so they kind of feel rejected because they kind of shot their shot yeah and I think that's also part of the reason why I say like the the pedestal thing because it's kind of like for some reason they think the woman's gonna understand them from the get-go and understand the situation when really it doesn't it doesn't like that doesn't mean that we do understand so I see so so when you say like put women on a pedestal I'm not hearing you kind of say like oh women are like perfect and deserve to be whatever it's just like that it's not like women are telepathic yeah it's kind of like they're just different from us when they're not different from us maybe that's really what it is what do you mean by that sorry I was talking for the men for point of view for some reason it's kind of like like women are their own thing women are going to do this or they're going to do that when truthfully like everyone is just a person and it's just one of those situations where maybe a woman will accept your compliments but maybe another person won't and that's just completely individualized I see okay so so it's kind of they're just sort of assumptions about uh what I'm kind of hearing you say is that men need to really tailor their approaches to a woman's communication Style yeah I mean that's I tailored approach just in general sure with humans the best bet yeah with humans so quick question Elena just just now now that you're in a different place so in my mind and maybe this is because I'm a dude so I'd love to get to the if there is a discrepancy here if I'm talking to a girl I compliment her clothing and then I ask her if she wants to hang out to me that's sort of like that's asking someone out like that's not you know being kind of beating around the bush is that do you think that that's a fair assessment or or do you think that it really needs to be more explicit like that's kind of asking someone out right like that is that is kind of asking someone out I get that I think a lot of that even what another scenario I was thinking of was often like at a bar like if you're like you want to hang out later at the bar then it might totally depend on like what I'm doing that day um because I could be there with like friends that I've never seen in a long time and like maybe in the situation it may feel a rejection because I'm like you know I don't like I don't have time for that right now but truthfully it's like in my mind I'm not necessarily rejecting you or your offer it's just I literally don't have the time to hang out right now like I'm here for other things and so in in that kind of situation what would you say what I what I would say um interesting totally that one defense I guess they would depend partially if I find them interesting maybe what I do is um I might say maybe later like okay um I don't know because so like I don't think I'd ever just randomly give somebody my number okay um but if they gave me their number and was like text me later if you want to hang out then maybe I'm more inclined to text them later if I am interested I see okay because I I I kind of see what I think what you're saying Elena makes a ton of ton of sense so on the one hand you know for men to understand that like y'all aren't omniscient or telepathic I I do it's it's kind of it helps me to understand a little bit that in retrospect like you know if you were in a more confident place and a little bit less insecure you would have recognized that someone was asking you out but it's not I think that there's a large gray area there right in terms of like some like because the person the dude could have been more explicit or you know the person who's being asked out could be less insecure in either of those works is that fair yeah and then the other thing is that I I think a lot of this may depend on what you say and also how people interpret the rejection which I think there's a balance of as well because I think you make a really good point that sometimes the reason that if someone if a person a asks out person B men women whatever and person B says not right now or it's not that you know like if if people are clear that like oh it's not it doesn't that has nothing to do with you it's like I'm not looking for a relationship right now and I've seen a lot of people who will take that very personally yeah and I think like I've seen that a lot too and I know a lot of women who like literally just don't want a relationship and it's hard because it's not that we don't feel guilty sometimes too and it's not that we don't understand that it's nice to have someone care about us but it's just maybe we just got out of a bad relationship or maybe there's just like we've got families and we've got friends and sometimes there's just a lot going on that we don't have like the resources to take on a relationship as well yeah makes a lot of sense and and do you think that um of the people that you know you said a lot of women you know are not just looking for a relationship do they kind of articulate that point and men still take it personally or what do you think happens there well it's a mixed bag honestly it's a mixed bag I've had guys take rejection really well and I've had guys take um what I didn't even think was a rejection um you know as a rejection basically can you get the like no no I didn't cut out I interrupted you and I stopped talking so I apologize but um because you're you're I just felt bad for interrupting you but what I was really curious about is you you've had guys who take it well and guys who take it poorly I'd love to I love it if you could pay to paint a picture of that if you feel comfortable doing that and if it comes to memory um so there's one situation that I can think of I was at a bar and a guy offered to buy me a drink um and I said no because I was there with some friends and I just like I wasn't interested in just I feel like if someone's gonna buy you a drink you kind of are indebted to talk to with them for a little while sure um so I just I was kind of like like I know I'm not I'm not here for that and then he got very pushy and he was like no I really want to give you a drink like no why why aren't you letting me buy you a drink all I'm doing is trying to offer you a drink and it was just like uh like the pushiness came off as really aggressive and like that was unattractive um so then after that whenever people offered me a drink I would just be like yeah you know what buy me a drink and then I would just walk away and like that's rude and it might be seen as rejection but like from my point of view I had that one experience that was kind of like if you're gonna offer me a drink that's on you um so that was kind of like taking your rejection not well um and then I have had like situations um I was seeing somebody off and on it was weird situation but um long story short I just started seeing someone else seriously and I just he was like hey do you want to hang out and I literally just told him I was like I'm seeing somebody seriously um this isn't like happening anymore and he was like cool and then that was it cool oh yeah Elena absolutely enlightening I I also I mean huh what did you say sorry yeah I said sorry why uh because I'm Canadian and I think that's just our punctuation sometimes oh okay no I was like this is absolutely enlightening you're like sorry and I was like wait were you trying to deceit like I'm gonna be um but yeah so I I also really like the insight into how you so it sounds like there used to be an Elena who was like I understand that if someone buys me a drink there's a reciprocity that they're they're not just buying me a drink and it's like here take this free beverage and go live your life and I shall go live my life and we shall never part ways right yeah and and so you acknowledge that like when someone buys you a drink there's like this unspoken sort of like social rule that like oh like if you accept the drink like that's an offer of it's an expression of Interest which you either accept or reject and then what happens is like you have one experience or maybe more than one we just heard one where someone's like super pushy and then you've like learned or adapted that what I'm gonna do is just take the drink and walk away if I'm not interested in the person like I can't be having this conversation with every person tries to buy me a drink you almost learn like an Adaptive strategy which is like they're pushy dudes out there and and that's just you've adapted to the environment yeah and honestly like I feel bad because I'm sure there's lots of people that aren't pushy at all um and they might be the ones that feel as though they're losing out yeah um but it makes you feel better being pushy is not helping um yeah so I mean I think that's that it's it's really I personally learned a lot from that because I think that part of the problem that I think a lot of trouble uh one of the things that I think a lot of men have trouble understanding is that a woman has to build her social strategies not based on you know you protect against the worst case scenario usually you don't plan for the average scenario if that kind of makes sense sorry can you repeat that yeah so like like so so for example when when you know when you're when someone offers you a drink at the bar your behavior is going to be waste based on the worst case scenario not the average scenario yeah that's that's fair and and I think that's something that you know that's like more than fair honestly yeah and I think that that's something that gets lost and a lot of men feel unfairly judged which in a sense they are because but but it's it's kind of like a adaptation right because if you start if you start saying no how many pushy dudes are you gonna piss off and pissing off a pushy dude hurts more costs more than um taking advantage of a nice guy I'm trying to figure out a more compassionate way to say that but I couldn't find the words because I think that paints does that paint me badly those words I think taking advantage I think paints you in a bad light but I I mean I just couldn't find a better word I don't I don't think you're taking advantage of people on purpose I think it's just pissing off pushy dudes costs more than mildly pissing off nice people well maybe that's a better way to put it yeah well and like I guess one of those things well does something happen are you still there yeah I'm here hello okay sorry I just heard beep um yeah no will pissing off a pushy dude also puts you in more dangerous situations and that's when you have to tell your girlfriends that you're watching out for this one guy and make sure that you're not alone together and it's just like you know it's a sad reality but a lot of us are put in dangerous situations and it's like on media and stuff like that and it's something that we have to be considerate of um and then you might be a nice guy and you might come up to us and be like you know I'm a nice guy I'm not going to do that to you but like thank you for bringing it up I wasn't thinking about it and now I don't trust you you know like it's a lose-lose situation and I do feel bad because I feel like a lot of guys are rejected and the truth is they probably are there is a ton of rejection I think there's a lot of rejection for both genders um maybe you guys feel more pressured to ask people out more often and that's why they also feel as though they're getting rejected more often um but it's just it's hard because like we have to navigate both safety and interest and it's just like and then honestly sometimes we don't even want to yeah right sometimes we're literally at the bar celebrating a friend's birthday and like we don't even care I'm with you I think that makes a lot of sense I I really love this sentence that you used which is we have to navigate safety and interest and most of the men that I've talked to and and hopefully we'll talk to men pretty soon but um I think that they don't quite have that same experience of like what two variables are they navigating I don't think safety is a big part of their equation in in this situation thank you very much Elena anything else you want to add no I'm good awesome honestly thank you from the bottom of my heart for sharing your experiences and and your take on this situation I hope it'll help people yeah I hope it's helpful too let's go hello oh hello oh okay Thanks Elena I know sorry I don't know how to hang up one second [Laughter] hi where do you go about my friend um You can call me Tommy all right Tommy so Tommy tell me a little bit uh about why men feel more rejected so basically a lot of this is just from personal like anecdotal experience but um when I speak to you know my female friends they seem to have a lot of options you know they have a lot of men that are interested in them um if you look on you know if they sometimes you know if you look on their Tinder you know I don't know if you're just having fun like oh let's see your Tinder they've got hundreds and hundreds of matches hundreds of likes um and that's pretty much you know every all of my female friends you know regardless of like I don't know their social status or how good looking they are or whatever whereas if you look at you know my male friends or talk to my male friends about like their dating lives you know they don't really seem to have any options if you look at their tinders you know they're getting like five likes or you know matches or some of them that some of them are getting like nothing at all um so I think a big part of it is is essentially that is like women seem to have a lot of options for some reason and men don't really seem to have many in comparison so how does that relate to feeling rejected or getting rejected so basically I think of it like um so I this is I don't know if this example is going to make any sense but um so I'm I really like film I really like movies and I watch a lot of films I watch a lot of movies um and kind of as a result of that if I watch Like an average movie it's kind of extremely boring to me because I'm thinking you know like oh you know I saw one last week that was like that was a nine out of 10 or a 10 out of 10 like why you know why would I bother with like this average movie you know I wouldn't even like I'm not even gonna bother watching it um where someone like my mum my mum doesn't watch like any movies any films so she's kind of satisfied with any like she can watch the most average film in the world and she will like it will it will blow her mind essentially I think it's a little bit similar in terms of like the average woman you know isn't gonna feel like she if she I don't know if she's talking to an average man she might feel like she can do better because she has a lot of options whereas like that average man it feels this is just from my personal experience it feels a little like desperate like talking to women you know because you're thinking or I'm thinking shall I say you know she's talking to me for now but you know she'll be talking to other people and you know some of them they're probably better lacking than me or they've got more money than me or you know whatever it is so you kind of feel like you're in a precarious position and you end up feeling like rejected a lot because you know they'll just like move on to what they perceive to be like a better option after a while okay so I think that I can understand a lot of what you're saying and some of it confuses me so let me start with this so one thing that I'm kind of noticing is that if I've got a hundred options yeah and if someone else has one option one rejection is worth a lot more right so if I get rejected by one person and I've got 99 people other options it's like not a big deal exactly but if I've got one option so it's it's kind of like each rejection is worth so much more in terms of like the percentage of my chances yeah so so one rejection is like no big deal it's like a one percent hit who cares yeah whereas for some people that one rejection is all of their chances yes exactly yes um and and I'm noticing someone in chat just said and the other thing here is that when you've got that one match that also means that 99 people have already rejected you which is a great Point too when it comes to online dating right because you're getting rejected all the time the one thing that kind of confuses me and I don't fault you for feeling this way Tommy but I'm really glad you shared this is you're kind of saying okay if she's talking to me yeah eventually she's going to talk to someone who's got more money or better looking or things like that yeah and then that makes you feel rejected um well not in the moment that they're you know talking to you it's more you feel like you feel like you're in a precarious position you know you're like um oh God I can't mess this up I can't say the wrong thing because you know it like if you make one mistake it's over and then I end up feeling rejected again but but do things end and that's when you feel rejected um yeah I mean I guess I guess you could say in a set oh go on yeah because I mean what I'm almost hearing is like you know so human beings will prepare themselves for pain so it's like if I'm gonna go get a shot at the doctor like I know it's gonna hurt I know it's gonna hurt I know it's gonna hurt and I kind of like mentally prepare myself for it I'm wondering if like part of the preparation for rejection is to start like start the process now because we know it's coming yes I would say so yes so here's here's one thing that highly concerns me is that first of all maybe the reason so this could become a self-fulfilling prophecy because if you're talking to someone who's interested in you and you start losing confidence because of the Specter of someone better than you yeah that that lack of confidence or even the lack of faith in the other person may facilitate them picking someone else yes I completely agree um although I would say to not feel to to basically I feel like to not let that get if you've been rejected you know like we were saying before you know you don't have a lot of options and then you get you get rejected by one person then another then another I do agree that then it becomes if you start identifying with like oh I'm like the person that gets rejected it's gonna it's gonna make it more difficult because then you're I identifying with being the rejected one but at the same time if you do get rejected a lot it is quite I feel like you have to have quite a you know High Constitution to like not let that so yeah 100 so so I want to be clear with what I'm saying you essentially like being when someone's talking to you and you're afraid that you're eventually going to get rejected results in low self-confidence that low self-confidence then actually increases your likelihood of rejection yeah and so it becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy now a lot of people who are listening to this may think ah therefore the problem is that the man loses confidence which is the root of the problem because you are expecting rejection when you really shouldn't be expecting rejection whereas if people think oh the problem is that the man should be more confident I don't think that's fair to say because there's a reason why you started reject expecting rejection in the first place yeah right so there have been and I think you kind of alluded to that is that this is like a pattern at which point once again we start adapting to our experiences and people don't people who are I mean this sounds kind of weird but like I don't think people realize people are like how do I gain confidence how do I gain confidence you don't gain confidence confidence is actually the default state so if you look at like a one-year-old or a two-year-old or a three-year-old or a five-year-old yeah a normal five-year-old will be confident confidence is something that is taken away from people through experience yeah it's not something that you can ever gain it's only something that you can lose and so if there are men out there who are like oh like this is doomed to failure and they're better people out there there's some reason they form that conclusion they're not just like pulling that conclusion out of their ass yeah I completely agree um so I don't actually know why you might know more about this than I do um I don't know why it feels like that or it seems like you know women have more options than men because you know there's about the same amount of women as there are to men so I don't know what do you think about that like why or do you even agree with me I don't know if you agree with me in terms of like you think women on average have more options than men are so it's a good question so um let's just think through a couple things so a lot of times people like yourself will make assumptions that since there's the same number of men and women yeah um shouldn't it mean that people kind of get rejected the same amount because we kind of end up generally speaking like in monogamous relationships that's not necessarily the case so like let me just give you an example of like some issues of gender Dynamics a lot of women will believe that there are a lot of men out there who are [ __ ] so so let's assume that there are 10 men out there one is an [ __ ] and nine are decent human beings and if you ask women what percentage of men are [ __ ] they may say 50 percent and so then you start to wonder about that and then you if you actually dig into it this is sort of what I discovered is that the one [ __ ] is mean to one person gets dumped and then moves on to the second and moves on to the third moves on to the fourth moves on to the fifth moves on to the sixth moves under the seventh so the one [ __ ] gets around a lot more yeah so they're they're over represented in the sample which gives people and and then dudes are confused because we're like wait like 90 of us are decent human beings and then women will say like 50 of the people I've dated are [ __ ] that's because the [ __ ] like don't aren't able to sustain a relationship and they keep bouncing around and frequently the adaptation of the [ __ ] is to lure people into a false relationship right so then they like talk a big game and then don't deliver it so I think there are all kinds of reasons why a 50 50 ratio doesn't have to result in like a 50 50 experience okay so you're saying like you know if you're a nice I don't know just like a nice normal person you're more likely to be in a healthy relationship where you're going to be with like one person for like a longer amount of time so then you're not going from like person to person like an [ __ ] would like yeah so yeah and there's a colloquial sense of this which I imagine is somewhat true although it's worthwhile and now I'm gonna look at the research but you know there's this idea that the good ones get taken yeah and so what happens is like since the good ones are pairing off and like leaving the pool like what are you left with yeah and so yeah so you know if if we say 50 of humans or let's say 90 of humans are decent and then out of those 90 that are decent if 45 of them are pairing up and leaving the pool that means that out of the 55 percent are are left you know now suddenly we've gone from 10 [ __ ] to 20 [ __ ] in the pool and it could be worse right so like it could be that 75 percent of people meet up and are kind of like out of the pool mm-hmm and then yeah so I think that's just I I don't really know though but it's worth thinking about the other thing that kind of confuses me though is it seems that men and women are both having difficulty finding relationships more so now so I I don't I don't think that nice ones get taken or if something is changing that I think that used to be more true than it is now yeah I feel like so I say women have more options in general but it feels like they this is mostly anecdotal but um you know a lot of the women I talk to they will it's like they will see quite a lot of people you know but it won't it will be things that don't last very long um you know yeah they won't be I don't know that many people I get I don't know about you you're obviously in a different situation to me but I know so many people that just like kind of bounce around from relationship to relationship I don't know that many people who have like been with one person for a long amount of time and like they're do you know what I mean yeah no I'm I'm with you so so my experience is the exact opposite so I don't know a single person in my Social Circle who bounces around that was okay you know so like once you move out to The Burbs with your family and you go to the playground and you go to your kids whatever you're surrounded by other people that have been in largely stable relationships for like 10 years yeah yeah I would say yeah it probably depends on like you know I feel like class is an issue as well so for example um I'm I'm from a very working class area um and my my parents you know have been together since I was born and they're still together um I don't think I have a single friend whose parents are like together they're almost they're almost all separated um so then I feel like you know that probably looks like the Next Generation Um so so just to kind of summarize Tommy I'm hearing you kind of say that here are the kind of takeaways I have from our conversation if you have more to add please please do but uh the first is that one thing I'm really taking away is that one rejection is percentage-wise way worse for dudes yes because you don't have yeah and so maybe one reason that they feel more rejected is because like we don't have if you're a dude you don't have like tons of options like you've got one option maybe two maybe three and so it's like each one each one matters a lot more yeah it's like a a millionaire losing you know 100 pounds versus like a poor person losing a hundred pounds sure it's like it's the same amount of money but it's a lot worse for yeah and and then I'm I'm also hearing that that you'll kind of acknowledge that there's some weird like the process of rejection actually starts early and maybe even before you get rejected yeah and and which makes you more likely to get rejected right so there could be some amount of like lack of confidence which then is not attractive and and results in someone else kind of pursuing or you know getting attracted to someone else or and I've seen this where sometimes men will not just men but just people who lack confidence will actually do a lot of stuff to drive their Partners away yes where they'll start to say oh you're gonna find someone better than me and then the person is like no I won't why are you saying like no I'm like I'm with you because I want to be with you no you're going to find someone better no you're gonna find someone better and then what they actually do is they just piss the other person off yeah and then they're like oh my God yeah I told you so I knew it I knew it all along but but I think the important thing to acknowledge there is that people who start to fear that and start to believe that believe it for probably a quote unquote good reason I don't think that you know it's yeah they weren't bomb thinking that yeah and then then I think that there's the last kind of point is you asked me a question about you know why is it that men have fewer options than women which you're acknowledging is anecdotal in your experience and based on the Tinder profiles that you've browsed through from your Social Circle which is yeah fair I think it's it's good data we just have to understand what the caveats and shortcomings of the data are and that's a question that I don't know I'ma look into it for you though okay very nice I'll be expecting a video yeah so that's what we're I think there are a lot of good questions here that I just gotta you know compost all this stuff and then we're gonna try to do some research and we're gonna try to give you all some answers yeah any any other thoughts or questions before we wrap up Tommy um if well if you're going to do a bit of research into it um there's um this this study that gets like thrown around a lot that I've heard um is kind of how men and women view attractiveness in each other and like the disparity between the two genders um I don't know the exact numbers but essentially women see the average man as ugly they only see like you know 20 of men as attractive whereas men see like 50 of women as attractive so I feel like that might factor into it as well yeah so that certainly factors into it but there's all kinds of stuff with that so I mean I I can try to toss out a couple of points that's not going to be synthesized okay but um so number one what people say they find attractive in a survey does not necessarily correlate with how people end up in relationships so a lot of people will see surveys like this and they'll say oh this is the truth this explains stuff so it's very different between asking a random person what do you find attractive and seeing what kind of people actually get together yeah so a simple example the best example of this is companies will do focus groups and they'll ask a bunch of people in a room they'll say here's a beautiful product it is a glass this glass that's made of It's Made of Glass it's clear it can store all kinds of liquids it's amazing you can use it to wash yourself you can use it to drink things you can use it to store things what do you think this glass is worth and people will say I think it's worth this much I would think and then the company will say do you think the glass is worth ten dollars and people will say yeah absolutely such an amazing glass it's absolutely worth ten dollars that's very different from hey here's a glass it costs ten dollars do you want to buy it yeah yeah and then focus group people like nah I don't want to buy it so this is something that we've got to be and I see this a lot where people cite statistics around dating they don't they miss this core point was that asking people what they find attractive is not the same as what determines whether you get into a relationship yeah second thing is that when women we say women find only 20 of people physically attractive there's also a different ranking for what is important mm-hmm for a man and a woman to engage in a relationship so in my sense of this the last time I looked at the research is that um physical attractiveness is less important of equality for the average woman in terms of how what they're looking for in a relationship yeah so even though women may find men less physically attractive than men find women that doesn't necessarily translate into only 20 because what happens is people say oh only it's the pretty 20 that they're the only ones that get a chance of the relationship that's an inappropriate conclusion from a piece of data yeah because all you need to do to really understand who women pick is walk around like go to a grocery store and just see like go to a school and look at the parents yeah I guarantee you that the majority of people who are out there having kids are average looking yeah it's not like you know everyone's like Genghis Khan with like 10 000 kids out there like they just you know most most children are the product of generally speaking like a monogamous relationship between average looking people yeah yeah I completely agree um I yeah there is this thing I I think it is an interesting disparity but I I completely agree with what you're sorry and I feel like I'm listening I was just gonna say there are a lot of fit it's very complicated isn't it the whole um you know the gender Dynamics in Dayton there's a lot of things that go into it like what we've been talking about like attractiveness or like you know class social status like there are a lot of things that you could look at in terms of why things are the way that they are yeah absolutely so just uh I'll be right so if people are curious like if you want to understand relationship research this book is great this bad boy is only 800 and 72 some odd pages but like people who talk like people who cite relationship statistics I oftentimes find that they don't really understand like what they're talking about so you got to take all that stuff with a grain of salt I started reading this book it's a mess it's like it's good but it's long and so we'll we'll synthesize all the stuff that you're saying Tommy I'm going to look at that book probably tomorrow and try to find answers to your questions and we will absolutely make a video about it yes I would love to see it you you probably know a lot more about it than I do so I'd be very interested to your thoughts I would say I know a different kind of thing than you do I wouldn't say I know more you have a better intellectual understanding than I do I think sure I'll take that you could read the Cambridge Handbook of personal relationships and then you will have a better intellectual understanding I'll get right on it 150 by tomorrow yeah yeah all right take care Tommy thank you so much thank you cheers bye seriously it's a good book the Cambridge Handbook of personal relationship it's a textbook so you got to watch out like this is great physiology and interpersonal relationships communication basic properties and their relevance to relationship research family relationships and depression violence and abuse and personal relationships romantic love commitment intimacy and personal relationship it's a great book a lot of good stuff in there hello hello what do you go my friend uh you can call me Joe how's my sound uh it's it's good enough good enough too loud to oh no it's okay I can adjust it on my end but thank you for asking sure so tell me what So today we're talking about why men feel very rejected what do you think is going on there bro so I can give you my perspective in my experience and I I hopefully I don't we don't retread the same ground as all the other guys but um I'll give you my experience so I mean growing up like as I you know developed an interest in girls as like a teenager right I was told you know explicitly and implicitly that you it's up to me everything is on me for finding a mate asking girls out you know getting them to be interested in you the whole nine yards right um and so when a girl rejects you right she can have you know one of a thousand legitimate reasons for rejecting you that has nothing to do with you right you could be like I just I'm not looking for something you know I'm you know I'm lesbian or whatever but it doesn't matter because the way we are conditioned or at least the way I was conditioned was it's my fault I have to come up with an answer right so me personally like I've been beating myself up this whole time trying to figure out why I've been having no luck does that make sense yeah it makes sense so can you tell me a little bit about oh so help me understand it doesn't matter what her reasons are it still comes down to me help me understand that thinking a little bit yeah so it's like you know all right I'm gonna pull Dr K can I think for a second yeah absolutely man um well it's just it's at least something that I believed right um where if a girl rejects me right it it has a hundred percent to do with me right it's either you know I'm not good looking enough I didn't do it correctly she's uh I don't know if she didn't like something that I said she thinks that she's out of my league it could be you know all sorts of reasons but they all have to do with me right so yeah so so that's kind of interesting okay because because on the one hand you're kind of saying it it doesn't have there are a thousand legitimate reasons that have nothing to do with you right but I do think I can understand this a little bit which is I think one of these things that we don't say out loud because it shouldn't be true right which is that if I was better I could have overcome that reason yes right so the experience of a lot of people is oh like this person said they're not looking in for a relationship and a month later they're in a relationship yeah and then the question is how did that happen and then you look at the person that they're in the relationship with and that person is more physically attractive more wealthy more whatever they're like oh how interesting on some Dimension right of their life they're doing better than you so you just gravitate to like oh well he's you know he's just in better shape but maybe he doesn't make as much money as he doesn't matter because he only gravitate to the dimensions that he's doing better than you interesting so so you're kind of suggesting that it's like psychologically internal that you're gonna make I think it is for me I mean because I've so I'm I'm turning 30 in like two months and I've never had a girlfriend before and so I'm kind of getting to the point where people are asking me like well Joe like you know how come you've never been in a relationship and I'm struggling to come up with answers and the one that I've come down to I actually joined um HG coaching just to kind of talk about this kind of stuff um the answer I've come down to is like oh I guess it's insecurity because I can't find any other reasons so and is your coach helping you move forward I took so I'm not in coaching anymore I think the angle that I took before the coaching was trying to understand like almost kind of try to come up with an answer to this question I'm talking about it's like why can't I why can't I uh uh find a girlfriend and the answer I came up with is I don't know but it doesn't seem to be anything in my past that I okay you know I did or am doing I guess I'm just insecure I don't know and and so I'm a little bit curious like so what has your experience with trying to find a girlfriend been like so let's see I mean in high school like I didn't really have any luck I I think I was really shy and not very social um so then I got to college and I got rejected a few times and I think it just like built up my insecurity so I I would like ask girls out less and less and less um and then I you actually were just discussing this with uh previous caller where I actually moved out to the suburbs right after college to get a job and so then everyone around me was like in a stable relationship that's right right so I literally I literally just moved back to the city just to solve this issue right um so and can you tell me a little bit about what your experience of being rejected in college was like um so yeah there was a couple different instances I could talk about um so one of them was like a very close friend of mine who I was like just head over heels in love with and it was it was pretty cringe I'm not gonna lie um and she basically said no like I I like you as a friend I'm not um I'm not interested in you that way and I I took that pretty hard um that was towards the beginning and then let's see there were others where I would get to meet them in passing through chance encounters like being at the library together and you know meeting through friend of a friend that kind of stuff um and I think I would either like go out on like one coffee date and then they would like stop texting me or they just wouldn't respond to my texts at all okay and and so how many how many women would you say you've asked out in your life oh God far too few um probably around like 10. and what would you say what would you say is an acceptable like what would what what's a number that you wouldn't be ashamed of oh God at least double that but I don't know I'm kind of making up numbers I guess in that regard yeah right so it's interesting because when I ask you a question what I get is a judgment yeah first right I'm embarrassed and 10 actually sounds like decent to me TBH I think this is where I I'm I'm a little bit confused so when I talk to people like asking one person out a year is like pretty par for the course yeah all right then I'm not doing so bad then I mean you well I was before I moved out to the suburbs but I I like seriously like I I don't I mean I think like asking one person out every three months is like on the high end of what I've seen yeah no not forget it I'm not but but I mean I think because I it's it's not like it's not like you're meeting like 60 people a day you know like even a month like you don't meet that many people well okay so here I mean so this is interesting so this is also part of like the conditioning is where like when I talk to friends and other people about this they always come up with answers like well you got to get on the dating apps dumb dumb and I'm like I am on the dating app so I keep swiping right nothing happens so I guess I'm not photogenic it's like well you gotta ask more girls out and it's like well okay I guess but that's terrifying so what's terrifying about it well I mean all the stuff that we've been talking about it's like it's you know it sucks to get rejected and you know it's not like you know a for me like a woman that I'm interested in is single is uh not like hopelessly out of my league and has some semblance of a possibility that would be interested in me right that's like a lot of variables that I'll have to line up so you know they do all those variables have to line up before you ask someone out yeah kind of at least for me so number one is single makes sense number two is not hopelessly out of my league yeah so what what percentage of women would you say are not hopelessly out of your league oh God I have no idea that's that's another problem that I have it's like I actually don't know and the third thing is are are would even remotely be interested in you that sounds just like would she give me the time of day like does she even like pay attention to me when I talk to her do you think that that number is small or is that number big like what what percentage of women do you think don't pay attention to you when they when you talk to them it's smaller than it used to be definitely but like I guess when I was in college and especially high school that would it was much larger here's the other problem is that I think my formative years on this subject were in high school and college right which you know the environment the inter-social environment of those places is different than you know being an adult in the working world right so it's like I'm I'm working off without dated assumptions but it's all I got am I making any sense here you're making a ton of sense okay good because I'm not looking at chat on purpose good you shouldn't I I'm just trying to think about so here's what I'm hearing Joe on the so I'm hearing that like the foundation was like I'm sort of hearing that the boat has sailed like do you feel like you kind of missed the yeah totally all right friends I mean I I'm out of college I've been out of college for a few years all my friends they're either in stable relationships for multiple years and or they're married like I went to like 50 weddings last year okay and not actually 50. I'm with you so so I'm hearing that everyone around you is is getting into a relationship and getting married and stuff and you're like what I'm really hearing is that you've been left behind yeah at least I feel like I've been left behind yeah and and can you tell me a little bit about you said when you were growing up explicit you were told explicitly that it's up to you can you give me an example of that like what what were you I guess just in media and and the way you know other kids talk about it it's just like you have to ask girls out like that would be something my dad would tell me like he'd be like well you gotta go he he's a boomer so like he did he didn't understand like how people talked in like the mid 2000s and stuff he's like well you got to go call him up and it's just like Dad I don't have a phone all right you get the point right yeah oh absolutely yeah no I I think it's we don't do that anymore dad yeah I know right so his his Solutions don't work for the Genera the world that we live in today which yeah I think is a huge problem here yeah and he would always harass us well he used to and then we told him to shut up but he would bug us for like not having a girlfriend or not getting a family start it's like Dad you were like 38 when you married mom like stop shut up really oh yeah what's your understanding of why why your dad got together at 38. oh God I don't know he I that's hard to describe on like on life have you asked him um he's not really like someone that uh like I would talk to about these kinds of things he's he's from the generation of children should be seen and not heard yeah I'm with you but I don't know man don't you think it's kind of weird dude like dad got together at the age of 38 and here you are at 30 like yeah so what a hell of a coincidence dude why so okay I'm trying very hard not to dox myself my brother yeah five years older than me and I don't think that he's ever been in a steady relationship either and we're not like here's the other thing we're not like crazy in cells like we don't hate women it's just we're bad at this yeah we're just really bad at this no I I'm with you man and and so I'm I'm not getting the sense that this is a I'm getting the sense that this is like a uh nurse a skill no no the opposite it's like a cop like so here here's what I'm envisioning okay so like we learn things from our parents like our parents teach us stuff right well they're supposed to oh no they teach us stuff either way okay it's not always good stuff that's the problem we learn from our parents not not what they're they're supposed no I mean they teach us stuff no no matter it's a half the problem is half time is bad they teach us the wrong stuff but they're definitely teaching stuff and what I'm hearing is and I've seen this pattern before where it's like parent barely like scrapes by and manages to find a relationship and then the kids are screwed yeah like some weird like like here's here's how I would put it I've seen so many parents that there's only one person in the world that they could have a successful relationship with and they manage to find that person yes and then they teach that formula which works for like one out of a million to their kids and then the problem is that's a crappy formula because it just worked once yes and so I mean if you're telling me that your brother is older and neither of you all have been in a relationship like I think I don't I mean sure there's always going on there right yeah yeah that's not that's kind of weird yeah it is and I think it's something about the way that you're probably like taught to relate to people and one of the things that worries me a lot is that like I think you've got to start asking out people who are out of your league because I think the problem is that you're misjudging your league yeah I don't know I have no no Compass or barometer of that respect yeah I'm I'm not I mean I think this is very helpful Joe from from like my learning standpoint I'm I'm both worried and optimistic for you at the same time because I I'm not hearing anything that I think is like irreparable in fact I know it sounds kind of weird but the crappier your upbringing is in some ways the better shot you've got because it's not really your fault I should be very clear like I had a perfectly fine upbringing like they they raised me and my brother perfectly fine just in this one particular Dimension is just nothing yeah so that's my point right so I'm not saying and this is what's so confusing is that we all think that like oh like if I had a traumatic upbringing which one person was kind of chiming in that a lot of this does have to do with trauma like so sometimes people feel unlovable because of trauma and that's one of the reasons why they lower themselves in their eyes or they you know push people towards rejecting them there's all kinds of crap that goes on there but the other thing that I I just know because I mean my household was like this too were like I wasn't taught like certain basic things about life which were like 101 level skills that you need to be like socially successful yeah and and it's not I mean my my upbringing wasn't traumatic it was just my parents didn't know how to teach me like some stuff yeah and and so and and I struggled for it and so like the one thing that I'm kind of optimistic for you about is on the one hand I because I'm not hearing that there's anything wrong with you oh okay that's good do you think there's something wrong with you no no more than anybody else like everyone's got problems but not like okay can I can I ask you this is not medical advice Chad this is not medical advice he's not diagnosing me so so but let me ask you why don't you think there's something wrong with you um because I think all around like if I look if I were to take a step outside myself and pretend I wasn't me I was someone else I'd say Well he seems to be doing all right across most dimensions of his life like he has friends as a job is reasonably healthy like I'm getting by so yeah and so so this is this is what is kind of hopeful and also absolutely terrifying Joe you sound like a completely normal decent guy okay that's good and that's what you're saying about yourself right yeah yeah no and this is actually what terrifies me is that the majority of men that I've talked to are not degenerate [ __ ] who are abusive the majority of men who are struggling to find relationships and feel really rejected or getting rejected are actually like completely normal men yeah and I I don't know what's going on but it's scary but I don't I don't think it used to be like this yeah I think I think you're right about that I think one thing I would add to that is you know you can quote unquote slip through the cracks in one way or the other like for me like I never learned how to form romantic relationships right well qualify that as slipping through the cracks if that happens to you I think the as far as I can tell at least up until just recently like until like HG was a healthy gamer was around like the people out there that would help help you with these kinds of things like influencers most of them are complete charlatans and you know there's plenty of names I could come up with I'm not gonna turn the stream into discussion on those people but I think everybody knows what I'm talking about so one it's easy to slip through the cracks two there's no no one to help you other than snake oil says salesmen and three you if you end up in the situation many people will probably think that there's something wrong with them which I thought for a long time until I learned how to make friends so so you what so uh here's my thoughts so first of all you learned how to make friends when did you learn that College okay I kind of started to figure it out in high school but it was really College here's what I'm getting scared of Joe you say slip through the cracks I'm beginning to think that the cracks are getting wider and wider and wider and slipping through them it's not slipping through them it's just falling is now becoming the default position it's not a slipping through the cracks you're going down the drain and and and I don't know quite why that is but it it's it's like yeah I I I don't know and we're going to try to help you I don't know exactly I can't tell if coaching was good for you or not but I'm I'm going to think about that a little bit and what we can do to improve it um but you know usually we're able to help people like you and I'm hearing that you got some benefit from it but boy I wish your coach could have helped you find a relationship yeah well I think the problem was is that I didn't understand why I don't have a relationship and I wanted to know and I think what I kind of learned is that there isn't really an answer to that question so that's actually a very important Discovery honestly because so a lot of people I know it's kind of hard but a lot of people think that there's a Smoking Gun for the problems in their lives yeah and so they keep on looking for a Smoking Gun but if you look at most things in life this is like from a medical scientific perspective most things are something that we call multifactorial so why don't you have a relationship it's multifactorial it's a combination of digital stuff the way that you were raised being unlucky finding a job in The Burbs there's all kinds of RNG that results in this thing right and one of the best things that I think you can do is stop looking for a Smoking Gun because you won't find one sometimes yeah um but one thing that I would kind of leave you with is that that you said there are three criteria that you look for before you ask them what is that they're single that one you should probably stick with uh but depending on how good looking you are and how tall yeah I'm no home wrecker trust me um people who are not hopelessly out of your league let's assume that that's kind of fair and you don't want to do that fine but what even remotely give you the time of day that's the one that you've got to be super careful about because there's an objective truth to that and there's what your confidence tells you is safe which if you're looking for safety and to try to avoid rejection chances are you're not actually shooting for the people who um you're gonna actually lower that standard right right because you you're trying to I mean is your strategy let me ask you this Joe is your strategy to minimize rejection yeah I think so based on just like my thought process how I approach it like I kind of I feel like I have to stack the deck in my favor as much as possible before I take any kind of action yeah so that's a problem dude I don't blame you I don't think it's your fault for having that strategy so once again just like women who stop trusting men the strategy that you develop is based on survival and I think if you're if the strategy is to avoid rejection what's the perfect solution Joe what can you do there it is can't get dumped if you don't start dating yeah you have a perfect strategy to avoid rejection yeah exactly just don't do anything I'm just gonna sit on my Discord server and play video games what do you think you can do about that oh God so hmm I don't know because I've done some of it before it feels like I've tried a lot of stuff before and it never worked out like when I um when I lived in the suburb in undisclosed suburbs I uh I tried you know joining like a gym where I could get like to know other people outside work because um work wasn't really I wasn't really meeting people at work and I didn't really want to like date anybody at work just because make things way more complicated than it would have to be um that I think that's actually all right I think that's another problem was like I don't really know what I can do about it I don't know okay so let's think through it so you said you tried joining a gym yeah uh what what do you think you can so think about it like what do you think you can do so it sounds like joining a gym didn't work fair enough I don't think a gym is actually a great place to meet people usually people go to a gym not to socialize no it was good for my mental health though good do you still go to the gym uh not since I moved I've actually been pretty bad about that I'm trying to find another one in this area okay still getting the the routine started up what else do you so aside from Jim what do you think you could do what do you think this is the challenge here what's holding you back I guess it would just be meeting people I don't know where to go to meet people where the environment is acceptable enough one the environment is acceptable where I could like ask people out and two where I could meet a reasonable number of people where I would actually have a chance at finding someone right yeah I I think there's some stuff here that you're kind of shooting yourself in the foot because when you say there's a reasonable chance of finding someone that's the kind of thing that our mind tells us that the part of you that wants to avoid rejection will love because it can squeeze itself into that okay does that make sense I think I know what you mean what do I mean when I so it's it's like your mind is is sort of like trying to protect you from getting rejected by like um what's the word like raising the criteria for taking action kind of like stacking the deck in your favor right yeah minimize the chance of rejection yeah I get that so Joe let me ask you a question what is an idea that you have come up with that your mind has told you is not a good idea because it won't work or it won't be efficient enough probably going out to bars more do you like going to bars yeah every now and then not as much as I I used to like I'm I can't I can't throw the drinks back like I used to be able to and how often do you go to bars now oh it's been lately I want to say like every couple of weeks like a couple times a month on a good month not that often when's the soonest you could go to a bar the soonest um I mean I could go tonight if my friends were up for it that's the other thing I won't go alone sure I don't think you should go along so what can you do about that uh I can invite my friends out but I mean they're there's like a you know at least a 50 chance that they'd be like nah I don't feel like it tonight doing couple stuff I'm busy all sorts of other stuff good yeah so what are you going to do uh not go by myself sure so what are you gonna do stay home okay so Joe I don't know if you can tell there's a 50 chance that you can go to the bar with your friends tonight and are you gonna ask them are you gonna invite them well it's like three degrees out so not tonight but on another night yeah I would okay so if if weather's in the way that's a whole different ball game but I I can't I can't tell so I'm gonna kind of like leave things here but I'd encourage you to this whole conversation smells really fishy to me because first I asked you like okay what do you okay I'm not gonna go alone fair enough and then I'm like okay so what could you I could invite my friends and then you're like well there's a 50 chance they will say no and somehow the conclusion that you derive from that is so I'm not gonna ask and then I push you on that because what's the like 50 chance of I mean that's a good chance like even if they have lives if you ask twice on average they'll say yes you can ask about this weekend you can ask about next weekend and the moment that I push you towards that what does your mind do Joe and it comes up with excuses say no no no it won't work for this reason bad reason yeah do our bars closed because the weather is cold where you are Joe no but I'm lazy ah and then and then so now you're playing your trump card Joe it's like now you're on the ropes so you're playing your trump card I'm lazy and this is like a once in a once in a year like cold snap so I'm okay so to be serious to be serious like yeah I mean I that's something I would do every now and then and it is something that I do very concretely I don't have the time to motivationally interview you to get you I'm sorry I didn't need to take up too much time no no I'm you don't have to apologize I'm just saying I don't have the time to do what needs to be done here which is why you're gonna have to do it yourself right which is like really think about what's getting in the way for you to check the weather and text your friends today hey in two weeks do you all want to go out and do whatever and you can dodge like you can call yourself lazy and like you're gonna outplay me Joe like you're gonna you're the you're the boss here you're gonna keep watching yeah I mean I can't win you've made that clear yeah well thanks for your time doc you're very welcome my friend I'd also if one day you wanted to give coaching another shot I would work on this this our coaches are very good at okay so I I think in a weird way I wonder if you even signed up looking for the wrong thing yeah maybe I might try uh individual coaching as opposed to uh I did group groups yeah so so and this is the kind of thing where like I would tell your coach and maybe they'll sniff this out that you have trouble like taking social action and that your mind runs circles around you and they'll help you with that they'll they'll point it out to you too but I mean I I think it's like Joe there's I mean there's just so much here like I I think I think you've got a serious shot at a relationship honestly I do I I don't you know there really I can turn this franchise around is that what you're saying no I mean I I don't think you even need to turn the franchise around I think that thinking is wrong it's just you have to take the blinders off you're already pointed in the right direction you've got a life it seems like you're a decent human being it sounds like you're empathic sounds like you're financially independent sounds like you're thoughtful about yourself like I don't I don't even I mm-hmm turning it around I think is a um turning it around I think is once again underselling how far you've come right because there's a lot of things that I think I mean I think a lot of women would be interested in you if you'd give them a chance I'm not going to get into that but okay thank you thank you so much fair enough I apologize for making that statement no it's okay it's not anyway a lot of good lots of stuff to unwrap and honestly Pro like thank you so much for being a part of this community like we built this place for people like you oh that that means a lot to me and people like you is is people like me like I don't see myself as really much much different from you at all so well take care thanks for not thanks for not rejecting me you're most welcome better luck next time [Laughter] adios all right all right hello my friend how many people do we have left ionized uh just one okay after me okay go for it my friend I'm sorry what do you go by uh Mitchell Mitchell talk to me Mitchell what's up why why do you think that men feel so rejected nowadays um I think it's been touched on a little bit but uh I think that men are usually in the initiator role more often and and then uh so like I've been in that position a few times and the one instance that I'm I'm kind of thinking about is um so I I wrote some some notes down is it okay yeah please redo that so uh I said when when a man goes to ask a woman on a date you're putting yourself in a extremely vulnerable position um and it's kind of like it's kind of like uh you're taking off like all your End Game Gear almost you're you're going to see if the ladies internet interested enough in you too or Internet interested enough in your like base stats to see if she wants to go and like fight dungeons with you or something okay and then so it's like you're sticking your neck out and then when she says no then it's kind of like it's kind of like this this dagger where you like you just took off all your armor and that no like does a lot more damage than uh then maybe she realizes what help me understand why the dagger hurts so much uh I think it's it's kind of like um you're you're seeing if this person thinks that you're you're worthy in a way does that make sense like yeah so if you're worthy enough to be a potentially life partner okay so so if I'm hearing you correctly Mitchell it when you ask someone out it's a test of your worthiness yeah I think so at least for that person but I think that um hold on a second for that person or well yeah that's what I was going to say is like in in that situation that person thinks that you're not worthy but that does damage to your own self-worth right so it you take that into your next interaction so so I'm and when you say kind of taking off your End Game Gear I just want to make sure I understand that analogy what I'm sort of hearing is that you're really like making yourself vulnerable You're like dropping your armor rating to zero right right yeah so like any any like maybe you got rejected in the past and you you have some like walls that you've built up to try to protect yourself and maybe that manifests as like avoidance where you just like oh I got rejected I'm not worth enough why should I even try so if if eventually you get enough courage to go and ask somebody then you're like taking off or taking down those walls taking off the armor and then yeah exactly I'm gonna do this I'm gonna give it another try and then they say no and it's like oh I knew it like it's still the same and it it hurts what is it that's the same uh that that same pain that you felt the first time that that made you build that initial wall and then and then you take it down to try to to try to see if somebody else likes you enough and then if they don't then it's like okay ouch again and then maybe likes you enough to do what uh to go on a date or be in a relationship and so what I'm hearing you kind of say Mitchell I know you say you're not kind of good enough for them but what I what I'm honestly reading between the lines is that it's a value judgment on you it's not just about their preferences like it's like if you were better they would say yes right right is that how it feels uh that's how it feels yeah what where do you think that feeling comes from uh I don't I don't understand what you're asking why do you think it is that when someone rejects you that has more to do with you than it does with them uh I think I think it does have like from their perspective I think they it has most to do with them like like you say like preferences and and um and that sort of thing but to to me or to the man it it feels like it's about them even though it might not be yeah so I I'm with you and I think this makes a lot of sense like that what their reasons are is not what we experience as men right right so the experience as men that I think that's kind of the the disconnect is like what that that um person that you were talking about your previous stream I think she views it as not having a big impact because from her perspective it's not about him or it's like maybe about different reasons but to him it's it's all about him like if he was if he was more fit to her to her preferences than she would have said yes or gone on a date with him yeah I I think this is very helpful I'm gonna ask a question questions in a couple of different ways um I'm kind of Flying Blind here so please let me know if the questions are not don't seem to sit well with you or you don't know how to answer them or whatever or if you don't want to just like please let me know can I count on you for that yeah sure so are you seeing anyone right now I am yeah damn it God damn it Mitchell yeah I know I was I was gonna kind of preference or uh preface this with with that but uh yeah I've been I've been dating somebody for almost a year um well before that before that I was single for six years okay so so let me ask you when you were single for six years okay I I want to understand what did it say about you that you were single for five years uh like what did that mean about you as a person really know I think that in a in a way I was like people well I in my specific case um I just wasn't in that many situations where I would meet a lady so okay so that was that was a big influence but I was in university for a portion of the six years so I was seeing people like I was meeting people but um yeah I guess I just wasn't at the time like ready for that okay so so because here's here's what I was curious about is that that when you said kind of like manner put in the initiator role and I think our our previous caller also kind of touched on this that the responsibility is placed on us as men usually to you know it's up to me that's what we're taught yeah is that the initiation you mean I I think the initiation is what you sort of focused on but I think that we're sort of taught that the better we are the more likely we are to find a relationship which just sort of makes sense right like obviously but but I I I think that there's there's something about I wonder if I wonder if it is like conditioning around value that I'm worth less as a human as a man not as a human being but as a man if I'm unable to find a partner like it says I think some people think that yeah what does it say about have you ever thought that about yourself uh I don't think so not not to a a notable extent at least so that's so interesting because I wonder if that explains why you're dating someone now maybe so so can you tell me a little bit about since you're in a relationship and you seem happy damn it yeah can you tell me a little bit about how that relationship started if you feel comfortable disclosing I you know uh it was how'd that happen dude because six years yeah quite the dry spell you're you're damn right um yeah it was I was just kind of like so for the six years a lot of the time I was just like like I would have thoughts like am I ever like am I gonna be alone for the rest of my life like stuff like that you know and I think that's like pretty normal if you're if it's been a long time like oh man what if I never find somebody but I was just kind of like I don't know like let's just hope it happens so I I was kind of like giving myself hopium in in that sense but uh but the way that I started dating my girlfriend right now was uh through a friend actually they they met online like on a on a dating app but they were just kind of friends and then um and then we all hung out one time and then I dm'd her the next day Mitchell yes sir I'd rather I've I've certainly read a Reddit post about you really yes do I know about this Reddit post you may have read it about you as well you may not have realized it's you but I met this girl on the dating app we went out a couple of times we hung out with with this friend of mine and now they've been together and I got friend zoned have you seen have you seen that that Reddit post uh I haven't but that's that's uh that's basic that's a similar situation that happens all the time one second I unplugged my headphones okay we're good all right yeah so that's so interesting so you just like diameter and and then what and uh it was I don't know I guess she just liked me enough when we were hanging out that she like was like oh he dm'd me and then DM me back but it was it's kind of like what [Music] um I think I think she put something on her Instagram story and I just replied to the Instagram story and you all just started talking and you just asked her out or what uh yeah we were talking for we were just texting for like a month and then um and then we decided like let's actually do something together and it was interesting because the the first sort of like date like yeah go ahead the first date was kind of like like I thought it was a date because I'm like super interested in this girl and then we like plan something and we go out and we're just there together so to me that was a date but we've talked about it and in her mind it wasn't to date so I'm like that's interesting so when did when when did she start to realize y'all were dating um that's a good question I don't know if we've talked about that that's interesting I mean for what it's worth I was in the same situation except I didn't realize I was going on a date well right but um that that's interesting so I I think there's something to be learned here I'm not quite sure what it is um but it sounds like you I mean you thought you were asking her out but you also said that y'all planned something where it was just the two of us so it also sounds like she was pretty active yeah okay yeah so it's like I think a a big portion of it was just like she was from the initial hangout she was interested enough in me that when I initiated then she was she was down to so just to be clear you were in the friend zone no I was never in the I don't think I was ever in the friend zone but you just said that that y'all were hanging out and she didn't think it was a date I don't think yeah I don't think she considered it a date I think her definition of a date is specific but I was always like a love interest okay so so she was attracted to you from day one yeah okay Mitchell I was always a love interest chat mode dude let's go easy boys yeah yeah oh man no but like it's okay go ahead now keep going this is great but but like but what I'm saying is like so back to the point is for six years I I went on like despite trying on on dating apps and stuff I like I know other guys who talked about this the stream but on dating apps like over six years I've got or I went on one actual date and it was terrible and I got like a handful of matches and so it's so what what I'm hearing is the formula to success to find love is to find some friend of yours who is hopelessly in the friend zone and then sweep in and since you're more attractive and clearly a love interest from the first moment that that's how you should be finding your women fine dudes who are hopelessly friend zoned and then I I'm just messing with you Mitchell I don't know yeah you know or anything but I do think it's it's kind of funny because I've never I've never talked to the dude I've read these stories and heard the frustration of men over and over and over again I've never talked to the guy who sweeps in right and I I would I would say to be fair to myself and to my friend that he and I talked at length about the entire situation before I was like before I went and like pursued my current girlfriend that that's it was it wasn't like I just like yeah went in and and started dating this girl that he started seeing but uh I like I went to my friend and we talked about it's like okay you know I'm interested in this girl like is that cool with you like and then we we kind of talked it out so sounds like solid bro code absolutely sounds good dude it's it's what it felt like so but but that is interesting I think I'm I'm really curious about so what I'm kind of hearing from you is like sort of RNG uh that's yeah that's how it feels a little bit okay and and part of that is like we were talking about the preferences you know you never know what their preferences are and like that's that's kind of RNG in a way but and and we've already talked about this where they they reject you because of their preferences but you think it's because of you yeah I and and how does it feel to be in a relationship for a year uh pretty good it's like scary uh like when you when you take bigger steps in the relationship uh there's like it's it's you don't stop being vulnerable you know it's like if if you I don't know if you do something big together then it's like like for example moving in together is like you've got to trust this person enough to live in the same space with you yeah Etc and just to clarify when you first asked your now girlfriend out the the end game armor was off uh uh I don't really know it's that that endgame armor analogy was for a different situation okay but yeah okay okay I I just kind of with my current situation I just kind of took a like casual approach I know somebody earlier in the Stream talked about um like dudes being fake and I I try my absolute hardest to to just be genuine because like if you're if you're trying to be a chameleon to everybody's preferences then then everyone will love you yeah right and you'll and you'll be upset the whole time isn't that how you get everyone to love you Mitchell uh not in my experience yeah have you tried to be a chameleon yeah uh yeah wise words man so I I apologize I had a little bit of Whiplash from your whole situation because you know I I think it's very easy to forget that like not everyone is struggling out there it's very easy I think a big part of your what you shared with us with which I think is really important is you can basically have one date in six years that was a disaster and still be okay it doesn't mean you're broken doesn't mean you're screwed what I'm really hearing is that the formula for success is what we've kind of heard before but is really still confusing which is kind of like accepting yourself authenticity and I'm sure that a lot of people who are listening to our first caller who is a woman who was like yeah I learned how to accept myself and there are a lot of dudes out there saying yeah that works for women it doesn't work for us yeah and and what I'm really hearing from you is that you know a certain amount of it is like luck um but you don't have to be an [ __ ] you don't have to take advantage of people you don't have to be manipulative I was kind of memeing with you a little bit but and it sounds like you guys had a really solid conversation so thank you for sharing that but I've met a lot of frustrated men who have been very very emotionally invested in a particular relationship that they did not make clear and then some friend of theirs starts dating because they're a little bit more forward right and it feels really bad when I'm stacking the deck so much in my favor and then like some dude comes in and starts dating this person and then I feel resentful because I've invested so much so I feel like I need to get some kind of like return on that investment which can be challenging but it's it's been really interesting I think it's been very helpful to hear in this in essence like a success story yeah yeah in a way definitely uh is a big contrast to to my life before meeting her so yeah and I think that's what's really cool is we're not talking about contrasting two different people which is oftentimes what happens is we start to think like oh they're the people who are good at relationships and then there's us who are bad at relationships but that actually you can be both and that change is possible yeah I think I think that uh like I was talking about earlier like that that um like being genuine and being honest was kind of like that was my kind of policy like as long as I feel good about myself after like I did all I could I was honest with myself like then if it doesn't work I'm not too chapped about it because like I don't know it I I was me and she didn't like it which is I'm still me cool yeah anything else you want to add Mitchell um I watching the stream uh before I noticed you you're holding a pen what pen is that it's a pilot g207 okay I'm very particular about my pens I yeah I was gonna ask if it was uh the same one that I got I got the the sarasa the zebra sarasa 0.07 or 0.7 is it a good pen it's great gel link uh you know what I I'm not sure uh I don't think so I don't think it's gel is it refillable or is it's like a disposable you know what uh that's out of my uh yeah I don't really I'm not like a pen person or something but I was thinking you were asking so I was like oh maybe I should switch if you were like a yeah I mean you should try it okay see like it's really it's really bold dark ink so good well I do like things that are bold and dark yeah it's great [Laughter] all right man take care all right see ya hello hello how are you my friend oh nothing twice about apologies I wasn't quite ready as I just saw you wrapping up the stream but I guess there's a bit of a delay how are you Doctor guy I'm doing well thank you for being patient uh no thanks for having me it's uh I've recently stumbled upon your content and I literally as I go out the shower this this evening here in the UK um I just choose just saw you stream and I thought I'd just jump on and uh luckily I got picked so uh thanks for having me awesome what's your name bro uh you can call me Damien Damien yep tell me a little bit more about this shower yeah well a stand-up shower after I've come back from work I'm not gonna do anything labor-wise but uh I was going outside working out came back took a nice hot shower as I got my water heater fixed soon and obviously stun with a full new stream and uh I was like hold on a minute I feel like I can kind of chip in some value in terms of my experience being only 26 years old obviously but I'm obviously in this generation right in the western generation and I see a lot of dating around me I don't participate in it myself but I just feel like I can you know give my point give my opinion and obviously you're a professional so you can kind of tell me how that sounds and uh give your take on it as well sure I'd love to hear your your thoughts Damien thank you for calling in perfect thank you well I really feel feel like it's really simple to fix this problem uh in the morning day and age you know people say right why can't More Than Dirt more than men get girlfriends right well it's because more than women end the game modern dating has changed significantly from let's say the 80s or 90s meaning in my opinion from my experience I feel like what you need really is to get either status money or looks and you can get yourself a relationship if you're endorsed if you're not improving it yourself if you don't have a good body fat percentage if you don't look good in the mirror I'm sorry that's gonna that's gonna stumble your dating chances and it's Common Sense really in my opinion and I feel like a lot of men can fix their problems if they hit the gym or if they hit the books to get that promotion or get that career get their pursue their purpose and women tend I think women tend to gravitate towards driven and successful men and I feel like if men just found their purpose got up and obviously for your support for a coaching understood themselves and began to sort of you know pursue what they want to do in life I feel I feel like a relationship will be the next natural thing and that's what I'm currently doing myself um you know improving myself and I hope one day I'm not looking for it but if it happens it happens so I I hear what you're saying so I and I don't think it's that ridiculous you're kind of saying that is this kind of like so basically you're saying if you're worth something as a dude it's easy to find a relationship right yeah absolutely yeah I think that makes a lot of sense what do you think it what do you think it is that makes it hard for people to do that well obviously different economic backgrounds uh where you've been brought up where you you know where you begin really life is a major factor genetics is obviously another a big thing obviously I would have to say but I believe there is always just deviating a little bit I believe there's always a person for a person but the problem is with social media in my opinion and what's happening now seeing this through obviously the lenses of My Generation Um is that you know women do have a lot of options and that's fair enough you know uh but this is the problem I I feel like it's like it's like going to Blockbuster that I was born in 96 but I still remember going to Blockbuster in the early 2000s you know we have so much so many films you're like oh yeah maybe I want to try this one this is quite funny but uh this one this one looks pretty good as well I feel like the problem is women have been given too many options and it's no human nature I feel like you want to get the best deal you don't want to be you don't want to feel cheated or you don't want to feel like you've missed out so I feel like in order to compete in the data market today men have to number one know their value and number two be prepared to obviously be on their purpose and to make and I know it sounds cheesy but to make themselves the best version of themselves currently possible do you think that um women have more options than men in terms of dating or just in general just like because you kind of said right like so so you're always going to want the best option yeah human nature will say you want to get the best option yeah yeah so do you think that there's a imbalance of how many options each gender has well in the moment of the day age certainly in the Western in the western Society women have now been put on a pedestal in my opinion and that's fine you know because you could argue back in the 1950s 60s you know there was a lot of you know the gender pager for example which some people have debunked I don't know my I don't know if that's 100 true or not but I just feel like at the moment women are reigning we're quite in a very metriarchical uh sorry I'm the only thing I'm pronouncing a very matriarchal society and I feel like normal normal Joe's normal men just can't compete with normal women anymore even normal women want six or sevens or eights and above you know um that's that's what I'm sort of sensing and feeling at the moment sure sure so so that's totally cool like that's why we're we're having you call on today and I think just because you're singing a slightly different tune from other callers like I love that you called in uh Damien I'm so glad you shared your opinion so let me ask you a couple questions um one is so you're saying that even average women want to pursue six sevens or eights so do you think that there are or is the number of single men and single women the same no definitely you know there's more single men than single women in my opinion and do you think that so what's the distribution of the curve so is it like a normal distribution where you know no I wasn't sorry sorry I wasn't saying no I would say there's a lot more single men than there are single women and the curve is way up meaning that loads of men as you can see while through obviously your various colors before and previous as well I feel like they're looking for a relationship and they can't find it and they're being given advice just to go out there go to the club but I I really feel like that's not gonna do them I need the service they look in the mirror then prove themselves wait so so this this is what I that that's fine I'm I know I want to understand what you're saying more than anything else because I think it's really interesting so if there are more single men than women roughly speaking the populations like 50 50 right maybe like 52-48 but generally speaking that age Gap changes the older you get because women have a life expectancy that's larger than longer than meds sure so what I'm curious about is how do you have a non-50 that's it oh that was okay can you hear me yeah yeah how do you how do you get that oh do you get that well listen I I don't know but what I what I feel like if we start recognizing our value as men like we used to before recognize our value and find our purpose go for our goals and make ourselves a better version of ourselves I feel like we can equal the Level Playing Field so just as women accept women have accepted weak men women have encouraged Chads Bad Boys you know to go and pursue them they've encouraged sleeping around them we've we as men have allowed this and women have allowed as well this kind of behavior right and I don't mean to sound controlling when I say we in men's have allowed this but we're both genders we both have equal say but at the end of the day each gender allows certain type of behaviors to carry on in a society and I feel like in order to get man back up to normal Level Playing Field of women they have to pursue their purpose and they have to find I don't know what they need to do in life wait so so when did we said we need to get back as men what what did when did we what did what did we lose and when did we lose it well Dr K I am uh I'm not from the Western Society I was brought up in the western society and uh if you look at other cultures they're very and I'm not saying we should go back to this but each gender had its own traditional role and you can see in previous previous historical periods these gender roles worked they worked for that time and period now we are evolving in society I'm not trying to say the West is bad away for nothing the West the best thing has happened to the 21 obviously the Human Society but I feel like if men and women do not have their purpose in a relationship the relationship is doomed to fail I.E you know uh man uh provides a woman keeps and maintains but with demonized traditional women these days we've demonized them so much the normal men you know are afraid to walk up to a girl and just say hey my name is you know uh Damien and I think you beautiful that's to some woman no no to some women that scene is creepy right and in order to get back to normal Level Playing Field I don't know what the solution is but what we're doing now is certainly not working sorry we're on the big round there apologies no I I love it I I think it's very uh I'm learning a ton Damien so let me ask you this so you said that we we've demon so there's a breakdown of traditional gender roles and and you're also saying that gender roles used to work right can you help me understand how you define work families bringing on the next generation of men and women moral values Family Values which are being eroded especially in our Western society today okay so what what's an example of a family value that is being eroded or a moral value that's being eroded um well took my head I would say um and again I'm not religious or anything right but I should say sex before marriages having loads of Partners as a woman or a man before actually committing to one individual can actually cause quite significant psychological problems and that's been documented you can research it yourself and I think that's one thing that sort of is demoralizing us as human beings um and sorry what can you repeat the question again yeah I was just saying so you said that traditional gender roles worked right and then and then I asked in what way did they work and then yeah sorry yeah that's it something about moral values and I asked you which moral values and then you talked about sex before marriage and how it's damaging psychologically and then you said I can research it I'm curious what do you think is the psychological damage of sex before marriage well there's a special chemical in the top of my head I'm sorry I wasn't prepared for this I don't know it's saying I'm happy to help you out yep so basically the chemical where when the woman the man sleep together it gets released and for example the more men or the more women sleep with a man uh with different men that chemical doesn't get released so much it's a chemical that release that bonds you through your partner that that's the one doctor okay yeah so that's that's the one so if you if you release the Sox I lost the name already if you release this chemical over and over and over and over and over again you're not gonna be as Community partner are you to you know no I mean what I'm confused so when you say when you release it over and over and over again so if I if I have sex with the same person I'm releasing the chemical over and over and over again right sex with a safe partner wow I don't know if it releases I've I think it releases once when you Bond obviously and then I'm not really sure on the signs of how that works but all I know is that from experience and other people's stories and you know how what they go through is that the more Partners a man or a woman that have obviously had more of a difficult a long-term relationship becomes sustainable that makes sense so yes and no so here's my understanding so there there is evidence that having sex with a lot of different partners can be damaging but that's usually uh people who are sex workers okay so and and I'm not you're allowed to have your opinion it's just I get super curious when people start saying like it's been documented and you can do your research because I you know I there's there's a lot of science that I've learned that supports what you're saying so for example the more that you have sex with someone the more commonly you release oxytocin and the more you release oxytocin the stronger the bond becomes right so this is why like every time a child breastfeeds there's a release of oxytocin for the mother and I'm imagining the child although I'm not up to date on that kind of research so the more oxytocin that gets released the more Maternal Child bonding there is so you're absolutely right that there's a chemical that gets released when this is slightly wrong but when people have sex that forms a bond now I could see how that could damage a relationship that could damage things because if you're having sex with a lot of different people you're forming potentially weak bonds with a lot of different people yep so that that makes sense to me oh and I think just because you don't you're not entirely up to date on the science doesn't take away your point you you know the point is still there's still a biological plausibility for that but I think this is also where like I'm just super curious when so but I'm not hearing that your beliefs are actually based in the biology no they're not they're not they're based in what exactly well I was just trying to and I again I went on a bit of around I want to apologize I love it no no no dude rant away my my dude this is great I was what you just said there is what I wanted to say basically but in a few words um but sorry what was your question again I was just curious what what do you base this on so you you kind of say okay so like there's a decay of like family values and then like what are the values and what and so then you said sex before damage is damage uh sex before marriage is damaging and then I said how so and then you were like they're scientific so why do you think sex before marriage is damaging because it's there may be some biological support of that but that's not it doesn't sound like that's why you came to believe that it's not like you read research paper and you're like oh look no no total evidence I would say anecdotal evidence from experiences that I've had from experiences of men have had and obviously a lot of reading through I've read the stories and um you know people sharing their opinions for your videos and uh not a lot of times I'll be honest with you yeah what kind of exp what kind of anecdotal evidence are you talking about like how can you give me like an example I'll just uh let's say males are females writing about their relationships what went wrong and a lot of red flags quote unquote being popped out and there's a lot of similarities into each story of okay this is a potential rough flag this is what helped the relationship crumble or the relationship you know not be you know as active as it could have been um similarities in in certain certain you know worries and experiences that people have had I see so so just you're you're kind of like you're reading stories about people and you're kind of concluding that since people are having sex before marriage it makes it harder to form strong bonds and relationships well no I don't necessarily think that 100 I just feel like that's a factor to play in right sure sure sure I'm not I'm not I've had sex before marriage I'm not you know a purist or like I'm not like Christian Bible bashing Christian or anything or a Muslim uh but you know I feel like if we just took our time if if we just sort of took away social media we will be better people or better Society not better if you're better there's a lot of evidence and and the the way that social media kind of gets into this is that it gives people an idea that they can do better mm-hmm and and so but if I'm if I'm understanding this correctly but there there is an imbalance in women who are in relationships and men who are in relationships right there are more women in relationships than there are men in relationships because I I think partly because men just don't understand their value they feel like if they just read that next pickup book or if they get their confidence up they can get a woman but I feel like women are just as shallow as men were equal in that playing field and it's time that men rose up to you know took their appearance as a priority took their career and purposes of priority and a relationship would just be a natural you know an actual consequence of their actions okay so let me ask you Damien how did you feel about your how long have you believed this um coming up to 126 now I think since my last relationship when I was 23 so like four years or so can you tell me a little bit about your last relationship and what happened yeah absolutely train back uh to any young man listening to this it's never a never long distance be careful when you're long distance because uh I was in a relationship a long distance for six months it was a very short relationship uh it was my last relationship three years ago um and I found out that the girl I was seeing now and again every week or so um when I was visiting her she was visiting me she was actually in a long-term relationship herself with a guy that suggests two kids with living in the same houses he did and as soon as I found out I just cut her off yeah so that was uh that led me to so she was having an affair with you uh well I was kind of like a uh I don't play toy for example I she was basically yeah using me and I felt really used and I was just like wow I can't believe women can do that because I was taught my whole life that you have to be you know this loving guy you have to always bring flowers you know compliment all the time and you know just be and just put them as your priority you know and how did you understand why you ended up getting used like how like how did that what's responsible for that situation of you bringing flowers visiting every two weeks and it turns out that she's like in another long-term relationship and has kids oh no no that's nothing I don't think that's responsible if I was to do that I don't think that would have changed anything but I was doing now I was quote unquote simping for this woman I made this woman my center of of attention you know uh we always texted always chatted and uh obviously no she was still in a different relationship I don't think that changed anything that improved it disproved anything but I just feel like um yeah I got played I got used I never you know and so what why do you think you got played why do I think yeah um because I was a bit I was a bit naive I think it was my second video without with my eyes real relationship and I was really excited I really found it pretty um we were talking every day and when I found well she told me actually she told me after six months she was seeing someone and I was just like okay I'm not seeing any more goodbye okay and and so what was the lesson that you took away from that relationship the lesson I took away was down long distance and be careful who you see because uh no one is nothing is ever As It Seems okay so how does that factor into all the stuff about status and money and looks well the status Emily looks again it comes from anecdotal evidence shared from you know uh channels where men share their dating experiences such as women women too and the common factor is always you know a man has success in dating when he improves His Image his appearance or when he improves his faithson work or his financial situation because I feel like women gravitate towards security as I guess a normal any normal human being will gravitational security and you know what's more secure than the man has got his [ __ ] together excuse me sorry he's got his stuff together um and you know has a plan for his life Wait So So you you're doing this a couple times Damian where you'll say women gravitate towards security and then you'll kind of say well any human would gravitate towards security yeah I want to be politically correct well so but what do you I mean so I'm confused about what you're saying because you seem to like what are you actually like if you think that women gravitate more towards security than men than just say so like I I don't know like half the problem I'm having this conversation is that you're playing political cover-up so I don't know what you actually believe so I don't even know what to try to understand well if maybe a trans woman you know is looking at this and she identifies as a woman I don't want to say that you know if she does has fallen great but I guess guys can guys can feel these feelings too so I don't want to single them out because it's not always 100 men 100 women sure guys can also feel the same way yeah but I'm hearing you kind of say that that on average women value security more than men that's what you believe no no but I will say most yeah on average right so I think the Nuance is very important we're not saying that all women are alike it's fine to believe that way and and what you're basing that on so what I'm really hearing you saying is that what you're basing that on a lot of the beliefs that you have are not necessarily not even from your own experience not necessarily from science although it sounds like you're somewhat familiar with a few scientific Concepts which I think are pretty valid it's really just hearing people talking about stuff both men and women who sort of state that a man who is more famous more attractive and more wealthy is is that a requirement to get into a relationship or is that make you more likely or what no I wouldn't say it's a requirement I would say if you wait long enough because usually women's fertility period starts from 30 to 35 sometimes can this down to 40 years old I feel like women tend to naturally settle for men and you know and you're going to go into relationship anyway you just have to wait long enough but I feel like if you wanted to get into relationship in your 20s these factors will play a major role in your success I.E status money looks and so so if you want to get a relationship you should try to boost status monitor looks in the in your 20s yes or early 30s yeah I mean I I think that there's some you know so I think if you ask most human beings would you rather date someone who's a 10 or a five most human beings would say 10. I think if you ask most human beings would you date someone who has a net worth of 10 million dollars or ten dollars most human beings would say 10 million I don't think that that's well no I mean I wouldn't say that I wouldn't say I don't want to date 10. I want to date on average goal that I find not only physically attractive obviously but Pleasant to be around as well we have common things as well you know I don't want to always go for the highest bid or the best price ever I would say why not because I don't think we need to aim that high I feel like we can get a normal relationship but if you want to get into a if you want to get a chance at the relationship game in the early 20s or early 30s you need these factors that's what I feel like yeah but what would you want in a partner would you want the most attractive partner and the richest partner possible no why not it's a good question um maybe because deep down I don't think I deserved that maybe there's a bit of self-judgment the other thing I deserve that or number two because I don't think that's possible or attainable so I'll say that okay so fair enough I think that that's a really good reason to not want a 10. so I I could imagine if I put not if I put my I've been here where you know I used to consider myself quite unattractive and I would be if I was actually dead if a woman who had a net worth of 10 million dollars and was an absolute 10. started dating me I would be terrified that this is going to end one day and what the hell is going on I would be so confused I would feel much safer with like a seven or an eight and yeah so so now my question is so if we're saying that if we're kind of saying and you tell me okay Damien that the reason that you're okay with less than 10 is what exactly maybe there's a lack of confidence or it it maybe it doesn't have anything to do with confidence no I think it does I think you're right sorry I think you're right on that I think it does have to do with confidence and I feel like I am not ready for a tent I'm just not built uh my body enough I have not um attractive enough for a 10 or I'm not Financial these Stables so tens deserve tens while they gravitate towards tens or nines yeah sure and and you do you think you could be happy with what would you give yourself out of 10 today uh well I'll say average I'll say five okay would you be happy with a five yeah okay so now here's what I'm kind of curious about do you think that something in some of the choices preferences that you have for your own choices okay like who you actually end up dating do you think that some of that is due to your gender uh sorry I don't understand the question so my preferences like so you're saying like I actually don't want a 10 I'd be okay with a five yeah do you think that you believe that because you're a man um no I I don't know I don't think so so then so I'm with you so then my question is why wouldn't a woman believe that too why wouldn't why wouldn't a woman who's a five be like you know actually I'd be more comfortable with a five because they've got social media and social media got plenty of options that's why well you've got women not most not all you've got social media no I don't what do you mean I I consciously made the effort to stay off social media okay so so so that that's where things differ because if you were using social media then then do you think you would want tense no but but I thought you said social media was responsible wow oh I see Ah that's very good doctor K yeah yeah okay okay well I feel like again when I said most women I feel like most women would want that but again there's the anomaly right there's the five to ten percent or twenty percent like me that will be no I just want to meet a nice guy you know that uh is on this purpose is you know it's semi-good looking and have a relationship with them I think I feel like there is women like that out there you know that shelter themselves away from relationships at the moment work on themselves and you know they are not out there seeking the next best prize I do believe there's something like that so yeah I feel like you know I'm not I'd say that I'm anomaly because I think there's so many men like me over here you know uh but yeah I feel like there's other women like me yeah I'll say that yeah so okay so what I'm hearing you kind of say is that there can be women who like you would be happier with a five than they would with a ten they're yes they can be yeah and very small percentage but yes I believe that what percentage Ah that's beef I'll be a little bit positive here let's go 20 okay okay and and so what we're talking about is just like sure those women are out there but they're the minority because of social media and and yeah okay other factors as well social media is just the big factors in my head yeah so Damien any questions for me like or any any thoughts well no I just wanted to share my opinion with you I just went to get your thoughts on my opinions yeah so so I'm about to do that so first of all dude from the bottom of my heart thank you so much for calling so I I think that in our community we tend to be quite judgmental towards people with your system of beliefs this is something that honestly kind of bothers me a little bit so like I think that there are a lot like so if what I'm really hearing from you is that if I want to enter into a healthy relationship I should be worth dating is that fair yes and right and yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah of course yeah and so your focus is like you're I'm not hearing I'm hearing that you're kind of downplaying some of your beliefs I hear that you're playing a little bit of the chameleon which is fine like I get it right because my guess is that in the past you've observed places where if you were really honest people would be quite judgmental towards you yes I do agree and we are in 2023 you know sure fair enough so so like you you have to say certain politically collect correct things and then I have to try to see through those things to see what you have to believe which is fine so so and I I appreciate the I think it's it's not I I think there's a lot of good compassion that you're demonstrating by like going out of your way to try to be like inclusive with people I think that's actually quite important and sets you apart quite a bit okay and I'm also hearing that basically you you had one situation where you were really taken advantage of and you're kind of as you put it simping over someone and um it was somewhat okay all right thank you um so what I'm kind of hearing is that you had a bad experience and then now you've realized I didn't quite hear you say this but I'm sort of guessing I'm connecting the dots here that if you were worth more that wouldn't have happened exactly if I if I understood that I could improve myself that I'm better than this um that I will be more careful as to what who I date and how I select uh obviously the day of my choice okay that's not quite what I meant but that's I think that's a far better interpretation thank you but and so now you're like you've decided that the way that you're going to approach relationships is that you're gonna like become a chat right like that's the goal like I'm gonna I'm gonna become a chad yeah and so and then you have this belief that since women want Chads the closer I get to a Chad the more I'm not even sure exactly what your end game is I don't know if you want to be dating lots of women or have get married and have kids or what you talk about family values or what yeah yeah so I want to obviously get into a relationship and uh just one um well we'll see what happens I guess I'm not actually pursuing it like I said I'm not making a big deal if it happens it happens but I'm focused on my career at the moment I'm focused on my appearance at the moment yeah yeah good good for you and so I I think you're just trying to become a better human being and you're sort of seeing that you're hoping that relationships will kind of come along and the more valuable of a mate you are the more likelihood you'll have to have like a good relationship right yeah and then I'm also hearing that oh a lot of this stuff that you're watching a lot of like YouTube videos and stuff where people are talking about this kind of idea that women have a lot of options they want you know eights nines tens the sort of like value judgment based on particular status things which I think there's some like data for right like I I don't think that that's that ridiculous of a view um but here's where I'd really question things is that that I think there are some places that I just encourage you to think about and I'd love to understand if somebody else wants to talk about it like so there's some perceptions which I just don't I can't connect in my mind so the first is that there are more lonely men or more single men than single women that if we're talking about roughly a 50 50 population split what that means is that women must be having more than one relationship in order to have men or like have you know open relationships or you know whatever right so the only way to make that equate the math work is if one woman is having a relationship with multiple men well that's that's that's certainly possible women some women not all some women do do that yeah yeah yeah yeah right so so if we're sort of saying on a global level like 75 percent of women are in relationships and 25 percent of men are in relationships like that math has to be worked out in some way and maybe it's 60 40 but even in the case of 60 40 or 52 48 which maybe maybe it makes sense that that's a huge I mean that's like we're talking about like millions of people so that's one thing that I'm kind of confused by um sorry just to just to clarify I'm just talking about sorry I should have clarified this in the beginning just from a western Society point of view I'm not talking about you know the other side of the world because I feel like in the Middle East or the East inside of the world you know I think things are more 50 50. just in our society as we're more you know as we're quite you know um what's the word I don't want to say advance but you know with comfort as a western Society you know I feel like these problems are most relevant in our society than other societies on Earth sure so I think these problems are the other thing that I would really encourage people to think about and really explore is the idea that older Society worked so this is I think honestly a romanticized notion so it depends on what your definition of like work is did we have more families and arguably monogamous relationships we don't really know I mean maybe a bunch of people are cheating and who knows but there were like a lot of indicators that you know family values come with like problems so for example like the rates of domestic abuse the rates of child abuse the rates of infant mortality like there's all kinds of stuff that used to be worse now it's hard to say that the decay of family values is responsible for certain bad things I also think it like people tend to romanticize the past but generally speaking like a hundred years ago Humanity was like way worse so some of those things you can say okay well the reason that Humanity was worse then is not because of family values that has decayed but the reason that infant mortality is better is because we have better medicine and stuff like that which is a fair point like that's absolutely a variable that's involved but I think there's this very common notion and if you go to other parts of the world and you see situations where there are traditional family values that like very strong marital structures no real options for divorce and stuff like that what you'll find and this has been kind of my experience and there's some data to back this up I'm not an expert in these particular statistics but I've definitely seen them is that these traditional Family Values societies tend to have like way higher rates of abuse okay and and then just the question becomes when you say work because like if if you're a woman in the west and you're in a physically abusive relationship or or a man but more so a woman actually you have options to escape which are socially acceptable whereas like if you go to India like and you're in a physically abusive relationship like you don't have any choices I want to say some something like 50 of my 50 of women in one to two generations in my family maybe that's a little bit High maybe closer to 25 percent were in like abusive relationships in my extended family and they just didn't have any options like and maybe my family is particularly bad but that may not be the case so I think a lot of it depends on what you say or what you mean by this worked this worked from the point of view that the next generation of people emerged how wanting to have families and wanting to get married if you look at our current generation I don't know how many people you can see they actually want to have a family or want to get married from that point of view and so so you're you're placing a value judgment on wanting a relationship or marriage is is better than not wanting a relationship or marriage better for the Human Society yeah in terms of evolution in terms of maintaining our you know our numbers and not going downhill our population that's what I mean yeah yeah right so there's an evolutionary argument for that there's also an evolutionary argument that our population has reached a particular point where the best thing for evolution is for fewer people to have children well I disagree with that I think there's plenty of land out there people can have children I think people should have children we're being attacked everywhere through chemicals in our food through pollution and through a common it's not your comments but for other further comments that say you know you should not you know look at the overpopulation don't have kids I I personally strongly disagree with that yeah that's fair I mean and anyway so what I think about this stuff is like I think Damian you found something that works for you I think you found I'm hearing that you found a plan for your life the most important thing that I'm actually taking away which I haven't heard you say explicitly but I'm sort of hearing and you let me know if I'm reading this wrong is you will be damned before you ever simp over anyone ever again 100 100 and so so you are going to accumulate as much power Prestige and money as you can so that you will never be someone's [ __ ] oh you guys Sports on dogs okay yeah absolutely I'm hearing that loud and clear clear my brother and and I I think honestly that's the kind of thing where as long as you don't step on the bodies of Innocence on your climb to the top I'd say you do you bro like if you wanna be a better human being if you want to increase your financial situation if you want to um have your body be in a better physical shape so that you can take like pride of what you want if you want to take responsibility over your life and start to like try to be as good of a human as you can I'd say all the more power to you thank you Dr Cat thanks for calling Damien no thank you very much it was uh I can't wait to listen to this tomorrow [Laughter] thanks for having me and maybe uh again soon I don't know yeah why don't you report back in a year or two whether you ended up in a relationship or not because maybe and how long have you been on this journey of of status acquisition by the way uh for years so quick question why don't you think you found a relationship yet because I go on to being one and why do you think that is because at the moment casual hookups and just looking at what's happening in in our generation is enough to put me off into having a relationship for now interesting so what I'm hearing is that there's an individual psychological component outside of status money or privilege or looks that is responsible for you being single today spot on yep okay maybe we could have a conversation about it later thank you very much you or or your friends Damien I'd be happy to talk to them too all right thank you doctor okay all right man take care all right so I know there may be people waiting but I think we're done for the day chat so here's here's the thing so I I know that there's a lot of toxicity amongst men nowadays but I really uh not no no exaggeration I love that Damien called in and I love that we talked to him because I I think it it really speaks to a lot of the challenges and here here's the thing if you look at what people view as toxic masculine role models the one thing that toxic masculine Role Models do really really really well and we got to be careful here okay is they validate the experience of men so there's a big difference between things are not this bad it's all in your head or other people have it hard too there's all kinds of invalidating stuff to say so what I've noticed about the quote unquote toxic which which I'm sort of using other people's terms because I'm I have a lot more to say about this and a lot more to think about this but the one thing that they do is they say yeah your life is hard and oftentimes what they do is they'll say yes your life is difficult here is the way that you can fix it and oftentimes I think that here is the way that you can fix it is where there's a lot of in my opinion immoral stuff that goes on right so just like I said to Damien like is you climb to the Top by all means just don't do it on the backs of Innocence but I think this is where as a society we are very very invalidating towards the experiences of men and and so just case in point like you know I've talked to a couple of women recently and and stuff like that it one prime example is they shouldn't feel rejected I'm not rejecting them that's your perspective what about their perspective it's the same thing as people shouldn't feel upset about non-consensual pornography or deep-fried pornography it isn't real in both cases we're not acknowledging the experience of someone else it's the same and that's the problem and so we're going to keep on seeing quote unquote toxic masculinity if those are the only spaces that men can go to receive support we're going to keep seeing those place this crop up right like I've got two options I can go to one place where people say yes your life is hard here's a path to fix it like does that sound so bad and then there's another place where people say you shouldn't be complaining what are you complaining about which way do you think people are gonna go and and I think that like you know there's some stuff here that's good like if we listen to Damien he's like I'm gonna put together my life and then I'm gonna be someone who's worth dating I don't think that's a bad view like I don't think wanting to better yourself as a human being and acknowledging that maybe like in order to have a relationship like I need to put some work in I don't think that's bad like I'm in a relationship I've been married for a while now and I still try to be a better person right like I'm working on myself like I want to be better I want to be a better human being to enrich the lives of the people around me all right I think the challenge is that oftentimes that betterment can come at the expense of other people I think oftentimes I think the problem is that it's it's surrounded the core idea I think is pretty good which is that you know like I should be a better person to find a better relationship fair enough I think what people Miss is that as he said I mean never said it until I said it which is a lot of this stuff is fueled by trauma honestly is what it sounds like but you know why men don't say oh this is the result of trauma you know why Damian didn't say that because we don't really let men be victims that's changing now thankfully especially in places like this community but that's it's a it's a big problem whereas like if you're a man and you say I'm struggling I'm traumatized how do people respond to you now I'd like to think that at least in our audience like I think the women in our community and a lot of women out there and this isn't like all women are bad I I want to say 50 plus percent of women are pretty good about this but the problem is that and this is half the problem with the Internet is that even if 90 of women out there or and by the way this isn't just women when we say when I say we don't allow men to be victims men don't allow men to be victims so this is the other thing is that we assume that okay if Society is not allowing men to be victims people jump to blaming women so a good example of this I was reading some research recently people will talk about unfair treatment in the court system which I would agree and there's a lot of good data that shows that things like child's like child custody and things like that there's discrimination within the court system are most judges women or most judges men I really don't know but when we talk about discrimination in the court system everyone's like and somehow discrimination in the court system leads to women being bad but hold on a second who's doing the Discrimination it could be man so the problem that I see with all this stuff is like we start from a real place and then we just jump to something else and what we jump to is based on our biases as opposed to what the reality is and some of it like is the more I try to understand it like some of this stuff just falls apart and there could be good reasons for it right so if someone says yeah there are more single men today than they're single women like that could be statistically true I don't know like I swear to God I'm gonna read up on it and I'm gonna see it's not my place to convince Damian that he's wrong it's not my place to debate him into submission it's my place to learn from him it's my place to investigate it's my place to try to understand what is the reality of the situation we're facing right now and that there may be some kind of like way that two things that feel like they're conflicting and this is the problem with gender Dynamics is that there are two perspectives which do not align and so what the men try to do is we try to yank the women over and say no we are right you are wrong let me debate you until you understand the error of your ways and the women are doing the same thing they're like y'all are wrong let me debate you until and and tug you over here and pull you to my side of thinking whereas the the honest truth is that there's probably something in the middle there's something we're missing here two perspectives this is something that is really good in dialectical behavioral therapy which is based on this concept of advait vedanta which is that two opposing things can be true at the same time this is something that we don't understand in the in Western Society this is weird but in the western Society we believe in the law of contradiction so if something is a it cannot be B something really cool in the East is they don't believe that so in the west we think that if logically a is true it cannot also be not true something can only be true or true in the East I know it's super bizarre it's a different system of logic they say actually yeah a can be true and a can be false and then everyone's like what the hell do you mean I'll give you a simple example I love her I hate her those can both be true when you actually look at experience sure in the abstract logic these things cannot be true but in the experience of human beings two opposites can be true women can not reject men and men can be rejected that's bizarre right so instead of men trying to convince women y'all are rejecting us too hard are women trying to convince men we're not rejecting you like those both those experiences can be true and we've heard it today that's why we have conversations like this because the conditioning that we grew up it means one word means different things to different people one experience can have two different impacts and that's where this rub comes down to right because like there's data support this right so I'm not 100 sure by all means like correct me if I'm wrong but my understanding is that there are it is easier to ma women have more choices on Tinder than men it's an isolated statement I'm not saying women have dating easier or anything like that on a particular platform there's a lot of strong evidence that shows that it is easier for a woman to find a man on Tinder than it is for a man to find woman Tinder Publishers research about this and so it kind of makes sense to me that when a woman gets rejected by a man there may be other options and I think this is an analogy that made sense to me I'm not saying it's correct that the rejection hurts a lot more when it's the only one you got you've got one shot so it's Do or Die I also think I learned a lot from talking to Anita about how sexuality is used to debase and dominate women it's used as a power Dynamic so that's really interesting and the other thing that I'm beginning to learn is that so a lot of women are judged based on particular things their value as a woman comes down to so she was talking about for example like you know fertility so a lot of women's value is a is judged by some to be based on their capacity to be sexual objects which is bad I think the interesting thing is what is the value of a Man based on because what I heard from the men today is my value is a man depends on whether I can get someone to say yes so I anyway I'm this was great for those of y'all that are joining us for the first time on YouTube welcome um I'm really grateful I apologize that we were not able to get to all of the comments thoughts I've been reading more today than I usually do um but I think the one thing that we can all agree on men women and everything in between and Damien there are problems right now that's the one thing we agree on things are [ __ ] so then the question is what are we going to do about it so they're going to be some people who will say here is the problem here's the answer this is what you should do the problem is a lot of people are very very definitive and a lot of them disagree so here's what I can tell you here's my offer to y'all it's my belief that good diagnosis precedes good treatment and part of the reason that I think gender Dynamics are getting so much worse is everyone is jumping to treatment without understanding what the problem is so men are formulating all this advice for men and women are formulating all this advice for women but I'm not hearing dialogue I'm not hearing understanding so that's what we're gonna do we're gonna try to understand what's going on and this is something where I need y'all's help and I need your help with this way more than I've ever needed your help with anything before this I've needed your help for all kinds of stuff and you all have been absolutely there for us and we're grateful for that and there for us means showing up when we stream means donating or whatever means we built Dr K's guide and some of y'all were like hey maybe I'll pay money for this thing and maybe it'll help me most of y'all are pretty happy with it pretty much right it's a good product so you guys have helped us a lot already because I don't I don't you know I do very little clinical care now because I can put food on the table thanks to you all and I'm grateful for that but I need your help more today than I have before and there's one really big reason for that so far what we've been able to accomplish at healthy gamer has a lot to do with my knowledge and expertise but newsflash that has limits and never has it been more limited in this for a couple of reasons the first is that I'm not a woman I can't know what the experience of being a woman is like and what's even worse I even have colleagues who do to some amount of academic training will think that that is a substitute for being a woman on this Earth which I don't think that's the case so I need the help of all of the women in in our community to help me and all of the uh all of us men to understand the other thing which honestly I'm lucky about I can thank my karma is that I'm not dating today I got lucky I'm a boomer I missed the boat on online dating so I have no idea what this is like so then the question becomes what do we do here at HG do we only do things that Dr K is the expert on or do we do the work that needs to be done and we're gonna try to do the work that needs to be done I'll do my part which is read this book okay and I'm gonna read I have about 20 papers on infidelity that are sitting on my hard drive that I'm going to read over the weekend so I'm going to do my best to synthesize science literature my experiences working with people who have been cheated on who have done the cheating marriage counseling all this kind of crap I'm gonna do what I can but I need you all's help and the way that I need y'all's help is exactly like today and we need to hear from you all and not just the ones that are PC huge props to Damian because saying that kind of stuff is absolutely applauded in one corner of the internet and absolutely vilified in another corner of the internet thank you very much I don't know does can you rate you can't raid someone can you I don't know how to do that Dr K becomes dating coach maybe one day um Alfonso cardoso is very nice he's saying don't work on a Sunday Dr K I work seven days a week we made a YouTube video about it you can watch it if you're interested I think it's interesting so I have lots of thoughts I I think it's fine work seven days a week like I think it's totally fine to work seven days a week but there's a way to do it and there's a reason to do it and there's a way to do it without burning out um and not just Amy and everybody else too like we had uh Luna at the beginning that was great like everybody was great and that's what's awesome about this community like that's what I honestly I love about y'all is that we're not an echo chamber we're like the one place on the internet that isn't an echo chamber um Eric Clarkson is saying I'm the gaming specialist at Hopkins and wanted to thank you for your videos they're very helpful in informing my interactions and playing games with pediatric patients awesome dude thanks for joining us and let us know if we can help more um fire embleming I just installed V Rising chat and I am hooked so hard not to play that game I'm gonna eat something and then maybe I'll spend some time with my children and then if I have if I'm lucky I will play some V Rising I don't know how to raid on this or if there's some function like that but I want to thank all y'all if you've been here for the YouTube thing mad respect and we're gonna I don't know what we're gonna do or yeah so thank you
