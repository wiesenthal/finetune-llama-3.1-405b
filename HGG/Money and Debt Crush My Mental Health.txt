you fix what you can and if you're still unhappy there and your workplace can't accommodate the rest or aren't willing to accommodate the rest or whatever then you should consider finding a different job or whatever welcome uh thanks what do you go my friend I go by snow snow yeah cool so what are you working on snow uh yeah so my prompt was I want to work on moving on on the contemplative to preparation stage of change I've been trying to change for many years and I think I have decent awareness into myself but it's still not enough to make me want to take action okay wow that was very well thought out thank you you sound uh so uh can you tell can you explain to us what the contemplative versus preparation stages are although like full disclosure I have a slide up so I'm gonna like read all of that so the contemplative stage of change is where you're aware the problem exists but you don't have commitment to action and the preparation stage of changes when your intent on taking action to address the problem okay very well said so you're aware that there's a problem but you're not motivated to take action yeah or there's like a strong resistance okay is there a strong resistance yeah there is a strong resistance and I'm even aware of like the different factors of that resistance but even that is not enough to make me want to change okay can we go into some details now yeah for sure so I guess like I actually want to say that the previous um the previous caller um kind of helped a bit more and it is kind of related to my situation but just with a different details so um yeah just to go into a little bit more detail about my situation it's that so I'm really struggling in terms of changing with my belief towards money and how it ties to survival because it's weird because I don't even I didn't I didn't grow up poor or anything I like grew up middle class so I don't it's weird because yeah I don't feel like I have any strong um negative Early Childhood stuff related to that so I don't really know where that church strong belief came from but I have this like I've been saving um since I was a little kid and so maybe it was like the ego syntonic stuff that I really built up plus later negative stuff happened um but basically sorry just my belief around money is that So currently I'm unemployed but I've been working full-time I was working full-time for about like four to five years and I was burnt out for my job um and possibly the whole industry as well but I'm really having trouble because like I've tried several times so I even like tried part-time options just to see if it will work better with the burnout and stuff but I found that it still didn't work in terms of like pressure and stuff like that um and I'm trying to find like yeah trying to career change and stuff like that but there's this part of me that like doesn't want to work honestly and there's also a part of me that like lacks Direction and that's the thing about myself it's like I find it hard yeah I find it very hard to know well it's like sorry no I do know some things that I want I think the resistance to money also spending money is one big factor that um holds me back okay So when you say you what So when you say you want to move on to preparation what's your goal so what do you want to be able to do that you're not able to do right now say things like probably not enough to last me the rest of my life but at least I can go for a few years um especially because I still live with my dad right now um so either one option is to be okay with um like kind of be okay with taking it slow because I also find that I'm quite impatient option two is like I guess you could say the ideal or what I think I should be doing which is like you know to find a better job that suits me more okay all right so let me understand so can I think for a second snow yeah thank you for calling in today by the way no I'm so happy I got chosen somehow yeah I feel very grateful too yeah I it makes me sad that people I mean I'm glad people feel grateful but it makes me sad that we don't have enough time to get to you know everyone who has questions but anyway that's not to distract okay so the first thing that yeah let me just think for a second so the first thing that I want to point out is I think there are two separate things here and I think part of the reason why it may be hard for you to move on from contemplative is because it's almost like either option is good but they're in the opposite direction yeah does that make sense because I'm sort of noticing that okay one thing one way so let's take a step back and talk about stages of change for a second you awesome PowerPoint by the way loved it um so oftentimes when we look at some someone's motivation and their ability to change Behavior what we've sort of discovered scientifically is that there are a lot of cognitive stages that people go through before they can take action and one of the biggest problems that people run into is that unless you understand where someone is in their stages of change certain things may work and certain things may not work so the simplest example so the stages of change model really developed with addictions and what we found is that people who were alcoholics for example telling them to go to an AAA meeting and get sober and stuff like that which is like the preparation and action stage didn't work if they were pre-contemplative which means they didn't know that they had a problem so giving someone Solutions like talking to a 15 year old kid who wants to be a CS GoPro and telling them that they can't stop they have to stop failing classes and they need to pass their classes isn't going to work because pre-contemplative they just don't think it's a problem they're like no I'm going to be a pro I don't need to study so the first stage is pre-contemplative which is when people don't have Insight or awareness that a problem even exists the second stage is contemplative which is now I'm aware that there's a problem but I'm conflicted about it so there's a part of me that wants to change but there's a part of me that wants to stay the same then we move on to preparation which is when someone is like okay I absolutely do want to change now we have to figure out how to change what's the best way my biggest issue with what you're saying snow is that I think your pre-contempt you're contemplative in two different issues that lead you in opposite directions so one is the value of money what is your relationship with money the second is whether you should have a job have a career change and burnout but it's almost like you're lumping those two together does that I think because the way I see it the career change relates to money because at the end of it it's about it's about like survival for me yeah I I understand I understand how they're related but do you see how it's kind of like so do you want to change your relationship with money or do you want to give in to your relationship with money and find a new career I think I think I want to does that does my I think I want to change with my relationship with money more a little bit more yeah but do you see what I mean like I understand how the two are related but like what you're conflict so you have two goals one is to change careers and one is to change your relationship with money right well for like changing careers it's it's like a secondary or it's like again it's what I think I should do because I mean I feel like the reality is that you have to earn you have to earn money to survive in this world unless you can like literally plant you know like grow every single thing you eat like you still need to pay for electricity and stuff so it's like actually like to be quite honest I don't want to work and I know that's a common sentiment but I don't know I feel like the career change is a little bit secondary well but my relationship went with money is so strong that it feels like it's it may be the thing I want to change more but it feels like it's going to be harder and longer to change that than to like you know just get a job again and have some income yes so let me ask you something if you change your relationship with money what would happen to your job or job prospects or future well I would be more relaxed about it because I'm like when I'm working to be honest I don't I get money and you would think that I would feel happy getting money but I don't feel happy and I also don't feel happy I feel very anxious when I spend money as well so I do think yeah that kind of needs to change okay I understand that so what I'm sort of so why don't you tell us about your feelings about money can you articulate that a little bit oh it's very complicated because I think maybe or maybe it comes across this way but like I keep talking about it so obviously it's very like important in some way to me or it's like weighing heavily on my mind but actually I think of it as like how should I say like I'm more towards the anti-work side of things I don't really like um capitalism I prefer like Socialism or or you know the ideals of like sure communism could have been or maybe the ideals of socialism like like I'm very idealist so I don't it's kind of like very ego this tonic um my feeling about money okay it's like I care so much about it damn someone's been doing their homework I care about it I said damn someone's been doing their homework yeah egotistonic stages of change uh so so tell me how do you feel about money Afflicted so what's the conflict like part of me part of me cares a lot about it anxious part of me I would say the fear can and can you tell us what the fear and can you tell us about survival and money and the fear yeah it's like I guess especially now because I've struggle um with depression and anxiety and stuff so it's like uh I just lost my train of thought yeah can you just tell me what you freak out about when it comes to money yeah yeah sorry um yeah it's like I've I freak out about like going bankrupt and like being homeless and like buying in a painful way yeah okay okay good I mean not good but but thank you for explaining that because that's what I'd assume but I think we just need to make sure so now let me ask you a question if you changed your attitudes about money and you are no longer worried about things you've got savings saved up for a couple of years you started chilling right you started to live this life where you're not working and like you don't have to figure it out right now because you're no longer paranoid about becoming bankrupt and homeless and dying a popper you with me so far how would you feel about yourself yeah I would feel I should say I do feel because like I honestly I'm like going back and forth I'm living back and forth like between these two states so I feel Edder I feel peaceful but there is still that I know there's still that anxiety like and sometimes that's the thing is like for me it's like I feel like I've been make I do acknowledge that I've made some progress um but my current situation is like strange and that I feel so like today I'm actually in a very good mood or like pretty positive like functioning normally I would say so I'm not in that depression where it's like you know six months depression like straight depression kind of thing I'm like it's strange because it's not even it's not even hypomania um I saw a psychiatrist and they said it doesn't qualify as hypomania but it's like I would say just a Level under where it's like within a month um I I'm like feeling positive like right now I'm doing things like going outside um you know like talking to my career counselor trying to like have informational interviews like working on things then I think like just some small negative things build up over time and I think I have a problem I don't really know how to like release it properly or if I'm releasing it properly or maybe what's an example of something that builds up like a very a small example that recently happens like I just saw some spiders in my house and I was like I was I wasn't that angry but I was angry about it and then it's like a couple of those small things where it's like and I I don't completely berate myself but I feel a little bit bad at like I don't know I was just angry about it so okay yeah I don't know but just those kinds of like small things yeah so snow I'm gonna I'm gonna go out is it okay if I kind of go out on a limb and make a couple of assumptions and try to do something that I don't do often which is potentially give you advice please yeah so I'm noticing a lot of different things the first is that it seems like the way that you process your emotions could be better especially when it comes to the piling up of small things okay so if someone has difficulty processing small emotional insults let's say or attacks what does that mean for their work situation if I have difficulty processing the frustrations and challenges of work on a day-to-day basis what's going to happen to me over time you'll burn out 100 percent okay so once you burn out then working is hard right yeah so this is where I'm going to say like I think it's going to be drastic for you to I'm not saying it's not possible but it sounds like you have a certain value for money and you have a certain idea of what you should be doing what's your ethnicity by the way if you don't mind me asking you don't have to answer if you don't feel comfortable with it but I'm just curious I'm East Asian okay so you so the reason I asked I suspected that and the reason that I asked is because oftentimes people from East Asian cultures will have a particular security approach oriented approach to money did you grow up in a household like that no I don't I think my grandparents yes but I didn't live with them that long but maybe I absorbed it like really absorbed it and don't realize that yeah it's possible right so like this is where we have to be careful about ethnic racial and cultural influences on an individual mind because just because you there have been studies done for example on Asian Americans and mental health where we can we can do literal research and discover that there are particular patterns that are like common to Asian Americans uh in in their mental health which are separate from the average American and also just because there are cultural patterns does not mean that those patterns translate a hundred percent to an individual does that make sense yeah so the thing is I don't know that you're ready to part with your security related to money what do you think yeah I think because I do feel that is quite a big resistance yep I know things logically like it's it may be worth it or it's probably worth it to like you know pay for therapy sessions again but like and I have I've had ex I guess the problem is also I've had experiences and all my therapy experiences so far have not really worked like with the CBT act models and even like myself um things I try to learn on my own um I think honestly like you're the most helpful so far but I'm still stuck yeah so that's yeah all right so I I'm sorry to hear that therapy has not been as helpful as it could have been I'm happy to hear that you've been able to find some help somewhere and also I think that maybe the way we're thinking about this is a little bit different so I I'm seeing a couple of different problems the first is that if if you can't process and it can't as a strong word but if emotional if you've made the observation which I think is absolutely on the right path that sometimes little emotional things pile up and you don't process them properly that will absolutely lead to burnout in the workplace now the interesting thing is that if you were to manage that and not feel burnt out at the work in the workplace the interesting thing about that is I think that could settle a lot of things for you I'm not saying that you should continue to work for the rest of your life even or that you should be a part of the capitalist system or whatever all I'm saying is that there's only one dumpster fire we can deal with at a time and right now what I'm getting the sense of is that in your life there's a Confluence of problems that are all hitting you at the same time so it's like now you're burnt out at work and you don't even want to work so it's now a good time so like one solution to being burnt out from work is stopping to care about money does that make sense because if I stop caring about money then I don't need to work and all the pressure's off and it's like I'm fine but that doesn't sound to me like it sounds to me like mentally checking out a little bit and I don't think that's actually like a healthy way to deal with burnout does that make sense yeah at the same time I do think that you've recognized that there are some attitudes towards money so I'm guessing that because you have this survivalistic kind of Bend towards money when you want something and you can afford it when you buy it you still feel guilty and can't enjoy it entirely yeah like if I because I bought some books and stuff and if I don't read it I feel like I didn't use it so it's like and I I can give up so easily like I'm buying things because of that yeah absolutely right so so so Independence of the burnout and work stuff even if you're working hard it sounds like you're not even able to enjoy the fruits of the capitalistic War Machine yeah right so like that's a separate issue which absolutely needs to be solved you need to change your relationship with money be a little bit more chill I think part of the problem though is that these two things I think are absolutely connected but I think they're artificially connected like the solution to burnout is not to stop caring about money does that make sense even though they are connected we can see how they're connected so in my mind I'm almost seeing two separate problems here Each of which needs to be solved it's just an issue of which one you want to tackle first and I wonder if part of the reason that it's hard for you to get out of the contemplative phase is actually because you've got two separate problems that you're linking together yeah like that makes sense and I do agree like I guess I have a problem with priority as well in terms of the two problems like is it what you were referring to before in terms of like basically the two paths I want to go on sort of right because what you're doing is you're you're I think both of these can be solved but they can be solved independently whereas what you're doing is linking the two and I think the problem is that when you link the two there's like two sets of values that you both hold that conflict pretty hard with each other yes exactly yeah and so I think actually what you can do is resolve both of those values but the problem is that the way that you set up the equation it's like there's losses on both sides yeah yeah and and I think interestingly enough sometimes that's normal for contemplative like if I want to give up alcohol there are benefits to giving up alcohol and there are losses to giving up alcohol right that sort of makes sense but in my mind there's like two actually separate issues burnout and your relationship with money I don't think the reason that you got burnt out was your relationship with money does that make sense yeah I can I can agree with that so then the question becomes if those if the reason you burnt out doesn't have to do with your relationship with money why are you trying to solve that by changing your relationship with money I guess so like originally I said that was the or just to me I felt like it's more important to change my relationship with money but I don't know like from what you're saying or not even what you're saying just like from what I feel now like and I think you mentioned yeah like maybe if I solve the burnout and like get back to work but also it kind of changed my mindset in some ways then it will set me up a little bit better to deal with the money I think so so let me give you a couple of reasons for that the first is like I don't know how to say this but if I have let's say a a complicated relationship with romantic partners some of that stuff I have to deal with on my own but I can't fix that problem by giving up romantic relationships does that make sense yeah like if I decide okay like I struggle in romantic relationships so I'm gonna be celibate being celibate may protect me from some of the stress of a relationship but it doesn't solve the relationship issues yeah so I don't know how to say this but all of your fears of survival and the security that money brings those are hard enough to tackle when you've got it if you're not working for two years and your bank account is shrinking month to month to month it's like an absolutely do or die situation you're like throwing a Hail Mary because either you figure this out or you're completely wiped does that make sense yeah like I'm not so in Asics yeah yeah so so dealing with an insecurity ideally should not be done by putting yourself completely at the mercy of the insecurity the way that you develop security is by actually being in a secure place and then tackling your insecurity it's not like throwing yourself into this insecurity headlong does that make sense yes yeah so what that means in terms of money is is that if you let's say you decide not to work again and you just chill for a couple years you could do a lot of intense personal work and you could come out the other side a very transformed person it's absolutely possible I think it's going to be a bumpy road and you may not come out the other side in the way that you want does that make sense yeah so almost what I would say here is you start actually with little stuff like emotional processing on a day-to-day basis and you really consider a career change and then hopefully what you can find is some kind of work that you find fulfilling and does not burn you out now if you need to take a break from work for six months or a year or whatever like I'd say go for it and the reason that you save and this is where even the money part of you that's paranoid we tell the money part of you hey the reason that we've scrimped and saved over five years is that if we needed to take a break we absolutely could and in order for me to find a career that is fulfilling and for my long-term Financial Security I need to take a break for six months to a year so you almost want to appease that part a little bit what do you think about that so when I hear that um part of me feels comforted so that's kind of why I'm crying but part of me the anxiety part of me like still kind of gives back like throws back on I don't know like retorts yeah good so you noticed that right so that's why I think it's gonna be really hard for you to overcome that while the daily pressures of unem being unemployed are pounding on you yeah so I'm glad you feel comforted because that's what we need to do right we need to not kick the part of you because the money part of you is actually looking out for you it loves you it cares about you yeah yeah and also we need to tell it that hey like sometimes snow needs a break we've worked really hard for five years doing something that we didn't really enjoy where we were suffering a lot on a day-to-day basis and we're kind of running on empty and we need a break for a little while I know you're afraid I know that you're paranoid that will become lazy and it'll be a gap on our resume and all of these other scary thoughts that it tells you right yeah yeah and then you can say like yeah but we're gonna just we need a little bit of space because the old way wasn't working and we're going to come back we're going to be recharged we're going to really think about what kind of career that we have that is fulfilling for us and provides us with Financial Security that's the end goal yeah how does hearing that make you feel to be honest like that is kind of where I was at but um I think what would help me in this situation because like what's really helped so far is you actually telling me like that like dealing with the burnout is probably easier like first of all should not be um conflated entirely with money and it's probably easier than actually fixing my relationship with money so on that topic like for the emotional processing because honestly I'm still very confused I've watched a lot of videos and stuff but like could you give me some specific he tells about like what methods I should use or like I don't know I feel like I am using some methods but it's not working as effectively for me yeah what methods are you using so so I've I Journal a lot um I was like I guess my question here is like is talking more effective like actually verbalizing um versus even Whispering or like journaling or like typing what do you think snow personal thing but for me I think like talking maybe I have to do some more introspection um or like analysis but I I feel like talking helps me more but it's actually like so hard for me sometimes especially when I'm depressed like I just don't want to talk at all sometimes okay has this been helpful today it has been helpful um but I'm aware or like I remember when like I felt like this with some therapy sessions before and like I kind of just fall into the same pit again so that's why I'm trying to ask for like specific steps for emotional processing I don't know because I honestly feel like I don't understand if there is a best way or like yeah I should figure out myself or like do you do you think we processed some emotions today I feel like I feel like the answer should be yes but I also might be Alexa thymic or like just partially and it's hard for me to like I don't know what it feels like to produce your emotions yeah so let's understand what happened today okay so I I'm also getting maybe a little bit of an insight into why therapy is quote unquote not been very effective for you so I said a couple things and then you broke down crying right yeah and then what happened what did you do immediately after that apologize I don't remember that but maybe you did oh I don't think you did anything wrong so then like we we like taught we were talking about all this kind of stuff and then like you're suddenly you sort of did a 180 on me and you were like I do you have any concrete skills for emotional processing and actually what was helpful was when you told me to do a b c d like when you told me like okay I need to work on emotional processing and burnout first so I think what's going on is that sometimes when you get close to emotionally processing you actually look for some kind of regimen or solution to do it instead of actually doing the work does that make sense so like right on the cusp of emotional processing your logical mind actually takes over so you step away from your emotional mind and you're like okay give me a logical plan to emotionally process and the moment that that actually happens you move away from emotional processing yeah okay is that sinking in or no no I understand what you're saying because I definitely like the word that comes to mind is optimization yes you can't good to keep going but like but then the problem is like have I I don't know because my question is then like I don't again it's like I don't know what I should be feeling if I've totally like followed it through completely emotionally processed like is it the cathartic feeling after crying is that like 100 or yeah so I I think I so I think if you get the opportunity to work with a therapist I think you should and I think what you should do with that therapist is so this is tricky but sometimes I've had patients like this some patients need to be given Solutions on the surface and then need the emotional processing to happen without them realizing it so this is the kind of thing where I think the the more you get closer to emotionally processing the more your mind is going to be like actually feels uncomfortable and then what happens when we feel uncomfortable with emotions is our logical mind is like let's optimize because optimizing is safe territory for you right you know how to optimize snow you made a PowerPoint whatever right so you had this PowerPoint ready you did your homework so like optimization being a good person in terms of doing your work and like if I give you an A B C D E F G and I say snow do these things you will do it until you are burnt out and you can't do it anymore right but what you want is like pushed all the way to the back and then you end up burning yourself out because you're so good at pushing yourself what you want to the back oh I want this I don't I want this particular shirt let's say or I want this bicycle and then what you want in comes your money complex and your money complex is like no no no snow we can't afford that we need this money for a rainy day so no bike for snow and then here comes a rainy day where we're burnt out we can't work look we saved all this money for a rainy day and your money complex is like no no no we can't actually spend the money for a rainy day on a rainy day we have to keep that in case there's a rainy day right so it's like I yeah maybe I was saving it for a rainy day but I don't even want to spend it yeah on the rainy day right exactly right so so it's like it's just it's weird because you've saved it specifically for this purpose now in terms of like what to do for you you know I do think that this is where there's like some concrete stuff about processing emotions so like journaling at the end of the day I think is useful there's a particular meditation exercise that we sometimes teach people which I can share with you today which is before you go to bed it's kind of it's kind of I guess is our meditation for the day but basically go back so when we start our day usually we feel pretty fresh and then as the day goes on there are all kinds of emotions that come up that aren't like worked through properly and so we get scared from the spiders and we have all these thoughts and then then we get distracted right before we resolve the problem of the spiders we get pulled into something else so that leftover emotion gets kind of like banked at the end of the day we've wound ourselves up and sometimes people have difficulty falling asleep because they're worrying about all this different stuff that's all banked up emotion that's been waiting to get out so there's a simple practice that you can do which is what I call the meditative rewind practice I think it's in Dr K's guide if you've had access to that but I can teach it to you now and it's basically you go back you start at the end of your day so if you're laying in bed and you go back you go backwards in time and go through basically each event of the day and as you go through each event of the day you acknowledge especially the emotional impact of that so for example I was brushing my teeth but my partner didn't put the cap on the toothbrush so the first amount of uh I mean on the toothpaste so the first amount of toothpaste that came out was all crusty and like dried out and I couldn't even brush my teeth with it and it was really annoying because they do that all the time oh my God and wow I I really got frustrated with them sort of acknowledge the emotion and then um kind of go to the previous thing so before that I had to do the laundry before that you know I had a a great piece of cake for dessert and that was really enjoyable before that and you basically want to go through all of your day and just acknowledge the emotions that you felt until you end up with waking up sometimes the practice takes five minutes 15 minutes 30 minutes for some people it can take even a little bit longer and that can be sort of like I it sort of like sort of starts you off with okay the day started I was pretty fresh and now I've like worked through like acknowledge for yourself that you've worked through a lot of what's happened today and now it's time to go to bed so so yeah I want to say I have heard of this before um I did watch it on the guide um but when you say acknowledge like you mean like do you mean kind of like what you just did saying it saying it in my mind and like in a in a calm manner but not getting hooked by the feelings yes exactly okay so so you'll feel some of the feelings come up right and you want to just notice wow that really upset me okay and it was just incredibly frustrating but then it is very good question so then you don't want to get caught up in it so remember the purpose of the meditative rewind practice is to be like somewhat sequential so then like if for example with the toothpaste example if I if my if I'm not careful then what my mind will do is be like I can't believe like I've told them so many times and they never listen and they do this and they do this and last time during my birthday they forgot this and then your mind is off all kinds of places and then it just ramps itself up yeah so you don't want to like engage too much but you want to kind of acknowledge okay wow like how did I really feel in that moment okay so actually like labeling it yes okay yes right so one of the so some of this stuff may go back to EQ emotional quotient and one of the key skills of emotional quotient is being able to identify your internal emotional state so that's a very concrete kind of thing that you can do it's a good meditation practice okay okay the other thing to just think a little bit about is you know if you want to take a break for a little while negotiate with the money complex and see what amount of time it can actually give you off if it's three months six months whatever maybe it's still 20 23 and then give yourself that time and then what I would really start doing is is thinking about you know what kind of work would you find more fulfilling and then hopefully also it's not just the work because I think this is what a lot of the anti-work people kind of miss is that there are absolutely crappy jobs out there but you have an influence in terms of how happy you are at a job right this is where like like the biggest problem with the anti-work movement is that they assume that jobs are completely static and part of the reason for that I don't really blame them for that because what happens is because of the nature of social media and stuff like that the most extreme scenarios rise to the surface so this the what everyone is reading about are the places that are terrible to work there's some places that are terrible to work some places that are amazing to work and the truth is most places are kind of in the middle where like most bosses actually want their employees to be like happy like most bosses are not you know capitalistic overlords it's been my experience maybe I've been lucky um but you know they want the job done but it's like a lot of bosses like I've had multiple bosses many of them care about me as people as like as a person I'll still reach out to them I have good relationships with them like those kinds of bosses exist so to think a little bit about okay what kind of career do you want to be in what what sort of work do you find like engaging and then also whenever you do decide to go back to work or when you try to look for jobs or whatever then start to really consider don't put up with crap just because your money complex tells you we need this job in order to survive right that's where you've got to start changing the way that you behave at work and that's where like so for example one of the things we found in career coaching is that what a lot of people benefit from is working out with a coach first of all what they feel at work that they're unhappy with and then practicing how to talk to people about it so that when you go and talk to your boss you don't come across as a whiny entitled employee you don't like you don't lead with your emotions right you're not like there are there's an eruption of frustration what it is is like going to your Boston like sort of having a nice like pre-prepared thing that's like hey this is something I found really frustrating at work this person in particular seems to like purposely I know it sounds kind of paranoid seems to be purposely like trying to make my life difficult and at first I thought am I just being paranoid but I've actually talked to these three co-workers who say that this person does the same thing to them yeah at this point I'm just trying to do my job I want to do a good job and these other three people are too but as long as this person is like sabotaging us not only does it make it frustrating I spend basically 60 to 90 minutes like like trying to fix this person's problems and when you frame things to a boss like that oftentimes the boss will like be on your side it's just about communicating things in a good way so I think there's a lot about work that you can handle yourself and what we also know about research from burnout is that burnout is a combination of individual things Plus work things it's not created entirely by work and it's not created entirely by an individual so the problem is that employers think that burnout is an employee problem employees think that burnout is an employer problem y'all should fix this because I'm burning out or mental health is your responsibility as as an employee so here's a subscription to a meditation app and hands off we're not going to change anything about the way that we work so the problem is that both sides are trying to punt burn out to the other one whereas in all of the interventions that I've done on burnout that have been successful it involves a shared responsibility just to give you one quick example of that so one place was you know called me in to teach meditation and I was like cool I'm happy to teach meditation when are we going to do it and they're like okay well their shift ends at 6 PM so you can teach meditation from 6 to 6 30. and then I said uh if you want me to teach meditation it has to be a part of their work day and they need to be excused of 30 minutes of work in order to learn meditation you can't make Wellness an additional burden on your employees um and then they were like okay fine and it worked out great surprisingly teaching 30 minutes of meditation did not impact productivity negatively at all people just got their work done in the same amount of time they just spent less time on like browsing on Reddit sitting on the toilet not working right anyway this is kind of a tangent but this just goes to back to this idea that burnout I think is going to be somewhat individually influenced and if you can manage your emotions at work and be super careful about suppressing what you dislike at work because money and security okay so I think I I feel like I still don't understand the suppression or emotional processing part but if I can if I can try to summarize and you can see if it's correct or not then sure I don't know are you laughing because I'm trying to rationalize this again or no I'm I'm laughing I'm sorry that that was I sometimes I wear my Expressions on my face I was actually appreciating how conscientious you are about learning foreign I'm glad that you asked if it made you a little uncomfortable because I think it's awesome you're a fantastic student oh God I think I lost my kind of thought but it was something about rationalizing you are gonna try to summarize emotional processing and suppressing emotions okay let me think sorry so yeah so I guess my takeaway is that I may have thought I was emotionally processing when you know like was kind of either living the emotion or even I I may have been able to notice it which sounds like that's the right path to pressing it may have come in when I started to rationalize to early so I I guess like it's just like I understand the stuff about doing it at the end of the day especially if I haven't had time throughout the day but like if I had time in the day like so I let myself be angry about the spiders like fully first because I don't want to get too angry like if I don't let myself get too angry is that suppressing it um so uh okay so letting yourself I don't know what you mean by too angry because that implies it sounds like that's suppressing so because you're using the word to which is the point is there's not like an appropriate amount of emotion right there's just you feel what you feel it's just what do you do with what you feel so do you let it control your behaviors do you let it control your thoughts or do you acknowledge it kind of notice it and then like the interesting thing about emotion that is acknowledged and noticed is that it tends to take control of you less the problem is that when we suppress emotion it actually takes control of us more because when we suppress it we lose awareness of it and that's how you get people who are like think they're super logical but are actually like behaving quite emotionally does that make sense I just have one question is that so in the past I have tried to notice my emotions and I guess the thing is because it didn't like in the way it worked because yes like if I feel myself getting angry and I notice that it does calm it down because otherwise I'm feeding into it but like you know by my thoughts but in some ways it felt like when I noticed it when it calmed down um it felt like that was suppressing it because it was going down I think that's wrong right well so I mean so that's where I I think you should figure it out but it so in the maybe the reason it felt like it was suppressing it is because you are probably pretty good at suppressing your emotions and so your primary coping mechanism for negative emotion is suppression and so the end result is the same the emotion goes down the question is is it coming back later in the case of suppression it's going to come back in the case of processing it shouldn't or it'll come back weaker it's so hot I guess it's really hard to tell though because yeah it's hard for me to tell yeah yeah so hopefully we'll have some kind of we may do a stream or something soon um I've been writing up a curriculum on emotional processing and originally this was slated to be for group coaching but we may stream a portion of it or something I don't know exactly what I'm doing with it but I've I've noticed that there's actually a need in the community that no one ever teaches us how to process emotions yeah that would be super helpful to get information on yeah so I just have to figure out how to break it down into steps um but I think for you snow a couple of like key things to remember is first of all you know I'd start with just being a little bit careful about trying to solve burnout by adjusting your relationship with money I think these are both issues that you're probably going to have to deal with in terms of figuring out how to work in a healthy fulfilling way I mean you don't necessarily have to if you you know if you really decide that's not for you that's totally fine but I don't think that burning out after four or five years of working is a good reason to leave the workforce I I mean I think it's good reason to leave the workforce then but I would not go completely off of working because I think that there's a lot of value to doing stuff that you find enriches the world and that's where I do believe that a lot of jobs out there like do create value for people and it's about sort of figuring out how you manage emotions to prevent your burnout and then hopefully once that sort of gets sorted out then over time once you've got you know once you're not dipping into your savings then you can start to develop a really healthy relationship with money I don't know I'm not asking for like a full thing but like you just have any like quick or is it is it possible to have any quick tips on developing good relationship with money like just a Direction um I think a lot of it is uh is somewhat similar to stuff that we've covered before in the sense that I think first of all acknowledging that that part of your mind is looking out for you it's not a bad guy that needs to be conquered so it's almost like trying to reassure it without giving in to it that's really the goal right is to notice that okay like you really are looking out for me but we have four years of savings or two years of savings I can actually afford a bicycle right like if I go from two years to 1.98 years of savings yeah that's okay and like I deserve to be a little bit happy and one of the things that money is absolutely there for security yeah and money is also there to like help people feel happy and that's where I would even think a little bit about being like concrete with it so like how much money would I have to save in order to feel secure and sort of just really thinking through things like that okay yeah because I thought or like it's so hard like I cannot put a number to it or it would be a really yep like a high number uh maybe I it sounds like I'm doing the right thing in terms of like acknowledging that like I do recognize that it's actually trying to protect me so it sounds like I should keep doing that um it's not like that is the right thing to do yeah so I I also get the sense that you know you've I mean you've come a long way from it sounds like where you were because even even today you're sort of I I think like you mentioned you're contemplative right so you've moved out of pre-contemplative into contemplative so you acknowledge the advantages and the disadvantages of your relationship with money and that's that's actually huge so I think if you just kind of keep at it for a while and also like some of that work is easier to do you know you can't it's easier to learn Detachment from food when your stomach is full it's harder to learn it when your stomach is empty yeah yeah exactly good so it sounds like that's yeah so good luck to you snow any last questions before you wrap up for the day um no I guess there was that meditation um I was just curious about like mantras like would you recommend any for me or just go with like the OM chanting let me think about that for a second um are you uh uh do you participate in any kind of religious tradition snow not actively by identify with Buddhism okay so I think I do have a general recommendation it's just not something that I can teach you so I feel like um if you can get access to someone who can teach you a Lakshmi oriented Mantra I do think that would help you could you spell that out for me yeah l-a-k-a-s-h-m-i -k -s-h-m-i okay so if you're in the Buddhist tradition a lot of the traditionally Hindu gods will have Buddhist counterparts or versions so there may be some kind of bodhisattva that is in the same direction is Lakshmi the problem is that most of my spiritual training is not from that tradition so I can't teach that to you but I feel like that's probably what you need well would it be harmful if I or it's I understand that you can't teach it to me but like if I found like I'm trying to say would it be harmful if I did that specific one and not like a Buddhist counterpart no no it wouldn't be it wouldn't be harmful it's just if you if you're leaning towards like so for example like if you go to a Buddhist temple and there's a Buddhist monk there you could go and ask that bud this monk do you know a Lakshmi Mantra or know anything that's similar to a Lakshmi mantra okay does that that's that's what I mean it will it wouldn't be harmful but I would definitely recommend learning from an actual person who understands this stuff if you can like you can Google a Lakshmi Mantra but yeah I don't I I've noticed a difference between people who Google mantra's enchant them and people who are taught mantras by a specific person got it okay cool thank you so much you're very welcome take care of snow good luck bye all right so a lot of stuff to cover there I think it's um I think snow was a great example of how a lot of stuff that's happening in the world right now can intersect right so if I if I want to develop a healthy relationship with money that's sort of like a personal quest in here but then that can you know developing a healthy relationship with money can really intersect with work related burnout and sort of like capitalistic socialistic whatever like work environment kind of stuff and the interesting thing is that you know as we go through personal conflicts and we have personal challenges at work sometimes what happens is we externalize those to broad-scale things and I think that that's it could be healthy up to a point like it's important to understand trends that are going on in the world at the same time we've got to be a little bit careful because when you sort of say I am unhappy with my job and the reason that I'm unhappy with my job is a capitalistic Society that may be true but it leaves you with very little actionable stuff so in medicine we've got this really interesting principle which oftentimes patients don't understand which is don't order a test unless it's going to alter your management so we never order tests or Imaging or anything like that just to know we only order stuff if it's actually going to change what we do so if I have a 90 year old woman who may have uterine cancer but they're not going to be on chemotherapy and they're not going to go to surgery there's actually no point in ordering the test because it's not going to change what we do right so that's common thinking obviously if the patient really wants the test and wants to know for other reasons and that's a different story but generally speaking we want to focus on things that are alterable the tricky thing with a lot of this like anti-work sentiment is that there may be alterations like maybe you need to change who you vote for and go vote and stuff like that that I think is all fantastic but we also have to be careful because sometimes there are things that you can do to affect how burnt out you are at work and we're not suggesting that and this is where the employers get tricky because what they'll say is that a hundred percent of the burden is on you if you're burnt out it's your fault in my experience and actually the literature supports this if you look at mozlok's original research on burnout it's sort of an intersectional problem right so it's it's the connection between a person and a work environment that creates burnout so that's where there's some stuff that you can alter and some stuff that you can't and that's where like you fix what you can and if you're still unhappy there and your workplace can't accommodate the rest or aren't willing to accommodate the rest or whatever then you should consider finding a different job or whatever but I think what we've really discovered is that there's a lot that you can do in terms of how you communicate to your boss altering your schedule changing you know setting healthy boundaries like if your boss texts you at 10 pm don't answer and they're like hey I texted you at 10 pm you didn't answer on Monday morning you say yeah I'm sorry I I was confused am I am I supposed to be working at 10 pm on a Sunday night you can ask them is that an expectation and that's where you know like if they say yeah like obviously like you need to be available on your phone 24 7. you can say okay I understand that so currently my contract has this amount of work over this period of time listed so availability 24 7 how does that affect like compensation just ask right they're like oh like it doesn't if you don't like it you can leave and if your boss responds to you in a way like that you could say okay thanks for clarifying I appreciate it and then you can start applying for other jobs and then you know you'll a week later you're like by the way I'm leaving when are you leaving I'm leaving tomorrow how can you do that to me surprise Pikachu face oh well you said if it didn't work for me I should leave so I it's not working for me so I'm gonna go surprise Pikachu face right and then they're like no but like and that's where you could say look I I'm confused I you know you're not going to be angry you so you're just like I'm confused we talked about what my I was hired to do one job you asked me to do something else I asked about compensation you said it wasn't available you said that if I didn't like it I should leave so I'm leaving and and that's it's not people are being passive it's not passive aggressive it's just setting a limit and sticking to it you don't want to you're not punishing them it's just okay these are the terms of work and that doesn't work for me so that's that happens sometimes anyway we're getting off track but the key thing here is that sometimes you know personal stuff like my relationship with money can kind of connect with work related stuff and that's where I do think that snow was a really good example of demonstrating how if you do a lot of emotional suppression it's going to lead to burnout and that's where sometimes if I feel a certain way it's not necessarily that the job needs to change it right some of that is just emotions that I need to process that like you know like it's a frustrating job like even if you work in medicine which is a sort of a good place to work generally we it's bad in some ways but good in other ways there's still just a lot about the job that can be incredibly frustrating and that's what happens with jobs is like no job is perfect and so managing that kind of stuff and like even communicating to your boss like in a healthy and productive way about what your needs are what your limits are what you're trying you're trying to understand the rules of the game and stuff like that that's all stuff that's really really important to do so I think sometimes when we really look at career oriented stuff we don't realize that there's like a personal component to it and that's actually why we developed the career coaching program but you know is because we sort of realized okay like wait a minute this isn't just about negotiation tactics because everyone's like okay here's a book about negotiating where it's like hold on you need to understand how you feel a little bit first because a lot of times what gets people into trouble is like untempered feelings at work right
