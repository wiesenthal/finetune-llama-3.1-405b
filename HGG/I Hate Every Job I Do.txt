at first i thought that i would fall behind on my work if i slowed down but i realized that this quota was not something given to me it was something i was giving myself what do you go by friend yeah my name's nick you can call me nick nick pleasure to meet you nick yeah you as well how are you feeling today nick i'm feeling great uh my life kind of feels like a a stream that's damn has been opened and still a few rocks left there but i'm flown in the right direction can you tell us about that yeah um i've been struggling a lot throughout the past year or two um a lot of mental health stuff in and out of therapy but i'm starting to feel like my puzzle pieces are coming together slowly yeah so i'd love to hear what what do you think opened up the dam um honestly a lot of introspection i kept thinking that problems were on the outside rather than being on the inside can you give us an example of that yeah i i kept thinking that so i kept skipping between jobs because i would always get super burned out of these jobs and i would always think oh these jobs suck every job i work sucks i'm never gonna find a job that i like but i started to think maybe it's maybe it's me and and how did you how did you start to think that well if every job sucks i'm sort of the common denominator there aren't i well or all jobs suck true that wouldn't be too fun but yeah it could be an option and what did you discover through that process of introspection what did you what did you discover about yourself that you know what were you bringing with you to each of these jobs i was sort of it basically came down to the fact that i always rush myself can you tell us about that yeah i i kept doing work at an absurd pace and it wasn't work burning me out i was burning myself out that makes any sense yeah it makes a lot of sense usually i mean that's very common so do you have a sense of what it was that was causing you to rush yourself i think it has to do with how much the cost of things keep increasing the expectation that you've gotta you've gotta climb that ladder the second you hang on to it and you've gotta be everyone's gotta be the office star and if you're not then you're gonna get passed on yeah i mean so how did you start to get because i you know nick it it makes perfect sense when you say it but what i'm really struggling to understand is that you know noticing that or realizing that is such a big hard step for so many people how did that happen for you well so interestingly enough um you had introduced me to the idea of the doshas and when i saw what a kapha was i realized i am rushing myself in ways that i don't think i'm equipped for and if i sit back and slow it down a bit i can catch my pace a bit more so uh if i'm understanding you correctly you've you're a kapha trying to live a betha's life yes yeah that's and that's why yeah i've been you know and i had some issues with coffee and stuff because i had to keep myself going yeah yeah okay everything just made sense for me yeah yeah that dude that's classic man right it's so cla i'm so happy for you oh my god yeah um so how are you how are you doing with work and stuff now i i've slowed down things i you know i get my tasks done slower but quality is increased exponentially okay so uh yeah perfect so nick can you explain to us what you want what kapha is and what resonated with you and how you decided to change it so let's start because like people don't know what that is right um so from what i can recall off the top of my head uh and you can correct me if i'm wrong here kapha is the the earth water dosha yep and their style of motivation is sort of a slow roll where you're almost like a a rock rolling down a hill and you have to gain your momentum over time yeah so just to give a little bit of context so generally speaking if we look at western science western science assumes all human beings are basically the same so if we think about even our model of disease like so we'll think about you know particular disease as being a discrete entity that exists outside of a person or a process so we know for example that that's how we sort of think about our model of disease but we know that for example from five factor research that personality is individual so we we've even sort of classified like individuality in some ways so one of the things that's kind of interesting is if we look at a lot of psychology we don't have psycho we have psychology of like personality but we don't look at personality is being a fundamental part of many of our psychological principles so for example we don't think about depression as manifesting differently in people of a particular personality type versus another personality type actually our our disease model and our personality model are completely separate right no one says anyway so if that sort of makes sense and so one of the key things about the ayurvedic system is that they don't separate disease from the person so there's no way to have a disease without some kind of person involved what that sort of results in is that the idea of disease and health is much more of an individual oriented process as opposed to like a classification that applies to a thousand people so one of the key principles of ayurveda is that there are three basically forces within our body that they sort of use elements to kind of describe aspects of these essentially personalities is what you can call them and the interesting thing about this stuff is that you know these are all sort of heuristics which means that they're tools for understanding but there isn't really a whole lot of scientific evidence that this is like actually exists so there's not like you know you can't biopsy someone a kapha and find earth and water inside them the key thing though is that what i've really found is that so some of the treatments of iron in iowa that have been sort of scientifically verified but the core principles there's very very we used to say that there was very strong genetic evidence actually based on criticism from our community in a thorough literature review that evidence exists but it's actually very preliminary and the effect size is quite small so these are like preliminary datas that show some indication that there's a genetic component to this stuff but it's far from conclusive that being said what we tend to find is when we talk to people like nick that there are a lot of people for whom this system of understanding can be transformative in terms of like how to understand yourself and essentially what what we talked about is that there are um you know depending on what your primary dosha is you have a particular like motivational style and so nick is a earth water type so much like an earth water pokemon he's kind of like tanky and he's resilient but it takes him some time to get started and oftentimes if you try to like push yourself too far you can kind of burn yourself out and generally speaking most of our what we think of as being successful is like the fire type which is like driven ambitious like we think of ambition as a flatly good thing we don't realize that you don't have to be that ambitious to be very successful professionally like it's not necessarily that you need to be ambitious you could just care a lot about what you do that's not necessarily ambition so a lot of these assumptions that we make about what it takes to be professionally successful but the key thing about this ayurvedic motivational style perspective is that if you understand yourself you can start to adjust to your individual personality and then hopefully if you're like nick you'll stop burning yourself out and start to feel like happier at work was that did you do that make sense nick what do you think yeah okay perfectly so you said you started to slow down a little bit were you afraid that that wouldn't work yeah uh at first because that's a risk you know can you tell us about that experience of slowing down yeah i i have to constantly remind myself to not rush myself because it's almost second nature to try to keep up as it were and it's tough to struggle to slow down in a world that keeps wanting us to go faster and faster as things change uh do you know as expectations increase it seems yeah so i i don't know how else to say this than nick but like i mean like how do you do that because aren't you like paranoid that if you don't speed up you're gonna be left behind well i don't i don't really think that i can be left behind necessarily i i just feel like at first i thought that i would fall behind on my work if i slowed down but i realized that this quota was not something given to me it was something i was giving myself it might be a little different if you actually have a work quota yeah being joining i think it's interesting how many how much people take on responsibilities at work that are actually not assigned to them yeah that's that's something i i learned i that i was all this this big work that was getting thrown at me that was burning me out was was me that was me doing that yeah so we see this a lot we recently launched a career coaching program and one of the key parts of our career coaching program so a lot of people think it's just like okay how do i get promoted but a big part of our program is that we focus on like the individual so what are a lot of the expectations that you're putting on yourself or how does your ego manifest at work in terms of signing up for things you know wanting credit feeling like other people outshine you and so if you feel like someone is outshining you at work you'll work harder to get credit but there's a difference between feeling like other people outshine you and people actually outshining you and so there's that individual component that i think a lot of people sort of lose in terms of like career advice we sort of assume that what our mind produces in terms of assessing a work situation is accurate which is a huge problem yeah yeah my brain was not being accurate with me that's for sure yeah so how did you learn how to slow down well i and this kind of came to me both through self-introspection and therapy but realizing that these quotas were on myself i i had to take that leap where okay well what if i what if i didn't move so quick um what if instead of multitasking i focused on one thing at a time and it it took a lot of it took some time for me to accept that it was okay but also being open with your co-workers your supervisor that you work at a different pace was something that i did with great success just letting people know that hey i do really good work but i have to take my pace awesome so that that sounds like something that a lot of people would have trouble doing is letting your supervisor know hey i have you know this is sort of how i work the best and notifying people of that so it sounds like you're doing great nick yeah i i'd like to think so that's awesome dude thank you so much for calling in and stuff anything that you want to talk about in particular or any questions you have um i don't i guess just how to be a positive light with others that are having a good time without being i guess the word they use is toxic positivity help me understand because i yeah go ahead yeah so i like to think of myself as a positive guy when i'm with people i'm all i'm always the optimist but i don't want to come off as undermining their issues because some people take that positivity as saying that their concerns aren't real or you know it kind of when people say if i say something positive and they're like oh thanks but i'm cured you cured my depression with your words and they kind of take it as an affront yeah and and what what kind of stuff would you say i i kind of would just be there for them and say hey that that really sucks but you know things can be temporary okay so i get as an example yeah so that may not be you know i recognize that that was potentially an artificial example so let's i'm to give you one very practical tip nick and then one more global tip which i think is more aligned with where you are so the first is if i say yeah it sucks but things are temporary what is the meaning of the word but in that sentence uh like it's kind of downplaying in a way yeah nick i i think you're a great guy but but yeah but i think you're not you know like yeah okay so the first is i'd eliminate but from your vocabulary when you're trying to be empathetic that's like it's like one of the best tips i can give you so literally when we train to become therapists we remove the word but from our vocabulary like i almost never or i use it very intentionally okay so if you're trying to get someone to see the other side of a coin don't use but use and and okay the other thing is that i think you take it for granted how far you've come and to recognize that a lot of people who are suffering are like not where you are so kaphas tend to be uh more imp like they tend to be very understanding and very resilient and so i think you've just got to realize that like this is like you know telling a 15 year old who's never had a girlfriend that they're gonna be okay and their decent chance that they're gonna get married and have kids and all that kind of stuff they're gonna get laid one day they're just not they're not ready for it right they just don't understand that like they just can't understand that and so what i'd say in terms of the positivity is like lead by example instead of explanation you know and and that's where like don't don't try to create expectations for them in the future where like they'll come to you but i would i would almost be like more stable as opposed to like pulling them or pushing them in a particular direction so just slow it down the way that you have it work right you don't need to inject them with hope right this second i get you so j just let they'll come to you and so so that you know like what'll happen over time you were you're sort of saying like how do i share my positivity with others without it being toxic and that's like the way is that that you if you want to be a positive person it's not something you do to other people it's not like hey take my positivity hey positivity positivity positive that's when it becomes toxic instead like if you want to be a light in people's life like you just you just shine in your own way right and don't try to like point it it's don't be a spotlight just be a light bulb and let it be like relatively diffuse and then they will come to you they're probably sensing it to begin with which is why they maybe come to you with their problems but then just like let them sit in your general vicinity and kind of just you know slow it down a little bit moving too fast wanting to help yep yep right so i think you're you're trying to get you're trying to catch them up to what you've learned i have no doubt that you believe like you you're able to see both sides of the situation right but like that's hard for a lot of people so like just slow it down which you've already learned so lean into that yeah all right all right cool man all right take it easy take it easy buddy you you too i'm really happy that you're doing well and thank you so much for sharing i think far too often this community becomes i don't think we realize because we reach out to the people who sometimes need help that you know there are a lot of people in this community who are actually doing really really well and like benefit from what we do here and like they actually just do okay that's kind of like yeah yeah you know yep so i'm i'm hoping to help some gamers become healthy gamers that's awesome dude and i think you calling in today and just sharing your story and your perspective is a fantastic example of just radiating whatever you are awesome take care man yeah you as well you
