and so this is where it's kind of interesting because we have to sort of acknowledge that and at the same time recognize what the impact of the internet on our mind is is anyone else experiencing anxiety because the state of because the state of the world right now i've been getting these really anxious and bad feelings for seemingly no reason these past few weeks my chest is so tight and i can't seem to breathe my colleague also had a panic attack last week on the same day that i had mine i feel like the current con ukraine conflict mixed with the roe v wade bill being overturned and the fact that it feels like all the progress humanity has made is being backpedaled in terms of human rights and fascism being on the rise i genuinely feel like everything is hopeless emotionally logically i know we can overcome any hardship and that i'm lucky i'm not in the ukraine or even the u.s for that matter but this feeling of absolute dread just won't go away and i don't know how to get rid of it no matter how much breath work or meditation that i do so this is an increasingly common experience that we're having so the world appears to be changing right so like we like if you kind of look at the book of revelation in the bible they talk about like all these signs that the world is ending and i'm sure that this is in other religious traditions as well but like we're checking a lot of those boxes you know there's like plagues and fires and floods in war and and if i remember correctly the antichrist is someone who pretends to be religious and everyone's gonna think that they're the good person but they're actually the antichrist so it's like sort of like a false prophet don't quote me on that it's been a long time since i studied the book of revelation so it sometimes seems like you know the world like is straight up ending and like things seem to be moving in the bat in a bad direction for every step forward we take we take one step back right there's war over here the economy is screwed inflation is an all-time high 52 percent of people who are living who are between the ages of 18 and 29 now live with their parents and the number seems to be going up every year rent is hard to pay you're like 30 years old and like at this point you were supposed to no longer have roommates right like and so everywhere you look it seems like something is really bad and things seem to be getting worse and then some of us are really awesome about it because what we're actually doing is like we're we've been told okay like breath work meditate like meditate your problems away right and there's definitely a role for meditation but no matter how much meditation you do it doesn't seem to be sufficient so if you're someone who's looking at the world and it's not just that the world is going to hell it's that you were affected by this like even if there are things happening in different countries or on different continents you are experiencing a panic attack and so how the hell do you deal with this like it's one thing to have a panic attack because your specific life is falling apart it's another thing to have a panic attack because of crap that's happening half a world away and i'm meditating so it's like what what are you like how do i what do you even do about this kind of situation it's like what how can you stop the world affecting you in in such a profound way now there are going to be a lot of like simple things that we're gonna talk about so people may say just spend less time on the internet i don't know if you'll know this but spending less time on the internet is really hard and getting and it's getting harder every single year that goes by right and why is that why is spending less time on the internet being becoming harder well let's think about that the first thing is that the internet is like literally infecting more and more things in your house so like i recently saw at someone's house a smart fridge so now not only can you hear about the war in ukraine on your phone and on the computer and on your tablet and on the tv but now every time you go get a midnight snack there's some bulletin about the war in ukraine on your fridge now it's even on the watches that we wear oh my god i have a smart watch so now i can hear about the war of ukraine here i can hear about climate change right here i can hear about roe v wade being overturned and you know soon if we don't have it already we're gonna have smart showers right and so we're gonna have smart toilets and everywhere we go it's going to be like there's going to be more access to the internet more access to the internet next thing that's going on is that the internet is getting like more engaging and addictive because people are figuring out okay if i increase the volume of ads people will pay attention more so like the internet is like invading our lives so we're letting it in half the time and the rest of the time it's like invading our lives and so this is where it's kind of interesting because we have to sort of acknowledge that and at the same time recognize what the impact of the internet on our mind is so let's just understand this kind of from a physiologic sense okay to begin with so we have this system in our body called we'll call it the stress system right so it's it's the hypothalamus pituitary adrenocortical axis so this is where we have this part of our brain called the hypothalamus then the hypothalamus sends signals to this part of our brain called the pituitary gland and the pituitary gland secretes a bunch of hormones and it secretes a hormone called acth and acth travels to our adrenal glands and activates our stress system the stress system was designed to be a short-term system so it's like most of the days i'm like out you know looking for like roots and berries and then occasionally i'll do a little bit of hunting if i see an animal trail and then sometimes i'll run across something like a cougar if i'm in the u.s for example so like a mountain lion okay and if i see that kind of thing i get my stress system activates but generally speaking the stress system gets activated for brief periods of time and has a sustained effect so what we tend to see is that the stress system okay so let's like understand this the stress system activates short term so in the first five minutes we get adrenaline i mean adrenaline takes seconds to release and then sort of like you know 20 minutes plus we get cortisol and then cortisol kind of like activates for about 24 hours okay so generally speaking the stress system activates and lasts for about 24 hours and the goal of the stress system is to keep us alive for 24 hours so what we're going to do is short-term survival is greater than like long-term health it's like an all hands on deck kind of situation so one thing for example that the stress system does when cortisol activates is it causes muscle breakdown for energy for immediate energy so let's just think about that for a second so like if i have a muscle that is a certain size i'm gonna i'm gonna actually break down ten percent of that muscle tissue so that the rest of my muscles have sufficient glucose and energy to be able to run for an hour if they need to so this stress system was sort of designed to be activated for brief periods of time and then like sort of get deactivated now what happens with technology is that our stress system is being constantly activated so technology what does the internet do okay there's the war in ukraine and for days and days all we hear about is the war in ukraine war and ukrainian war in ukraine and then what happens is someone on on a news desk someone somewhere realizes okay the war in ukraine is no longer emotionally engaging what does emotionally engaging mean it means activates the stress system those two go hand in hand so let's come up with a new thing to get everyone engaged in watching more so they come up with something else and so roe v wade was overturned recently so everyone's talking about that everyone is stressed about that that's everyone's gonna be stressed about this for a couple of days and then something else will come along that will be emotionally engaging so not only is technology infecting all dimensions of your life but all of the news sources and outlets and social media websites and things like that are all competing for your attention and they'll do whatever they can to get you to click on their stuff so what this sort of means is that our stress system is being activated on monday on tuesday on wednesday on thursday on friday etc and so if you have something like a panic attack what's going on there well the first thing is if this if you have a panic attack you have to be a little bit careful at assuming that it's just because of everything that's going on in the world you should definitely get a clinical evaluation but when we're in this high stress state one thing that we know about a panic attack is that panic attacks are not generally speaking mental so a panic attack is a physiologic response and one of the hallmarks of panic disorder is that oftentimes they don't even have a trigger so if you really look at the the diagnosis of panic disorder which is a dsm-5 diagnosis which clinicians will use one of the key things about that oftentimes really confuses people is we'll see posts like this where someone is like i have a panic attack because of what's going on in the world and you've got someone else who's got panic disorder who like is walking their dog and is not stressed about anything and boom they have a panic attack so it's a physiologic thing and so as we activate our stress physiology because of our technology exposure we sort of move ourselves in the direction of something like a panic attack so what do you do about it so i'm going to start with the concept of diet so here are three things that you can do if you find that the world is despairing or the world is like going to hell and you don't and it's affecting you personally and you don't know what to do about it okay and so the other thing that i just want to mention for a second is that so there's a great quote by krishnamurthy i may get it a little bit wrong but he basically said being well adjusted to a sick society does not make you healthy and i think that that quote is so so relevant today so what's happening is we're having to adapt to a society that is getting worse and as we adapt to a society that's getting worse we don't end up actually as healthy we adapt to our circumstances but we suffer because of it so here are a couple of things to really think about in terms of how to address this the first is we're going to talk a little bit about diet okay so if i eat like cheetos and pizza and drink beer or soda all day long day after day week after week month after month year after year what is going to happen to my body right so depending on what i put in i'm going to see changes right so i'll basically like pollute my body so what you'll see is all kinds of problems like you'll see you know decreased energy kind of sluggishness i remember this very well in my days of ordering chinese takeout you know just huge amounts of chinese takeout so i could reduce the cost of the delivery fee and then sort of have all this food piled up so that i didn't have to leave my room and i felt low energy sluggish felt bad leaned on unhealthy coping mechanisms also started to feel angry at like all kinds of things outside of my control right so this is what happens when you sort of pollute your body as your body starts to like not necessarily malfunction like it will eventually over time if you do it over and over and over again right you can cause damage to your body but depending on the diet that you put in you're going to get a particular kind of impact so what is our information diet what do we consume in terms of information so like these things are happening right it's not a question that these things are happening it's not a question hi yes okay where were we all right so what is the information diet that you're consuming so like as we put certain things in our mind our mind will start to react emotionally as it reacts emotionally we will start to activate our stress system as we activate our stress system we will move in the direction of something like a panic attack okay so this is where i want to share with you all something so this is like so you need to basically control this system in a couple of different ways so one is information leads to activation of the stress system which then results in increased energy right because you get ramped up does that okay hold on let me just move this up okay this is going to result in increased energy and when our mind has a bunch of energy we result in increased anxiety so if you think about anxiety and this is all like if you all have watched dr k's guide this will be old news to you so if we think about anxiety anxiety is too much energy in the mind does that make sense it's like your thoughts are moving really really fast so fast thoughts circular thoughts right it's like if you've got too much stuff in there and it can't get out now there's another kind of problem which is that as we look at the world like this what starts to happen is we get these are problems that feel unsolvable so the other challenge that we run into is when our mind comes up with a problem why do we have a brain that can understand problems to fix them so if we think about like even if if you look at a primate right so like let's say i'm a chimp chimps understand problems they're like oh i'm hungry or it's raining or i'm thirsty and then they're able to like affect change to fix the problem that's the whole reason that we have feelings like hunger and thirst so the reason we have anxiety is to like try to figure out okay what are we anxious about so that we can fix it now the problem is that our brain evolved in a situation where there were not global problems so i even remember talking to my grandmother who grew up in a village of like 300 people in india and the outside world was like a myth to her no one ever left like no one had ever left on a country or been on an airplane i remember the one of the early not the first time i went but i i had this very vivid memory of some kid asking me in the village he was like you came here on an airplane and he was fascinated and i was like yeah i came here on an airplane it's the only way to get here and he was like an airplane goes really fast right and i was like yeah it goes very fast he's like how you know like goes like hundreds of miles an hour or whatever and he's like how do you not fall out i was like what it's like how do you not fall out of the plane if it's going because this person grew up in a village where the mode of transportation is a cart and the idea of an enclosed like thing that you don't fall out of like he thought that that airplanes were just open on the top and he just kind of sit down like a cart it's a great question but this is the kind of world that our brain evolved in it didn't evolve for a world with global problems which by the way are unsolvable right so if you're in the u.s and you're kind of thinking like okay roe v wade got overturned like what can i do about it and then you kind of look at the world and you look at like how everything is like you know popular vote stuff and gerrymandering and the political situation in the us is like all going to hell and so what can you do about it nothing and so then that what that sort of does is generally speaking the purpose of anxiety is to take action to correct the problem but this isn't an option so what we end up doing is just like bouncing back like into more energy and more anxiety and then as we can keep on consuming stuff from the internet this kind of goes in and the good thing here is that you can meditate here right so that's where meditation kind of comes in so how do we fix this problem the first thing to understand is that this whole cycle starts with this so what you need to do is go on an information diet now this is really tricky because the business model of the people who stress you out is to stress you out it's emotionally engaging stuff that causes people to click on things right so we even recently had a interesting uh post where someone was like i don't like y'all's youtube title titles because they're clickbait it's like yeah we play that game too right so someone once told me it's a very successful not one but several very successful youtubers i asked them you know help me understand like how i can help people through youtube and what one of them told me brilliant said you have to trick people into learning you can't tell them no one watches videos about i mean people do watch videos but like you have to trick people into learning that's how you if you want to help people on youtube you can't tell them you're going to try to help them you have to trick them into it um anyway so it was an interesting piece of information so this is where like like literally the amount of time that you spend in this kind of toxic information environment is going to affect your mindset so we can also look at this as in someone who um you know is in a toxic household so if you're in a toxic household and you have like a parent who's like constantly emotionally abusive the less time you spend in that household the better you will feel about yourself and what we're essentially doing is letting the toxicity in through all of our devices and so you result in something weird right and this person even understands this logically i know we can overcome anything i'm not even in the ukraine or the u.s this stuff doesn't even affect me but i have this feeling of absolute dread right so we have these empathic parts of our brain which we relate to the suffering of others and even though we're not directly affected by them as long as we're hearing about this stuff we're going to be affected by it so this is something that i think is under appreciated in terms of like motivation and we actually dig into this i want to just show you all this so this is the new guide that we have coming out so for those of y'all that have seen this before these are the old guides green blue and orange so this is the motivation guide and one of the things that we really emphasize in terms of controlling the mind and understanding how to like have a healthy mind let me try to find it not this wait where oh here we go it's over here so is an understanding of the indriyas or the sense organs so this is where your motivation is going to be heavily heavily heavily affected by your sense organs your state of mind is going to be heavily heavily heavily affected by your sense organs so in the same way that like if you think about you know going to therapy what happens in therapy you have a different kind of sensory input if you think about getting away from an abusive relationship right if you're dating an abusive dude and you get out of that relationship what like you're changing your sensory input being in a healthy relationship creates a different kind of sensory input so a lot of the state of our mind like i don't know how else to say this but if someone like you know someone you care about tells you hey you're a terrible person what is that that's actually technically sensory input that's what it is it's the impact internally of the sensory input but literally what it is is a sensory signal and so by cultivating the right kind of sensory input we can actually alter the shape of our mind so very practically what does this mean it's kind of simple but you know limiting contact to the internet so there's simple things that you can do so like let's look at a couple of and by the way on the guide we also sort of talk some about this right so we're going to go there's there's videos about technology habits and how to develop healthy technology habits we're going to give you all some of that information right here now okay so limiting contact of the internet so the first kind of question is uh first thing that you can do is don't take your phone with you in the house so what we'll oftentimes find is i'll sit down on the couch and i'll scroll through my phone and then i'll walk to the kitchen i'll scroll through my phone i'll use the toilet and i'll scroll through my phone i'll wake up in the morning and i'll scroll scroll through my phone i'll get into bed at night and i'll scroll through my phone so the purpose of the portability of the phone is it's fine if you take it outside right that's great so that you have a way to call people or communicate or whatever but don't carry it with you throughout the house one really really simple tip okay so it's fine to like if you want to read a news article and you sit down at your desktop or your laptop or whatever and you're like okay like now i'm going to look at the news or now i'm going to browse reddit so in order to control it don't take your devices with you so you have to actively stop the invasion of the internet into your life so second thing is like design designate time for internet usage because what's happening is it's like it's all over the place right and it infects every part like so it's i'm going to browse at it for an hour that's okay like i'm just going to designate it so don't let the internet invade the empty spaces of your life it's fine because we have to use the internet right like that's there's no way to get around it but be very careful about letting it fill in all of the emptiness and as the internet fills in the empty spaces of your life this stress reaction will increase okay so the same way that we have to control our physical diet we need to absolutely control our information diet second thing that we need to do is focus on the stress system now this person already meditates so that's fantastic there are some um uh you know meditation techniques so one a good example of this is nadi shudhi pranayam or alternate nostril breathing which we've been teaching for a while it's really interesting because this has a new name in scientific circles so i wouldn't be surprised if in the next year or two you hear everything about this thing called cardiac coherence breathing it's alternate nostril breathing so alternate nostril breathing is a great example the cool thing about it is since we've sort of come up with a new name and and medical science is culturally appropriated not ishidi pranayam what we're actually seeing is a lot of studies on it and the autonomic benefits of cardiac coherence breathing so autonomic is the system that we're talking about it's the stress system so we want techniques specifically that affect or are targeted towards our autonomic nervous system so this is where what we really want is bronium if you're talking about not just mindfulness and qigong are probably your two best bets for meditative techniques of which alternate nostril breathing is one basically we want techniques that focus on the length increasing the length of exhalation and this is the common physiologic element for reductions in in hyperactive reductions in hyperactivation of the autonomic nervous system so basically de-stresses you okay so you do want to meditate the problem is that you can only meditate so much and if your inputs are still super high like it's not going to be enough the third thing that we want to do is get this energy out because as long as the energy is bouncing around in our mind it it needs to be vented in some way so you can absolutely do something like see a therapist right so that's one way of getting out anxiety and things like that especially if you're having a panic attack you probably want a clinical evaluation but this is going to be kind of subtle but what i want you to do is take insufficient action really important so remember that part of our anxiety system in the brain is i have anxiety and the purpose of anxiety is to prompt action the prop prompting the action reduces the energy this is a high energy state right and so we sort of know that it reduces the energy and so what it does is it no longer loops out now we also sort of understand this in a couple of other ways because we know that something like exercise improves anxiety gets some of that energy out but when you exercise you're not fixing the problem does that make sense like if i'm anxious about some problem in the world like climate change and my anxiety is really bad and i'm on medication i'm doing cbt and all this other good stuff exercise doesn't alter climate change at all what it does is decreases my energy um this is an approximation right so this i'm using the term energy here as a is an analog for all kinds of different physiologic effects and what we know is that exercise will clinically reduce anxiety so what about this word insufficient so the problem is that if i'm anxious about let's say climate change what makes it hard for me to take action it's not going to be enough what's the point so here we are when we're anxious and what is the thought in our head what's the point it won't be enough and it's this thought this amount of thought of insufficiency if you want to look at politics everyone in the us especially has been complaining recently that our politicians are really really old right they're out of touch with the young generation young generation doesn't vote you asks a young person why don't you vote it won't be enough it won't do any good so what do you expect so if you're anxious and you don't take action that anxiety will continue to persist right so someone's in chat is saying i'm 22 haven't voted once since i was 18 i don't care too right that's your choice my point is that anytime we look at a problem and if we want to take an action that would somehow help almost from this angle the the what keeps us from taking this action is this thought it won't be enough so if i'm let's say if i want to get in shape and i feel physically unhealthy right and then like if i look at let's say taking a walk why don't i do it because my mind says to me it's not enough it's not enough it's not enough therefore you don't do it so the action doesn't get taken so what i want you to focus on is insufficient action if you want to transform your life the most important thing you can do is start taking insufficient actions okay take insufficient actions so if you're worried about the climate go and like plant a tree like you can plant a tree it's not hard to do you can grow a see put a seed in a little thing and then go put it somewhere right you can pick up trash in a public place clean up the environment a little bit and then you'll say to yourself oh but that's not enough that's not enough that's not enough but once you start taking insufficient actions you'll be amazed at what it does for you it works on this energy principle here right because now we're like sort of venting our mind we're physically active we're getting out of the house there's all kinds of things that taking insufficient action will recruit and then this is also where like over time you'll start to learn a couple of almost spiritual perspectives about like even if the world is going to hell i did my part right you can start to cultivate detachment i can't fix climate change but i did my part and this is the cool thing about the internet this is what we discovered here at healthy gamer through aoe this concept of aoe healing is that no snowflake thinks it's responsible for the avalanche because it's true right so take some kind of action whatever it is like it's not important what you take but just be careful about this insufficient part it's okay to start with insufficient actions and if you do three these three things if you control what is entering your mind through the control of of sensory input and then the guide for example will teach you specific meditation techniques to to help you filter what comes into your mind if you decompress your stress through particular meditation techniques like alternate nostril breathing and if you vent your high level of energy you'll sort of work on all three of these dimensions and hopefully it'll help you manage a world that appears to be going to hell questions someone's asking does your anxiety help with social anxiety i don't really get out much so the the anxiety guide is organized in basically two ways we talk about some clinical stuff in which there's a a particular sex section on or video on social anxiety but the bigger part of the anxiety guide is that it teaches you the nature of anxiety in your mind in a non-clinical way so we go over things like generalized anxiety disorder treatment perspectives and and stuff like that diagnosis of clinical stuff but the whole point is that it we teach all stuff like i mean i have the video right here i mean i have the thing so i can just show you so we'll also talk about things like you know evidence-based herbs for anxiety and things like that but i think the main thing that i like about it is that it teaches you like you know basics of anxiety 101 things like the effect of physiology on anxiety so this isn't specific to social anxiety but it absolutely applies to social anxiety we'll also teach you things like how we respond to anxiety in ways that make it worse and so like how we sort of like propagate anxiety by trying to control it and we'll actually talk about that we're going to cover that today in a post so we don't there oh when before i forget i mean there is a segment on social anxiety disorder but most of it is like the basics of like how anxiety works in your mind okay [Laughter] so um our terrible is asking any advice for how to disconnect consciously for content creators whose job description is to be chronically online 100 so we have a content creator program where we work we have a coaching program for people who are content creators and working with hundreds of content creators now we've learned how hard it is to separate because it's your job to be online right so that's where there's like all kinds of like important tips if you are a content creator or being online as a part of your job so one thing is you have to be careful about what's logged in where so there's even simple tips like you know when i log into my computer every day i use basically the same login for if i'm playing dota or if i'm streaming or if i'm reviewing like data from a research study so i use the same login but the the truth of the matter is that you can actually create different logins where like twitter is not logged in right or like steam is not visible or hard to access right so there's all kinds of stuff that you can do to like literally create dividing lines between work and like not work that's also where there are like other tips that we'll have which is that like so for example don't be don't log into twitter on your phone so if if really the purpose of twitter is to is work related then it should be logged in on your desktop and you manage your twitter as part of your job and but then you're like but if i'm not logged into twitter on my phone then dot dot dot yeah absolutely so there will be a price to pay if you are not logged into twitter on your phone the question is is the benefit worth the price that you have to pay so sometimes that also means creating separate twitter accounts right so separate your personal twitter account from your work twitter account um and i think it's like there's a lot of like limit setting which becomes increasingly more difficult if you're a content creator and there are all kinds of other problems as well like that content creators suffer from because they don't have good boundaries in their life by virtue of their job so another really classic example i know this isn't what you asked but it's something that we see time and time again and something that we've sort of learned which is not stuff that they teach you in medical school by the way which is like collaborations versus friendships so this is so hard for content creators because when someone is like hey do you want to hang out sometime is this a collab is this person talking to me because i have more followers than they are or are they my friend so like this this like the tension between personal relationships and collaborations because a lot of the collaboration success depends on the quality of the personal relationship it's like they don't get to have friends that are separate from work which is not exclusively a problem for content creators right it's just exacerbated or amplified but there are a lot of people whose social circle and professional circle overlap there are all kinds of challenges that content creators face which i think are actually relatively novel so some stuff that we sort of know if you look at like celebrity psychology but content creation is completely different because there's also all this stuff around metrics so another challenge that content creators face is how do you know when enough is enough when are you done editing a youtube video when have you come up with the right thumbnail should i spend an hour coming up with a thumbnail two hours five hours ten hours what's the right title for a youtube video should i spend an hour two hours five hours ten hours right so the nice thing about many jobs is that there's like a start and a finish like even as a clinician like i'm a psychiatrist i have appointments i have appointments scheduled from nine to five pm and at five pm i finish my last appointment and i'm done i'm done for the day but as a content creator even if you're doing something like you know making music right like when is the song perfect can i work on it more can it be better it's so challenging so many challenges that a lot of content creators have it's been an absolute pleasure to work with all these people and thankfully we've been able to help them substantially but it's it's really interesting how the mental health challenges that people face are evolving as our world evolves um okay great question how do we deal with the guilt of not being in touch with the news great question so what's wrong with not being in touch with the news why is that a bad thing right so where does this idea that it is your responsibility to read the news or you know follow the news what what difference does it make what is so i remember having a conversation with a family member of mine where they were like you should read the paper every day and i was like why and they're like so that way you know what's going on in the world you can't be a clueless noob and it's like what difference does it make if i know what's going on in the world or i don't know what's going on in the world like what difference does it make if i you know there are times where it makes a difference right so if like if for example like you're trying to figure out who to vote for then you may want to understand what's going on in terms of like foreign policy and like whatnot i'm not saying that collecting information is a bad thing this is where basically there was something else that i'll tell you all which is that if something is so important and so huge you'll hear about it even if you never watch the news or like consume the news in any way shape or form so i the the tricky thing is that that's a logical perspective the question is why do you feel guilty that's what's important to understand where does that guilt coming from am i being a and then like really like look at that critically is it appropriate to feel guilty where is this idea that i'm feeling because if you feel guilty you feel that way for a reason it's a valid feeling it may not be correct but it's valid you feel guilty because you were taught to feel guilty because somewhere along the way a value system was injected into you and you're not living up to that value system therefore you feel guilt so it's not inappropriate that you feel guilty because that's what you were taught it doesn't make it correct though and this is the subtlety between a feeling that's valid and a feeling that's appropriate right so like when when someone gets me a gift for example for my birthday and the value of the gift is a hundred dollars and if i grew up in a in a household where the value of gifts the price tag on the gift correlates with the love that you feel and so i look at this hundred dollar gift and i think to myself this person got my sibling a 200 gift screw this i'm mad at this person for giving me such a crappy gift that feeling may be valid based on your internal construction
