you want to be proud of your grades and if you're really proud of your grades it's like other people can be upset with it but when we're confident in ourselves other people can say whatever they want to and it won't affect us but what i'm hearing from you is like you're not showing your parents because they're still going to be disappointed in you because that's like it's not perfect which means they're not going to be happy hello yeah you can call me david okay nice to meet you david so i think the topic today is what do you want to be and what's getting in the way yeah so when i answered the prompt i kind of said that i want to be a lot of things there's like a lot of goals that i have in mind for life like i want to be financially successful socially adept someone that's generally confident kind of what people have in their head when they think of like a good person kind of like you know like a chat okay and and so what are the elements of a giga chad explain that to us david i guess they're like confident who they are they're financially successful at least in my head that's what i would think they're healthy they're generally have a good circle of friends they have healthy relationships they're secure in their attachments and in those relationships someone's been doing some homework securing their attachment okay and where are you in relation to all of this stuff i'd say i'm pretty far removed i i'm in university right now so i don't have a career per se but um i am pretty nervous because i graduate this year i'm gonna be graduating about eight months from now okay and i don't have like a career prospect i don't have like i haven't really put much thought into what i'm going to be doing you know i haven't applied to jobs i haven't done an internship but i haven't done any of that as like people my age i see them getting involved there they we have something in co-op called co-op where i'm from where your university helps you find a career related to your field and you work with them for a period of 16 months so four semesters and you graduate with like kind of your foot in the door you know whereas i don't have any of them i'm kind of just graduating so you didn't do co-op i just didn't have that option like it's not in my i see okay and and can i ask what you're studying yeah i'm studying something like it's kind of weird it's it's called graphic communications management but it's actually like printing like industrial printing but you can also go into graphic design or packaging and stuff like that okay um and so it sounds like you want to be a lot of things confident financially stable healthy social have secure attachment so it sounds like you're on track to graduate so i suppose congratulations or condolences i'm not quite sure i guess it's an achievement but i don't really like i guess i'm not very nice to myself in that sense i'm just like uh i graduated but yeah that's what you're supposed to do right like i haven't done anything special i feel okay so hmm let me can i think for a second yeah go ahead what about um health social stuff health wise i think i'm all right i go to the gym pretty regularly i have a routine and everything but it's not like i just do it because i kind of have to it's just like a duty thing right like you do it because you have to you don't do it because you want to okay and how is that okay that you do it because you have to i mean people always talk about how after you look up for a little bit it becomes a little bit addicting and you want to do it but i've never really had that like it it still takes like willpower and for me to do it which i guess is what i would call discipline does it feel like you're disciplined i guess in keeping with that routine yes but with other aspects of my life probably not how do you feel about yourself in in general yeah that's a tough question i'm not too sure some days it's like yeah i'm doing pretty alright i think i'm doing pretty well and other days it's like what the hell am i doing what am i like here for i don't i haven't done anything with my life you know okay when are you supposed to have done something with your life that's a good question i guess it just depends on who you are like i could look at someone that's my age like they're people in my age that are have signed like their rookie contract in the nba they're making six million seven million dollars a year whereas there are other people my age that are you know not in university they may be dropped out of high school you know maybe they're not employed or in education or anything so it's hard to say yeah so you bring up a really good point david that you know when are you supposed to be a giggy chad but i think it could happen at any point in your life right yeah so and then you also kind of pointed out that like i asked you you know when are you supposed to be successful basically and you said that depends on who you look at there are people i could compare myself to that are more successful than i am and according to you basically and there are people i could look at who are less successful than i am so how you're doing depends on who you compare to yeah so it's all like relative right yeah so i wonder if there's anything else like you know whether you're successful or not whether you're happy with where you are how you feel about yourself anything else that you could set that bar to as opposed to comparing to someone really successful or comparing to someone not successful at all maybe someone just like me like someone that's in university yeah someone just like you i like that idea who is the person who is most like you can we argue that the closer we get to you the better the comparison will be but i guess it also depends on kind of what objective you're trying to achieve with that comparison right good excellent what objective are we trying to achieve with the comparison well it's hard to say maybe to determine whether i'm successful or not excellent right so like we have to like if we're going to make comparisons let's try to make the fairest comparison right yeah so like you know if you're successful like what's your net worth like i'm i'm 21 years old and i run a 10 million dollar company that i started three years ago when i got a 20 million dollar investment from my parents and three years later it's worth 10. i built it you're going to compare yourself to that guy probably not right right at all yeah so how who is the closest person we can compare you to i would guess someone in the same program as me who doesn't feel too secure about their prospects after they graduate excellent and do you know anyone like that i know people who are nervous but i'm just like our situations aren't the same because you've had the opportunity to have like they've done an internship elsewhere they've sucked they've won out right yeah like on their own accord and i haven't done that how can we get to someone even closer than that someone that tried to but didn't or i guess maybe not even chat because i didn't try yeah so is there anyone that you know who's in your major that didn't try to get an internship etc etc well my situation is a little bit special i kind of had the option to do one but uh it's a pick and choose you can choose to do an internship for like three months or you can go abroad for international exchange i chose innovation you you chose what international exchange like an exchange program abroad in a different country for six months and how do you feel about that well i've already done it i'm glad i did it it's like a very transformative experience you meet like tons of different types of people and see how things are different like halfway across the world i went to europe and i'm from north america but i come back and it's like i'm missing that like kind of foot in the door now i don't have that that experience that other everyone else does right yeah so so i think what we're sort of getting to david is that you know the person you should really be comparing yourself to is yourself yeah probably right and and this this is where i think we've sort of discovered does that make sense like because as you pointed out like so our mind so let's take a step back you don't feel confident in yourself right you're like i'm doing what i'm supposed to at my age and when are you supposed to be a giga chad not yet but also i kind of don't feel good about myself even though you're kind of doing what you're supposed to be doing so and yet you don't feel great about yourself and then as you pointed out depending on who i compare myself to like when are you supposed to be what you strive to be like when are you supposed to be like confident financially stable healthy have a healthy social circle maybe in a significant in a relationship with a significant other sure as hell is not supposed to be eight months before you graduate i can guarantee you that i was kind of thinking like the earlier the better right why because that's kind of just life right if you're a morehead that's like life is probably better unless that's wrong i i mean if you're ahead what does what does that mean like having a good circle of friends around you a good support system developing those early getting into good habits like exercising etc is it a competition it kind of feels like one like it kind of does yeah just like a rat race kind yeah but is it i guess when you really think about it no but i think the world is set up in a way where it's kind of designed to be right yeah 100 the world tries to compare you to other people all the time because there are people out there david who are thinking to themselves oh my god i wish i was like david is david much better than me because he's exercising regularly and this guy is disciplined he doesn't even want to work out but he still works out and he's graduating and i dropped out of school what it's useless to compare right so this is where like i'd say a couple things the first is where you are i think is developmentally appropriate do you know what that term means like the way i see the world and the way i earn this appropriate for where i'm at in my old the stage i'm at 100 i do not expect a 21 year i mean uh i don't know how old you are but someone is eight months away from graduating from college to be financially stable have all their social life sorted out like what's the job of a college student uh studying kind of set their life up for success later in life sounds like you're exercising sounds like you're gonna graduate sounds like you've got some stuff to figure out what do you think i think i have a lot to figure out though i agree you have a lot to figure out how long do you have to figure it out it again it depends i guess figure out like no doubt does it not really nope literally how long do you have to figure it out like everything i guess i have my whole life absolutely the amount of time you have is until you die that's like literally how long you have to figure it out what do you think about that i feel like there's a good time and a bad time to figure things out i think there's like such a thing as figuring things out too late and which may put you behind which brings us to the whole thing about it not being a competition but it definitely feels that way yeah have you figured things out too late david has that happened to you before there are things that i know that i don't know that i feel like i'm behind on so what are you gonna do about it the easy answer would be to say figure it out but no one tells you how right good so how are you feeling about this conversation uh i'm not sure i don't know like kind of if it's going to change the way i see the world or the way i'm thinking what i'm going to learn from it yep i completely agree we're just a little unsure yeah so we're gonna we're gonna try to share something with you we'll see whether it changes things or not but i'm asking a lot of questions i'm i think you're giving all the right answers i think that this is where like maybe i can help you synthesize into a hypothesis that you're you've put together so david i think that there's some like there's advice that we give people right so like number one is don't compare to other people and what you've actually really done is given us a very good argument for why that is because it's sort of like you know there's no point in comparing your like because you're just not in that situation and if comparison is off the table because it's it's really like it's just useless like it's like if i heaven forbid at the age of 15 got into a car accident where i had a cerebral hemorrhage and lost a part of my brain like it's useless to compare myself to people who like that didn't happen to you know what's acceptable or not acceptable what's appropriate or not appropriate whether i'm ahead or behind you can look at anyone else and as you pointed out depending on your comparison you will be ahead and depending on your comparison you will be behind and even if you are ahead you won't be happy because it's because that's not where happiness comes from because you are ahead of some people right right yeah does it make you happy no so like let's say you started like working out more than you did or you have a gpa that's slightly better than another human being elsewhere on the planet is that going to make you more happy it might give me like a little bit of pride of knowing that i'm doing well and that i'm doing like i'm good at something but that will give you pride but doing well and knowing how to do something has nothing to do with comparison that comes from within yeah right so it depends on whether you're measuring up against like what you care about or whether you're comparing to someone else does that make sense because you're ahead of some people and it's not like you're 50 happy because you're ahead of 50 people like sure you can take every universe every university student in your school you can rank them and you can objectively be somewhere i you can do that but it's not like moving up five ranks or moving down five ranks makes you happier right right yeah so this is where i think there are a couple of things that we gotta sort of think about so then it's like okay so you're you know we're on this call and you're like okay so what do i do about it because i'm not confident in myself so that's why i'd say like number one is like you know what you should really like your confidence and stuff is gonna come from your satisfaction with yourself it's not going to come from outperforming someone else agree or disagree i i agree so like now we get to so how do you move forward from here like why are you not confident in yourself i don't mean that as like a deep existential question i mean like literally what are you unhappy with about yourself i would just say i'm just not happy that i haven't been able to achieve a lot of things that i feel like i shouldn't like what like i uh maybe these are out of my control but i haven't really made friends in university i was because covered virtual for two years i was i had my first semester in person and i kind of just like i don't know i've changed a lot in the last couple years i was a huge shut-in very shy didn't really talk to people had a lot of trouble with stuff like that and you've changed a lot in what way i think i can talk to people easier now like based on the fact that i'm here you know i probably wouldn't have done something like this a couple years ago do you feel good about yourself for that no but there are people that let me know that i should be yeah so that's kind of tricky right so like here you are actually like decently on your way to become a giga chad i wouldn't say that but sure i i am saying that right so i i know you wouldn't if you were saying it then i wouldn't have to and what do i mean by that like so you're gonna graduate from college sounds like you are one hell of a shut-in plus the covid pandemic and you're like growing like so here's what i see i see like what's happened into the level like what's happening to your xb bar david do you play games yeah i do what's happening to your xp bar it's going up right are other people going up faster or other people higher level than you sure but like your xp bar is going up that's why i'm confident that you're well on your way to become a giga chad now there's more to that more to it than that but basically what i'm hearing is that so you're graduating so that's one step forward in the financial standpoint confidence is like your confidence is not increasing despite the fact that you're getting better can we agree with that like objectively you're getting better you're socially better you're exercising every day people can't see you but you've got a nice head of hair you know so that's that's working for you so it sounds like you're healthy sounds like you're improving socially and you're also like here which actually indicates to me that you will this is a good prognostic sign because you're working on yourself intentionally this is one thing that most people your age don't do which is that they just kind of like afk instead of being like very intentional does that make sense yeah that does so and i think it's developmentally appropriate like i don't know how to say this david but at 2 21 i'm assuming you're 21 who knows but 22 20 whatever how old are you 20. okay so you're 20 and you're gonna graduate in eight months right so you're like technically you're ahead of the game because most people graduate when they're 22 right yeah what do you think about that does that make you happier i feel like i could have done better like oh i could have graduated in three years instead of four i could have if i really tried i could have graduated last year so now we get to why you're not confident okay so i'm going to ask you a question david when there is something you could be confident about what does your mind do to it yeah what's the word invalidates it very good right can you be proud of your you exercising regularly i could be but like my mind just tells me you should be doing this anyway exactly so like this is the problem it's not actually that objectively you're doing anything bad it's that anytime you have a win your mind doesn't let you record it in the w column it takes your double use and shifts them over to the l right yeah i get what you like isn't that weird yeah i honestly think i know where it comes from probably from my childhood shocking yeah tell us if you feel comfortable yeah so this isn't exactly childhood but this is probably the one that stands out the most in my mind uh i was 18. this was my first semester of college and i had i don't know how the gpa scale is in in america it's different here where i'm from but it's basically it goes from zero to four point three three four point three three is like the highest and anything above like 3.6 is like is like an a so during my first semester i had a gpa of 4.27 and i showed my parents because they wanted to see my how my grades are doing and my mom looked at it and i was like and she looked at the courses so they were like a few like most of them were 4.33 and then i had like one 4.00 which is like the next rate down and then she was like so you so you need to do better on this this is still bad and then after that i kind of just like i was a little bit disillusioned i was like okay i'm just not going to show you my grades anymore if that's all you're going to have to say and i haven't shown them since so okay so help us understand david because you know you're introspective and you've got an answer for us what connect these dots for me what does that story or how does that relate to you what's going on lay it out for us i guess i take what i've been told all my life and in my childhood because if it was happening then it was after poor as well and i've kind of internalized it what have you and what were you told and what have you internalized that i'll never be good enough what do you think about that some days it does feel true like there will always be always be someone better than right that is correct that is a statement of fact there will always be someone better than you i guess it shows through a lot of my personality like i always kind of want to be the best in things that i care about and why do you want to be the best i guess it's just something i've carried over from what people have told me sort of right so i think the reason you want to be the best is because then you'll be confident right if you're number one then you'll be happy then you'll be confident you'll have achieved you'll win the race and then you'll feel good about yourself with me yeah yeah now here's the thing you strive to be number one but every time you take a step forward what do you do with the w turn it into an l absolutely you're playing a rigged game you see that you're trying to solve the confidence by achievement but any time you achieve you move it to an l which is how we get someone so let me explain something to you okay this is going to sound kind of confusing so bear with me david i knew a guy once his name was david he was 18 years old started college got a 4.27 gpa he exercises was a social shut-in years later despite the pandemic is getting socially better is basically like doing pretty well in a lot of dimensions like has some rough parents and things like that man that guy is nothing to be proud of right because he ain't perfect yeah that sounds absurd when you say put it like that right so here's the tricky thing the one thing because you're doing a really good job we already said you're introspective you've come a long way okay you may not feel like it yet but hopefully i mean who knows we'll see we're gonna just do the best that we can today and that's all that we can do it's not like we can do better and it's not like we can do worse right and if it's not good enough it's not good enough so one thing that i want to point out to you about your story that really stuck out to me when your parents saw your report card and they said you need to do better at 4.0 what did you do in response i became like kind of apathetic and i rejected their response incorrect this is the growth point you didn't reject their response what did you decide to do physically you shared this with us i just stopped showing them my grades absolutely and the reason you stopped showing them your grades is because you actually accepted it right you didn't reject what they say if you truly rejected what they said you had kept on showing them report cards if they want to be unhappy they can be unhappy that's on them right does that make sense yeah that does the second you stopped showing them the report card is the second they didn't you didn't need them to tell you anymore you just internalized it like what do you think about that i mean like my grades are still the same like throughout these years so i'd say i'm doing all right pretty well but i don't ever like my grades are like one of the strong points where i feel like yeah i'm doing good i'm doing well i don't really have anything to worry about do you show them to your parents no why not because i know what they're gonna have to say about it and how does what they say about it make you feel before it would probably make me feel bad but now it's like i just don't care enough or like i don't hold their opinion about my grades and that back over the guard so i think you've learned we don't really know right but i i would hypothesize like put something to you which is that like you still do care you've just learned how to be calloused like it's gonna hurt right because you want to be proud of your grades and if you're really proud of your grades it's like you know like other people can be upset with it but when we're confident in ourselves other people can say whatever they want to and it won't affect us right so but what i'm hearing from you is like you're not showing your parents because they're still going to be disappointed in you because that's like it's not perfect which means they're not going to be happy and you don't want to deal with that yeah it's just too much of an edit to like get into an argument about something yeah right so when we say too much of a headache like we're going to interpret a little bit there there's you're going to feel hurt because they're not proud of you and since they're not proud of you you know you don't know how to be proud of yourself et cetera et cetera we've already kind of covered that you with me yeah i'm with you so a couple things like what do you think i mean how do we how do you move forward from this david i guess it's a hard question yeah growing thought caring kind of about what they might have to say yeah so i think eventually i hope that you get to a place where you're okay with them not being happy with you because that's on them like let me ask you a question you don't have to answer this but i kind of i'm just trying to think about whether i should ask this question okay you don't have to answer this but it's tease up because i'm going to give you a hypothetical do you want kids one day i've always been in the camp of no but uh i have a sister and she's pregnant and i was like maybe my future will change but i still think i'm like 70 30. okay no so let me ask you a question if your sister if you could transplant consciousness with your sister and you had a kid one day and your kid after one semester of college came to you and showed you a 4.27 on a report card what would you say to your kid i tell them good job that's i don't know probably not what my parents said to me but i don't know how to like kind of compliment people and tell them i'm proud of them that's weird because i've never been chill and would you tell your kid good job would you be proud of them would you think they need to do better no i think they'd be doing well would you be happy with that what they've accomplished i would be yeah but i think this is like another can of worms maybe like i feel like braids don't matter that much great right so there's another can of worms and maybe you'd go out and celebrate that's what you do when your kid comes home with a 4.27 out of 4.33 gpa right and so then like why would you do that for let's say your niece or your child but like you can't do that for yourself it's i guess the answer is just it's harder to be proud of yourself for something else right yep that's a part of it but i think that too is because your parents didn't show you not only did they show you not how to not celebrate they didn't show you how to be proud of yourself so this is something you're gonna have to work on but like i would just play with these thoughts for a little while david so cup questions otherwise i'm going to summarize i need to think about that for a second uh i guess when i'm like talking about like when people say how to be proud of yourself like what is that feeling like like because i don't know what that means yeah absolutely i think it's really confusing for you and that's okay you'll learn just like you've done a good job in basically all the other dimensions of your life right which i know sounds shocking but you're someone who's 20 years old about to graduate from college exercises has a good gpa studied abroad for six months like sounds pretty sweet you'll you'll realize this later david but like kind of like i'm saying like so for each of those things like imagine you had a daughter or a kid or son or whatever right and then like they were like dad i want to go study abroad for six months what would you say yeah do it i did it and it was great i loved it right and yet somehow your [ __ ] mind moves that into the l column yeah i guess i did even though your experience is positive so like you look like you're about to say something or ask something oh no i was just thinking about like when i first wanted to go on exchange i told my parents about it they were like no you can't what are you are you stupid like why would you want to do that so as you defied expectations what was your experience of life it was better i got to like experience something i never would have okay so let's try to piece things together number one life gives you expectations expectations come from out there as we fulfill expectations we don't actually become happy comparisons are expectations right taller shorter smarter stupider better gpa worst gpa doesn't actually and even as we like advance in the ranks right because objectively you're probably in the fifth percentile of people your age in terms of like objective performance what percent percent of people exercise regularly have the gpa that you have have studied abroad that number is like probably smaller than five percent does that feel like you're in the top five percent of course not and that's because here's the thing like basically what you've got to do david is like com so here's what we've learned okay so first of all expectations come from the outside there's a voice in here and anytime you feel pride in here you compare what you feel in here to what the world says you take that w moving into an l that's why you're not confident because you don't let yourself be confident you never get to record a w right yeah i don't yeah and then we also have like so i can uh sh i can tell you you by all means continue learning this lesson on your own but like as you advance so as you want to be confident in yourself you've been taught that achievement and living up to expectations will make you happy and confident and successful all those three things come together by the way right there can't be teased apart yeah right it's not like you can be successful and happy like that's insane the idea of being successful and unhappy like can you imagine graduating at the age of 21 with a 4.27 gpa being so successful and being really unhappy and lacking confidence in yourself yeah i could because it's like happening to me right shocking external success and living up to expectations and happiness are not one and the same the more that you live to satisfy the outside world this is what you end up with someone who's got to be a lot to be proud of and doesn't know how to feel pride so what does this mean for you so number one you're doing fine relax you'll get there it's not a race there's a certain amount of patience you need to have with yourself right like you don't need to be perfect at the age of 20. you don't even need to be perfect at the age of 30. you don't even need to be perfect you're not going to be pro you're never going to be perfect you could die five years from now you could die tomorrow you could live to six like for 60 more years you got plenty of time so how do we decide if we're not like trying to if it's not a race right which i acknowledge that society is going to tell you it's a race like how do you make decisions and i think you've made a couple good ones like you decided to study abroad has it set you back in some ways actually yes because you studied abroad instead of having work experience so just fix that right work on it supplement it but like this this ultimately comes down to listening to yourself instead of listening to external people because when you actually listen to yourself even though you made a mistake my god david you made a mistake you wasted a semester studying in europe instead of doing an internship at dunder mifflin paper company because you have a degree in industrial printing right you made a mistake and the thing that you're happiest about is the mistake you made david what does that mean for you dude maybe it's not a mistake shocking so very concretely number one your development you're appropriate right like this is what 20 like this is what kids who are graduating college feel like they're like we haven't figured this crap out yet there's a frontier i don't know if i'm going to be able to make it i've done pretty well so far but who knows if any of that translates there's a bunch of reasonable doubt it's just normal like you're about to graduate college because that's what happens in college before you go to college you're like oh my god it's college what's going to happen am i going to fail out am i going to make friends oh my god what's gonna happen then you do freshman year you do sophomore year you learn how to do it you're feeling okay feeling kind of confident maybe even having a little bit of fun and then college ends and then you're like oh my god it's the workplace what's gonna happen oh my god am i going to find a job am i going to get a job is everything going to fall apart and then you're going to be okay maybe a little bit of a bumpy ride you're going to do okay and then like you're going to start relationships and it's like oh my god like i've never dated before like i don't know what to do like is it going to be okay that's life it's a series of getting good at something and then becoming a noob again it's like climbing mmr it's like i'm crushing these noobs at this mmr and then like i'm moving up a rank and it's like suddenly i'm a newbie like it's like it's life so completely normal don't worry about it i mean you are going to worry about it but i just want to share that with you even if you can't digest it yet right yeah second thing is be super careful concretely about the w's and when you move them to the l's like i want you to catch it in your mind when it happens and ask yourself like why am i moving this to the l column how do i actually feel about this like even if you feel it's okay for other people but it's not okay for me you should still acknowledge that feeling and be like wow i'm setting a really hard standard for myself so notice when you transfer the w's to l so there's actually uh research that shows that people who have imposter syndrome do this they attribute the successes of others to effort and hard work but they attribute their own successes to luck or circumstances they never take credit for their successes so you've just got to start noticing it okay my mom would be happy with this but like if i had a kid how would i feel how how would i respond to them and then even if you can't do it yet noticing you'll it'll start to happen well i actually have like a little anecdote that might that's like related to it so when i first went to europe the first month there i struggled really badly like i don't know anyone there i kind of speak the language i don't like it wasn't an english-speaking country and i just self-taught for a few months before i went so i couldn't really communicate um my stomach is weird i couldn't eat the food there i was it would just give me like food poisoning every time even though it was like a normal country right like there's nothing wrong with it it was just me but over like time over like second month third fourth month like i started to feel like fine like yeah this is just like now but someone told me it's like you've come so far from your first month you do realize that right i was like i sat down and i thought about it i was like yeah i have but that doesn't make me feel anything yes look at that turned out your first first month sucked and you were okay turns out that you got a 4.00 your first semester instead of all 4.33 and it turns out you're okay right so just notice these things be patient with yourself even in this so i'd also be very careful about one conversation to catch me up to fix me and turn me into what i'm supposed to be the worst thing i could do for you david is have you leave from this conversation imagining that you're living up to the standard that you're supposed to be what you need to do is abandon the standard entirely and like listen to yourself instead of what they're telling you don't ignore the outside world right so you should like if you want to get an internship in the last six months like hustle you know talk to your school about job placements and things like that talk to your professors like you should do all that work but like doing the work and feeling confident about it is actually completely independent which you've proven to us today right yeah questions it's just not to like like when you talk about hustling and making connections and doing all that it's like i also feel behind in that aspect like sure it's been covered for a couple years i don't really know my professors their professors i like students that i know who are really close with professors because they've been like in lab with them they've done ta they've ta for them stuff like that it's like i don't even think that they would know my name okay right so what are you gonna do about that i would say change it but i feel like i just don't have enough time okay so you don't have to do that right so i think there are some advantages but this is where you start to feel behind in time so i like ignore all the time stuff you have classes now uh no i have them in like a couple days yeah i mean are you in school right now yeah i am but school hasn't like started yet they start next week so that means that you're going to have a new professor that you've never had before uh it's the same professors generally like it's a pretty small department where like multiple professors teach multiple classes so i just go and introduce yourself how does that feel to you sounds weird yes it does sound weird and this is where like oh my god i haven't done it for three years how can i do it now and it's like that's you i mean your your path forward is the same whether you're ahead or you're behind like that's all false like we've determined that already it's just do what you need to do say hey i've been in your classes for a couple years my name is whatever and then here's the other thing that you've got to be super careful about david you're sometimes shooting yourself in the foot because there are things their assumptions that you're making which you're never giving people the chance to correct so i know that your mom said why is this a 4.0 but like who knows if you had continued showing them your report cards maybe one of them would have said at some point hey this is a good job i'm proud of you we should go celebrate but you only showed up one report card so you're never giving them the opportunity maybe you'll go introduce yourself to your professor and you'll say hi hey my name is dave and he's like yeah i know who you are it's been a pleasure having you in the class and you're gonna be like yeah i would not expect that at all i mean you've got a good gpa in a small department i'm pretty sure they know who you are maybe maybe who knows who knows right but so either way they're like whether they know who you are or don't know who you are like you should still just go and do it and you're gonna feel bad you're gonna feel behind but that's not reality that's all expectations and conditioning yeah that's true i'd focus on the w's and l's and just keep doing what you're doing because it sounds like you're taking care of business like one step at a time which is exactly what you should be doing right okay it just feels like i could be doing so much more yeah and you're going to continue to have that feeling and as you do more does the feeling go away probably won't it will like elevate your doing what i could be doing next i've achieved this but it doesn't make me feel anything now exactly good so notice that it takes practice david it takes practice but you'll get it it definitely does yeah yeah because i don't think i've ever really like aside from my grades which i guess i also discounted with like that kind of worms i felt like yeah my gpa is high but rates don't matter why like i don't really have a reason to be proud of my grades yeah so there's you moving a w to an l again right yeah so like you're not going to be confident or proud of yourself as long as you keep doing that so that's why it kind of goes back to that notice every time you do that notice how you try to live up to expectations and remember that when you actually listen to yourself instead of listening to the expectations oh i shouldn't introduce myself now because it's too late now other people know them better that's all the voices from the outside that's not going to lead you down it may make you successful because you'll flagellate yourself to become a very high performer but it won't make you happy yeah definitely but even if i recognize that how does that lead to like confidence of happiness i have to manifest that from within but i don't know like it does feel that right i i mean so i i i know it's very confusing but that's the first step and it's the same way it's like in the same way that your study abroad experience is something that you're proud of like it's confusing if you had never studied abroad and you had a conversation with yourself you would not be able to convince yourself to study abroad right yeah so that's where like this is the point david where like i can't answer the next step for you if you ask how does it happen this is where i'd say have awareness and do it and then you tell us right again but you said it in like one of your previous videos i watched like your youtube videos and stuff but just like people tell you that if you do xxx xyz or whatever it'll happen but no one tells you when it's gonna happen so patience yeah okay good luck to you david thank you so much take care everybody thanks so much adios doctor yep thank you bye okay so let's recap quickly before we move on so a really common really really common situation sometimes we grow up with expectations and we try to live up to expectations and in our attempts to live up to expectations we actually do a decent job but does it feel like a decent job every time we do something our mind tells us you could do more you could do better it's not good enough other people are doing more and the more we listen to that voice why do we listen to that voice it's because we want to be confident we want to be happy we want to be successful and if our mind tells us like oh like do more do more do more and why do we listen to it to make it shut up right so we want to do something where our mind is like good job instead of do more so like okay i got to do more do more and eventually the mind will be quiet what are we actually reinforcing in that situation we're actually reinforcing the behavior of inadequacy we're reinforcing this idea that when i accomplish something my mind tells me to do more we're like literally activating those neurons of inadequacy over and over and over and over again and so what do you find in these people what you find is anytime there's a success they take that w and move it to the l and we heard today where that like literally where that comes from and so we have a 20 year old who's got an excellent gpa has studied abroad exercises has become more social who's like oh my god i'm such a noob if that guy's a noob what does that make me right so be careful about what your mind does be careful about using achievement as a shortcut to confidence because paradoxically you can wind up in this situation where the more you achieve your mind can always find someone who's better than you right so be careful about that and notice when your mind when you do something that's a win and you move it to the l as long as you keep doing that you're not going to be confident in yourself because you don't let yourself celebrate the wins you turn them into losses there's all kinds of crap that can come up too like but if i start being content with my wins does that mean that i'm apathetic and i'm not going to achieve anymore like it's all kinds of crap that p your mind will argue it's a conversation for another day we'll get a caller on that eventually but just focus on that and be careful about trying to live a life where you live up to expectations instead of listening what to what's in here because it's a fast way to unhappiness for sure and paradoxically in my experience generally speaking leads to less success over time because you get burnt out you're it's not you're not it's not it's not in your heart when you show up at work like even though it's prestigious you don't actually want to be there and what's going to happen is there's someone who actually wants to be there and is just as capable as you are and then they're going to outperform you and then that's going to make you feel worse you're going to push yourself even farther to catch up to that person but the more that you push yourself doing something that you don't enjoy you'll just never catch someone who enjoys what they do so listen to this and then move in a different direction where there's going to be a bunch of other people who have forced themselves into that situation but now you're the one who's passionate about being there and so then you'll rise to the top kind of bizarre think through a lot of your assumptions about stuff like is life a race like what's at the end right so i'll leave y'all with one last thing before we move on to the next caller when i was i realized this later so i kind of like screwed around in my 20s instead of becoming a doctor so i started med school around 27 28 finish med school at 32. and so people are like you know i was thinking about that i was like oh my god i'm so behind i'm so behind so i'm so behind i finished med school at the age of 32. i had a friend from high school and finished med school at the age of 24. i'm eight years older than she was oh my god then she started residency and worked a hundred hours a week before between the ages of 24 and 28. was between 24 or 28 like i went to india spent some time at ashrams did a lot of gaming i had a blast and so this is the thing that i that really confuses me about people are trying to get ahead are you trying to get ahead so that you can retire at the age of 60 instead of 65 so you can really enjoy those last 10 years of your life and sacrificing your 20s like you're trading a year of in your 20s for a year in your 60s is that a good trade just think about it for a second don't automatically accept whatever the expectations the world is feeding you 20 20's are again great time to to waste time honestly way better i imagine than wasting your time in your 70s so random 955 is asking what if the expectation is not from external but myself so this is the question you got to ask yourself very good question random 955 where did that internal expectation come from because chances are it's not an expectation that was born of your introspection and exploration it's a it's an expectation that you internalized chances are right because that's where most of our expectations come from you
