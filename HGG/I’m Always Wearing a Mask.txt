they are able actually to form social connections romantic relationships be successful at work so don't give up hope it just takes a little bit of work hey friend hi there uh what do you go by uh so my name is robert roger uh robert robert robert yeah robert okay welcome robert how are you yeah not bad thank you how are your friendships going so my friendships have been i'm talking the past tense i don't really have any friendships at the moment but my friendships have always felt codependent okay so i i don't know how do you i can i've got like maybe five minutes worth of stuff that i will sort of read out is that okay yeah i'd love that thank you so much for preparing okay um so i'm gonna start off by saying that i was diagnosed as autistic i think when i was three okay and so when i was in school so secondary school 11 to 16 i wasn't able to mask my symptoms as well so people would make fun of me for being weird like i was instantly weird to people and so naturally because of this i sort of fell into like the nerd group of my school so i remember yeah and so i remember early on i had this quite an awkward encounter i think it was with a girl um i just said something dumb and my friend like asked me you know why why am i so awkward from people and i told him about my diagnosis and so i remember regretting that day quite a lot because as soon as i told him i gave him this like you know i gave him this buzzword basically and so from then on like all throughout school i was that word was used to describe me like constantly um and so in in my group there were i would say three people who are a lot smarter than i was uh and i was one of the four that one very intelligent i was educationally quite mediocre so i could never really join in on any intelligent discussion whatsoever however the only reason i had any value in this group was because i could make people laugh like that was like my place that i held in the group um and i found like i mean sometimes i i could say things that were humorous but there were times where i would say something or i would just do something i would say something outrageous or do something outrageous and you know people would laugh at me rather than with me common yeah so um in fact i think it happened more than people were laughing at me than with me no i think of it yeah so i realized that the only way i could get a positive response out of my friends was to just make them like i i didn't have any place in this group other than my ability to make them laugh and i would sort of uh like i knew that they knew i was autistic so i would like uh i would play play it up a little bit like there were times where i would be i would pretend to be completely oblivious to certain things and in turn that would sort of gain a reaction out of them like oh look at him he's the funniest bad kid like you know he does it he doesn't know you know yep and i sort of created like a almost a character of myself rather than yeah like displaying who i was and overall i'd say i had one other group of friends who i would say more malicious if in fact it was mostly only one person um the other group i'm on good terms now with like we're okay but um there was another group of people that i joined through someone that i had known from when i was young it's like you know we were we grew up together i lived on the same lived on the same street and you know his he knew about my diagnosis because his mother had told him just for the sake of awareness and you know when we were kids it's like you know it's just childhood friends it doesn't matter but i i remember we reconnected later on um like sort of in our secondary school years started playing cs go together and he played cs go with his school friends and so he introduced me to them and the first time he introduced me to his friendship group he introduced me as oh this is the autistic guy that i was telling you i was telling you about and uh he you know he didn't even introduce me by name i had to say it myself but he you know he introduced me as this label right off the bat um but i you know i i still managed to do my usual thing i was able to fit in with this group i was you know i came in with my brand of loud and obnoxious humor and managed to get laughs out of them so i like i knew that i was able to fit in at the very least um and i remember the first time that i met his friends in person they were kind of like i don't know what it was but they were hesitant around me and i wondered why like i was you know i just like introduced myself but they they sort of like they were kind of like weirded out by me like right off the bat and later on his friend had told me that um this guy had said oh you know you need to watch out around him he's severely autistic and he might throw his arm out and accidentally hit you um and he like it was sort of set as a joke like he was trying to build this character of me basically um rather than letting his friends meet me normally and so i was always introduced as the autistic guy i was never robert um i was always his autistic friend that's how people refer to me as and you know i i was able to still like fit into a degree but i was never really respected as a person i was just kind of this like sideshow freak on the you know sure that yeah that's how i felt um and eventually it got to the point where i understood that i was sort of a lightning rod for all of the jokes damn what a what a phrase dude that's such a powerful phrase i i heard the phrase stop being autistic a lot like if i ever said something that was like against what they were saying that was what was thrown at me just by default um if i ever tried to stand up for myself i wouldn't ever be taken seriously because i was just the funny guy that's all i was and because this word was being used to describe me so much it became synonymous with my very existence like i once i left school um and i entered college i really started like colleges uh high school 16 to 18. uh and i really struggled to adjust like i couldn't make any friends whatsoever um like i felt really really awkward around people because i thought that i just like emanated autism like they could just detect it just by standing near me and you know that doesn't really make sense right but because i i've been caught like i'd become so attached to this word and i i felt like i never understood really what i was being made fun of for but i was being made fun of for something so i thought you know i don't people can just see it but i can't does that make sense yeah absolutely okay um and so yeah i didn't make any friends in my last years of education and you know ever since i've just been like i've been three years out of education just working various different jobs um and i've sort of realized how it's affected me like in my working life because and just like my ability to make friends in general like that i've been around some people in work who are like my age and i could have made friends with but i didn't want to dis i didn't want to like do the same thing as i did with all of my other friends and like try to be outgoing and so i would you know i was i was always worried that they could like anyone that talks to me can detect it like they can they know like they can pick up on like my awkwardness um so i i basically tried to pretend to be as normal as possible uh and and in turn i just it would it would make me seem really boring really unemotional like i wouldn't show any personality basically because i was worried that if i do show any amount of personality then it will be made fun of yeah absolutely man my heart goes out to you uh i've only got a little bit left to read um but yeah i feel like every single like i want to expand socially i want to actually learn what a good friendship feels like but i feel like this is going to get in the way because whenever i talk to people i have this like feeling of just i feel like i can't be myself at all like i have to put on you know this completely normal appearance i can't you know and i end up being yeah i've already gone over this sorry i'm yeah i'm worried that because i have this anxiety of my autism being found out and people finding out that there's something wrong with me i try to be as normal as possible and in turn that makes me seem weird in itself yeah and i just don't know artificial yeah rigid exactly yeah robert you'd mention something about codependence so now i think of it yeah so i used that word because i was the friendship group that i was talking about that i joined through my childhood friend they were like seen as sort of like popular kids basically and for me being in this friendship group um i felt like i was finally not a nerd anymore basically and so if i left this group i'd have nothing i'd i'd have to be a nerd again yeah um so and it yeah it always felt like they were above me i was i was below them and always i was always playing up to them just to stay in got it um can i just think for a second sure thank you very much for sharing things so concisely i think it's it's actually very helpful and was also quite um rich in terms of your experience and your background and your information so i'd love to just process for a moment and and kind of formulate my thoughts okay yeah so robert is it okay if i if i try to respond in a more uh almost like you kind of gave me five minutes is it okay if i kind of try to do the same back to you and then we can maybe dig in a little bit more yeah that's fine so i you know first of all my heart really goes out to you i i think you've been the unhappy recipient of so much of the struggle that we see with people who are on the spectrum so the first thing is that there's just a lack of awareness about what autism is and and so you know like even for example like your friend's mom that told him that you were on the autism spectrum that's not necessarily a bad thing like i think having awareness of people's neurodevelopment i mean neurodivergent um you know differences can actually be like a really important piece of information in helping us form appropriate relationships does that make sense yeah so it's not like we want to hide it like we want people to be kind of aware but i think the downside is that when we start to tell people sometimes what happens is the autism starts to be our defining characteristic yeah and once it starts to become the defining characteristic i've seen this in a way that i recently that i really hadn't seen even five years ago where sometimes groups of people right because we're being like more accepting of people with autism and it's neurodevelopmental and it's like you know it's a little neurodivergent and so like i've almost seen people who will have like a token autistic friend so like groups of people will have like a friend and it's like oh we're cool and we're accepting because we've got one i'm friends with someone with autism so that means that i'm a cool person and i'm like accepting of people and i'm woke and all this kind of stuff but even then in that moment they they don't have a friend with autism they have an autistic friend and this is where sometimes like you know i mean i think you shared that beautifully when you kind of said like you got introduced as oh here's the autist i found you know and they didn't they didn't even like introduce your name and that's where like what's sort of starting to happen is people are starting starting to be defined by their autism instead of autism being a part of who they are and this can get like even worse because as you sort of get defined by this one thing you're left with a very interesting social challenge which is like this is like these people are my friend because like oh like i'm autistic and then what happens is like you're trying to figure out okay how do i relate to these people because they're judging me in this way and what a lot of people with autism will end up doing we'll also see this with other uh neurodivergent kind of conditions like adhd is very very common where you become the clown right because that's how you get your social status you may not be as intelligent as them i'm not entirely sure i agree with that by the way but you know if you say that we'll accept that for now but you kind of like you turn into kind of this one trick pony where like oh like let's all laugh at the autistic kid because at least they're kind of laughing right they invite you like you're invited but you're kind of the butt of jokes and then you're kind of stuck because you're in the situation where even if you try to say something or do something or exhibit frustration with your quote-unquote friends they attribute oh they're like that's just his autism acting out like oh we don't have to take his like concerns seriously we don't have to take his his feelings seriously we don't have to take his criticisms seriously that's just the autism it's just the autism yeah and so it's a very toxic dynamic where you have to like continue paying this price of being the butt of jokes in order to get some degree of social acceptance and then as you lobby to actually be a part of the group instead of fitting in like they don't want that right because they treat you your entire relationship with them is defined by the autism and so like we feel kind of stuck by this bullying it's essentially bullying and so then what happens i've seen this a lot where people will like learn from that right and they're like okay well here's the way i've learned how to make friends which is that like people are aware of my autism it's sort of like demeaning in some ways but it also is like sort of an excuse and if i kind of screw up or people get mad at me like they're still gonna invite me next time because i'm autistic you know so it does have some advantages i can poke fun at myself that's what i bring to people that's my fundamental value and i'm gonna so i'm gonna engage in self-deprecating humor which is gonna encourage disrespect and we're going to like keep that going because that's how i connect with people and over time what happens is people realize like oh this is actually kind of toxic i don't like this and then you become ashamed of the autism because people have been treating you so poorly because you're autistic and then you try to suppress parts of yourself whereas like i don't think that you're funny just because you're autistic it sounds to me like one of your best qualities is that you're actually like really genuinely funny and and so then what happens is we try to hide our autism and we suppress those humorous parts of ourself you end up coming across as kind of like flat yes right and then like people don't you don't it's like the thing that you are the most valuable thing that you can offer to another human being is something that you've taken off the table because at the beginning you used humor as a compensation for other potential deficiencies or autism or whatever and then you realize like in your mind those two things have come together like you can't be funny without being autistic almost and then as you take a humor off the table because you're taking autism off the table then like how do you connect with people and then you kind of become rigid you kind of become flat you kind of become inauthentic and then it's hard to connect with people when you're just kind of like neutral yeah it's like i gotta say it it's really hard to be in this situation and this is a situation that i hear about so much from people who are on the spectrum um does that resonate with you that it's you know yeah a hundred percent i mean every single thing definitely yeah so so and this is what stuff i i i don't know that i have an easy answer for you because i i think it's like it's a problem we're seeing that's like more and more you know challenging it's happening more and more so let me start with a couple of questions is that okay yeah that's fine so the first is how do you feel about being autistic uh i'm just gonna think for a second i feel like it's an unnecessary hindrance for my communication it's that i don't like there's a lot of uh there's this stereotype of an autistic person where they're sort of like gifted in some sort of way like oh you know rain man if you've ever watched that movie or you can count cards whatever i'm not i'm not like good at maths i'm not good at coding i'm not really particularly good at anything i just have the social downsides that's how i personally feel about it yeah so i think that's a really good um that's a really good description because sometimes in the game of life we almost think about it like i don't know if you play d d or like rpgs but not really okay so like sometimes we have like this character creation kind of perspective where it's like if i get a negative trait i get some kind of bonus point somewhere else and then it all evens out in the end like i can min max by having a really low stat over here but then i'm super high over here and unfortunately sometimes that's not how life works right sometimes things are just like negative like there's no there's no like upside to trauma like right there you know that it so so that's challenging so how do you feel about so you you kind of don't feel like you have any kind of advantages you're not an autistic savant and so but how do you feel about like what is how do you feel about that like not having an advantage and just having a straight disadvantage i can't really it's bad i can't really elaborate on it anymore like you know there's there's no upside to it yeah so do you find yourself wishing that you weren't autistic all the time and are you ashamed of being autistic um i will i will say not so much anymore like i've been working a lot on dealing with that shame and i'm not really ashamed of it anymore i i the way i see it now is i could do without it and it probably would have made my life play out a little it would have made my life easier at that stage of my life but i'm not ashamed of it necessarily like i've sort of worked on that so i'm really happy to hear that i think that's going to be very important for going forward and um so what makes it hard for you to form connections with people now um i would say this is slowly improving but i would say for the past three years the only people have already interacted with people at work it's the the difficulties of like there's something so awkward about small talk and just regular passing interactions with people and that there's a lot of that that happens at work you need to say good morning like how are you i'm fine how are you you need to ask them the same question and then they say the same thing back to you um and it like the the in authenticity of all of these interactions i always feel like disgusting after i engage in any of like i can't do small talk that's just like one of them uh what do you the question was what do you think stops me from building connections with people right yeah and if it's like i don't like small talk that's a completely valid answer yeah okay and the other one a big part is like eye contact um i can only really make eye contact for like two seconds at a time before i have to look away because obviously like you know you look like you know people normal people look at each other and so over time i've learned that i have to kind of do that even though it is difficult so i'll look at people in the eyes for like two seconds and then i have to look away because it comes it becomes too uncomfortable and what this means is that people sort of naturally get an impression of me that i'm not really on the same page as they are like i'm you know i'm not listening to them or i'm not interested in what they're saying so i i think i actually give across like an arrogant vibe like if people don't know they just assume that i'm rude and and do you do how do you feel about telling people that you're on the spectrum i i don't i wouldn't ever do it unless it was the only person i've only told i'm not going to count all the people that i've told uh it would make me uncomfortable to tell someone unless it was necessary like a manager for instance uh i do like i told my manager at my current job uh that i'm autistic and i if i'm not making eye contact as much it it feels good to sort of get that weight off my shoulders that i don't feel like i have to pretend like they understand that i've got this thing that might make me seem slightly blunt or standoffish at times and i've sort of got a reason for it so i think the the fear of telling someone can be quite strong because i worry about maybe like oh will they think that i'm incompetent will they fire me but i think once i you know the most recent case telling my manager once i told him um i feel like people at work started to like when i when i used to come to work i would just like come in not say a word and i would go home but now that people sort of understand they're okay with that and i'm actually i actually feel more like a lot more comfortable in my workplace and so i feel like i i have actually started talking more to my co-workers now so it i know the positive effects that telling people can have it's just getting over that initial hurdle of telling them that that scares me yeah so um robert i actually feel like i've got some i want to share some more stuff with you i is it i feel like you actually did such a beautiful job with your initial kind of five minutes that i i don't feel like i need to ask you a bunch of questions is it okay if i share some thoughts with you or did were you hoping that i would ask you more questions no you can share your thoughts it's fine so so here's so i'm optimistic for you first of all so i think just talking to you now i think you have a lot to offer people um and you know i don't know if hopefully you're not watching twitch chat or anything like that but oh no definitely not good um and also i i think that like what what i'm you know overwhelmingly seeing is that people think you're a cool person and you know you're worthy of hanging out with and have friendship and all this kind of stuff right so so like i i'm not i'm not hearing an overt rejection from people on twitch which i think is great so yeah so i think part of what you're dealing with is the fear that you have is primarily because you are it sounds like in two primary situations also with people who are like kids for the most part right and so kids are not going to be the most empathic in fact kids are some of the nastiest people on the planet when it comes to treating other like treating people with compassion like kids can be some of the most cruel human beings on like in the world and and so i think a lot of your fear actually is reasonable right because you've had this experience where people have defined you by autism have treated you a particular way because of that autism some of that was also like played into by you because that was your adaptation to get acceptance right yeah and so going forward i i almost think that you're you know what i would what what i've actually seen works and i'm is first of all developing a healthy understanding and relationship with your own uh autism and what and i think you're actually like really far there so in in the past when i've done you know therapy with people who have autism we try to get to kind of where you are which is that i'm not ashamed of it and it sucks like i wish i didn't have it and it's it's okay to authentically wish i wasn't autistic and also like it's just part of who i am and i don't need to be ashamed of it like you're completely valid with all of those thoughts the other thing that i'd kind of say is there there is some we talked about the downsides of increasing autism awareness which is that sometimes you'll have social groups that want a token autistic friend but the upside is that there are a lot of people out there who are more aware that you know autism is more common than we originally thought it's a spectrum um and that will be actually like more understanding of your situation and and try to understand you better and will like recognize that if you're not making eye contact if you struggle with small talk they won't attribute that to other things kind of unfairly right like you're kind of like you're uninterested or you know you're arrogant or whatever like you've kind of said so oddly enough in your case i would actually say just like keep trying to connect with people and also you don't want to lead necessarily with hi my name is robert i'm on the spectrum but also like i i wouldn't you know if you feel like especially with small talk i think you can kind of like share that tidbit a little bit earlier and i wouldn't be surprised i'm so happy to hear about kind of your situation at work because what i've actually found is that you know if you kind of put that out there and you kind of put yourself out there and i would include like activating your humor too that if you try that with five or six different groups of people it'll land really well with like 50 of them and i think to a certain degree it's kind of a numbers game because as people are more you know compassionate towards people who are neurodivergent that actually like opens a lot of doors and also that like if you if they kind of understand that oh the reason that you're not making eye contact isn't because you dislike me it's maybe a manifestation of being on the autism spectrum like that will allow relationships to foster and hopefully you'll actually find situations more like you did at work i'm actually really hopeful because you've at least had a couple right and so oddly enough i think forming relationships with you is really sort of like acknowledging that fear acknowledging where that fear comes from and also not letting the fear control you and kind of taking a chance being a little bit funny and you know also like not hiding the fact i wouldn't advertise it but also not being ashamed of and not hiding the fact that you're on the spectrum how does that sound to you yeah i think you know i don't want to be someone who makes it i don't want to sort of like wear autism as a badge and sort of like show it around and but at the same time i think yeah when when necessary when it makes sense to tell people that i will and i think i'm a lot more comfortable with doing that now yeah i i'm actually just talking to you and having this interaction makes me like quite optimistic that you know it's going to be a little bit of a bumpy road and i think you're probably looking at some amount of rejection but also that rejection is not something that i think is like this is the hard thing is sometimes it's hard to acknowledge that if a group rejects us it's not like we're personally deficient right yeah and even then it may not be like a straight rejection it's just like you know if you have hey like you want to hang out sometime yeah sure i'd love to and then nothing ever happens doesn't mean that i don't like you it just means that maybe i'm busy or maybe i'm struggling with my own depression or you know like there's a lot of family drama going on or things like that and i think that's where it's like it's just important to remember that to a certain degree it's like kind of a numbers game that if you reach out and and try to connect with five different groups of people you know two to three of them will probably like not land but all you really need is like one or two and then i think you're you've really come a long way and i'm optimistic that if you just keep on trying you'll actually do really well yeah how does that sound i i mean the the rejection part like obviously i'm i have quite a negative relationship well i think everyone does no one nobody wants to be rejected um but yeah getting getting over that sort of oh everyone hates me if these people hate me that will that will be the most difficult part um but yeah yeah i mean so i like i said it's going to be a bumpy road i think this is the kind of thing we're actually like seeing a therapist could also help you with that kind of stuff insurance i am currently seeing a therapist oh that's fantastic so i i would i would take that you know those rejections i would take them to therapy and kind of vent them there um i'm not surprised at all to hear that you're seeing a therapist because it sounds like you've really come a long way and and you're you know doing really well the one thing that i would remember is that sometimes this can be a feature of uh being on the spectrum but it is not exclusive to being on the spectrum so a lot of neurotypical people will do this like you know that rejection is sometimes a manifestation of black and white thinking yeah and and just be aware of that right so black and white thinking is not specific to autism spectrum but i tend to see it happen more in in people with autism um and so some of the stuff like oh the only thing i bring to the table is self-deprecating humor that kind of black and white thinking i would start to really become aware of and question a little bit because i think you bring a lot i'm just talking to you now like i feel like i would have no trouble hanging out with you for like two or three hours and just you know and you haven't cracked any jokes like you're insightful you're thoughtful you know you're organized with your speech you're self-aware like you bring a lot to the table yeah but like in you know with the way that i'm interacting with you currently it's very um it's very formal like i'm not interacting with you in a like a bubbly energetic way i i you know i'm just i'm just saying words that's all i'm doing and i want to get past that like exterior that i've built for myself and you know you mean it robert you mean it's get it gets better than this i mean i don't know i i feel like this is just very i feel like you're you make you feel like you're i feel like you might feel like you're talking to a robot right now because of the sort of i i don't feel like i'm talking to a robot well that's how i always feel when i talk to people because i i feel like because i i don't i'm not emotive and i'm not energetic like other people are they they get the impression that i'm like and yeah i don't know so i'll just take what you said like yeah so so like like it's important to acknowledge that right like but yeah that that's the whole point is that a lot of you forming friendships is going to be not negotiating against yourself could you elaborate yeah so like like you know you you're you're pre-rejecting yourself you're not even giving me the chance to accept or reject you you're assuming that i think i'm talking to a robot yeah i i i didn't feel that way at all yeah i was the only one who said it so yeah like you don't seem like a robot to me it's great to hear that's why honestly my reaction when you told me like i'm not being bubbly and energetic is like this is great you're telling me it gets better than this like that sounds awesome you know and that that's what i think i'm hearing from you robert is that you're not showcasing your best self i think the big difference is that even your best self is actually completely acceptable i mean even not being your best self is completely acceptable and sounds fantastic i just feel like i'm talking to a normal open thoughtful person that's what i get from this conversation okay i don't think i've ever been told that before i think but it's good to hear that outside perspective i don't i'm not getting any sense that you're funny but i i would i would say the the word that comes to mind the most is that you're thoughtful yeah and if it gets better than that it's like like give me the dlc bro you know like don't don't don't pay wall the humor i appreciate that thank you any questions um i i would like to think sure just for a second so okay i think a big one for me is is eye contact and like how much of it is is it something that can be worked on like can i learn to make more eye contact uh this is where the answer is gonna be kind of strange the answer is gonna be yes and no so if you look at you know i'm not an expert on autism in terms of my clinical practice but i think that they're so if you look at like evidence-based psychotherapies and what's effective for people who are on the spectrum there is a certain amount of like social skills training that can improve your ability to like relate to other people yeah and you can sort of socially train it but it may never be at the level of like natural eye contact if your brain was a little bit different okay so i hopefully i mean i love it if someone proved me wrong but you know what we understand about people who are neurodivergent is that their brains are a little bit different you can compensate for a lot of it what i will tell you is that at some point it becomes completely irrelevant so like you may have difficulty with eye contact or it may feel a little bit artificial it's kind of hard this has been my experience working with people on the spectrum is that it's hard to like find a natural level right so you learn how to make more eye contact but then you can feel like you're staring a little bit too much and that can make people so some people uncomfortable and the truth of the matter is that for some people that i've worked with they never get to the neurotypical level and it's actually kind of irrelevant because it feels awkward for the first hour that you're with people but i i've worked with a ton of people who never master eye contact who are still able to live completely fulfilling social and romantic lives because at some point like a lot of that eye contact is actually with the initial social interaction and i don't know how to say this but you know i'm assuming that you've got relationships with your family but like do you have eye contact problems with your family um it's not as bad it's not as bad but that that like i can't look there's still that thing where i can't look for too long yeah it just gets uncomfortable right so like you may continue to have it my point is that it may not impact the relationship yeah does that make sense yeah i mean i have been told that eye contact is huge when it comes to connecting with people yeah but i think it's it's more important early on right and and what i've seen is that people like conform relationships and then then it's totally fine like if you go to movies like if you go to the movies with a couple of friends you're not no one's making eye contact anyway so it's not really an issue and if you go to a meal you know it's not like everyone's staring at each other for extended periods of time and so it's okay like if you go on a hike with someone for example like you're going to be walking side by side you're not even going to be looking at each other so as you develop relationships with people i think eye contact becomes less of a hindrance in terms of the relationship okay but i i i'm you know but i i have worked with people who continue to struggle with it and and never really master it fully which is unfortunate but also doesn't determine your future yeah and uh am i good to ask one more question sure so i have worked in places in the past where i feel like due to you know not being so you know very due to being autistic and well people aren't ever really aware that i'm autistic they just think that i'm off or rude as i've said before and i'm worried as to how uh what am i trying to say like how much important like is it common for autistic people to be fired from their job because of uh things that they give off to people hmm that's such a good question um i actually don't so i imagine that there's probably research about that but i don't know the statistics um i i i don't know is the short answer okay uh uh what let me think about how i can try to offer something a little bit more substantive so i would find it hard to believe that i would imagine that being on the spectrum makes social interactions at work a little bit more challenging and i would also expect that challenging social interactions at work don't correlate well with employment and things like that yeah but and i'm not using an end here i'm really using a butt there are lots of other people and lots of other conditions that lead to problematic social interactions that have nothing to do with autism right like so people can be narcissistic they can be passive-aggressive and the other thing that i'd say is that i know a ton of people who are very successfully employed who are are on the spectrum okay and you know like so so i i think it's it may be a disadvantage of some kind but i i think it's far from destiny and i think it's all so far from like insurmountable yeah it's just a case of finding the right company yeah something like more of an issue somewhere yeah so like also vocalizing to people when you're ready that you are on the spectrum and that it affects things in a particular way but like you know you know sharing with your boss that hey i'm on the spectrum these are the things that i struggle with but like you know anytime i'm open to feedback i'm a very hard worker and here are the ways that i try to compensate um you know if this ever becomes a problem please let me know and i'm happy to work on it like even vocalizing things like that can actually set you above your peers because a lot of neurotypical people will never say stuff like that and they'll be oblivious to feedback and take things personally and things like that yeah so you know if you feel like autism is a disadvantage i'm not going to disagree with you you're the one who lives your life and at the same time i don't think that it dooms you to anything and the person that i feel like i'm talking to who's this thoughtful and proactive about their life i'm optimistic that you can have a good job good career and you can form solid human connections okay that's great to hear thank you yeah i think you've put in a lot of work robert and i think it shows okay i mean is is there anything else so not from my end all right brilliant thank you very much thank you great thanks for sharing and thanks for calling in all right thank you take care oh inferno pizza wants to be his friend real bad yeah so i think you know i just want to kind of recap this for a second so sometimes we're becoming more aware that people are on the autism spectrum so a couple of things to remember the first is that the autism spectrum is a spectrum and so there's you know you can't define the destinies of people on the autism spectrum in one particular way because different people have different advantages disadvantages etc i think unfortunately what we're starting to see is that as on the one hand it's good that there's more autism awareness right so people like robert have is in a workplace where he explained this to his boss boss was very understanding um you know so it sounds like he's feeling more comfortable at work so i think it's totally fine to share with people if you are on the spectrum a weird thing that i'm starting to see though is that sometimes it starts to define you in a social group which can actually be quite toxic where everything that you do is because you're autistic right it's like we don't sometimes allow people with autism to have normal variation and and just because i'm mad at you doesn't mean that like i'm autistic and and can't regulate my emotions it's possible the reason that i'm mad at you is because you're actually treating me inappropriately and with disrespect so sometimes we'll see a lot of invalidation towards people on the spectrum and sometimes we'll also see a weird kind of toxic thing which is like the token autistic friend in a friend group which as robert said can sometimes make you a lightning rod for jokes and so the challenge is if you grow up on the spectrum and it doesn't necessarily be i have to be on the autism spectrum i've seen this with other things like adhd as well where you sort of learn that humor and self-deprecating humor is the way is the way that you get admission to a friend group but if that's what starts to happen like you know you're paying a poor admission price and you're not truly being accepted so if you're if you're struggling to form connections i think a lot of it is actually disentangling some of the dis self-deprecating humor and things like that like sort of trying to find a nice balance with accepting that you are autistic accepting that there may not be a particular advantage if you know not to say that it's all bad right so people with autism are allowed to say this is not a disadvantage they're allowed to say this is a disadvantage like that depends on the individual we don't get to decide that for people with autism you have to develop your own relationship and comfort and acceptance with your neurodivergence and once you do that hopefully you're not ashamed of it right so i think overcoming that shame is really important and then as you start to form connections with people thankfully there is more awareness and sometimes you have to let people know that you're on the spectrum to help them understand why you may not be doing some things that neurotypical people do but in my experience people who sort of take this approach and and overcome some of their fears and don't like slip into automatic self-deprecating humor because that attracts for a particular kind of person they are able actually to form social connections romantic relationships be successful at work so don't give up hope it just takes a little bit of work
