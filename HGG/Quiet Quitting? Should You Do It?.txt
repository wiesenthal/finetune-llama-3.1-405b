but now what happens is over time in order to get promoted if person a starts going above and beyond person b if they want that promotion starts going above and beyond and so now what sort of happened is that in order to get that promotion you don't just go above and beyond you have to go way above and beyond so let's take a quick look there's a really interesting washington post article so quiet quitting isn't really about quitting here are the signs burnout is at an all-time high and here's what managers should be on the lookout for so this article was really interesting and someone about a week ago or two weeks ago kind of quote uh came up with this term of quiet quitting and what this article talks about is that you know what people are starting to do is renounce hustle culture and sort of quitting the idea of going above and beyond and so what this sort of like means is that so people are sort of using this term quiet quitting and you know as is i guess this person kathy catcher says it's quiet quitting is a new term for an old concept which is employee disengagement so the article goes on to talk about burnout um you know it talks a little bit about you know how quiet quitting is shockingly doing what you're paid for and so so there's there's like a lot of concern about burnout there's a lot of concern about wow this is like great exposure for this ad um you know what does quiet quitting actually look like and so we're talking about things like uh diminished motivation low engagement being withdrawn from the team limiting communication and interaction to only what is required and then the article starts talking a little bit about you know what to do about it if you were a manager okay so that the target of this this article is sort of geared towards manager and so how should employers respond you know so like people are sort of like changing like their their work ethic their approach to their jobs and things like that so what the article sort of suggests is that to better understand how employees are feeling we should frequently survey staff and go beyond productivity scores and seek comments that help managers understand the full picture of engagement it goes on to talk about doing more onboarding and exit interviews by hr to motivate to see what motivates employees and drives them to leave and then how do you build workplaces that don't want people to leave and this is where they say managers can help burnout by encouraging employees to take breaks during the day and use their vacation and paid time off right so you're burnt out like why don't you take your vacation because that's going to fix the problem right and then they're sort of talking a little bit about a couple of other things like um you know office yoga and taking man uh mental health days it's critical critical for managers that foster a a workplace environment that is psychologically safe so that employees feel comfortable in asking for help without retribution that sounds good i think that's actually the best point which we're gonna talk about so what's the deal with this quiet quitting like what's going on here and like what what should we really do about it so i think there are a couple of things to keep in mind so let's try to understand how we got to quiet quitting the way we got to quiet quitting was through something that i would call effort inflation so here's what used to happen at your job so you start with a job and there's certain expectations requirements right this is what's required of you of your job and then what happened is people realized okay there are five employees and one of them is going to get promoted to manager so what employees started doing is going above and beyond because it's the employee that goes above and beyond who gets promoted and so there was a benefit to going above and beyond but now what happens is over time in order to get promoted if person a starts going above and beyond person b if they want that promotion starts going above and beyond person c goes above and beyond person d goes above and beyond person e goes above and beyond and so now what sort of happened is that in order to get that promotion you don't just go above and beyond you have to go way above and beyond so now going do going the extra mile is the norm and so as more and more people strive for promotion what started to happen is companies started expecting this from their employees now it's become the norm right because everyone's doing it and then the employer is like oh this is kind of interesting like everyone's going above and beyond i guess this is the workplace culture this is the culture of the workplace that people we want people who are go-getters we want people who are going to go the extra mile we want people who are going to et cetera et cetera and so it's almost like a college degree where like before a college degree used to get you particular jobs right like in order to get that job you needed a college degree then everyone started going to college and so the value of the college degree went down and now you need a master's degree in order to distinguish yourself so it's like educational inflation and we've seen this effort inflation and so now like how do we kind of approach this if we're employees if we're employers so for the record i don't think that going above and beyond at work is necessarily bad um and we'll kind of talk a little bit about that but i think there's a lot of really interesting questions that you should ask yourself so the first thing to consider is what kind of workplace you actually work at and this is for employers and employees because we've done corporate consulting before and in our career coaching program we work with people who are primarily employees but also managers and things like that and the first thing to understand is what is the value in your workplace you have to ask this question critically what is the value in your workplace of a going going above and beyond is it actually rewarded in some way how is it rewarded what is the expectation and this is where if you're an employee and you've been going above and beyond and you haven't really been rewarded for it that's something that you need to seriously like think about right what is the value to you going the extra mile because the truth is that there's a lot of value to going the extra mile in some places and if you're an employer you need to be asking yourself the same question what happens to employees how how are employees who go above and beyond treated in comparison to employees who just do the bare minimum and this is where we've got to be really really careful because depending on like you know where you work so i think like government service is kind of like a good example where like your promotion rate and your salary include increase tends to be based on seniority so going the extra mile doesn't necessarily get you a whole lot now i've worked with some people who are managers in government service who do actually really reward employees and things like that so that's their exceptions to that rule but for you to just critically think a little bit about okay what is the situation in my workplace the second thing that that really kind of bothers me about this article and this is something that we need to really think about is that this article is geared towards managers and employers and it's not really advocating to truly understand what the employee experiences and this is a huge problem so i'll give y'all just a simple example and this is something that i struggle with myself so the article says and as a manager encourage people to take vacation days so there's what there are two kinds of work there's work in which vacation is time off and there's work in which vacation is procrastinating with your work so if i take a week off a vacation do i just do that week that work of that week before vacation and after vacation because in some employment situations when you take time off it's not like you do less work it's just all that work gets delayed till you get back from vacation and the week that you get back from vacation you have to do twice as much work as you usually would and so these are the kinds of things where like instead of encouraging people to take time off a better question would be why on earth aren't people taking time off right because in some work situations that i've seen i've been in and actually content creation is one of them where it's like we you know i have to stream additionally if i'm going to take a week of vacation i actually don't i don't get time off i just reallocate time and are you in a work situation where time off is really time off or is it just piling on work to the next week and so these are the kind of fundamental things that you can encourage your employees to take time off but the question is what kind of work situation are you in like are you in a situation where time off really doesn't exist so good example of time off being time off is the medical profession so that's usually where for example if i'm a doctor and i go on vacation and someone covers my patients it's not like the work from that week is waiting for me right so if something happens during the week that i'm on vacation one of my colleagues covers for me and then i come back and it's like back to normal so another thing that they talk about is frequent surveys and exit interviews what bothers me about this is that there's sort of this attitude that okay like if you want to know how to motivate your employees like ask them right try to figure out what motivates them so that you can structure the environment to kind of maximize their motivation which sort of makes sense from an employer's standpoint the problem that i have with this kind of approach is that i don't get the sense that people are genuinely trying to understand for the employee's benefit right we're trying to understand from the manager's benefit so the way that they sort of structure this is like okay do like you know onboarding interviews and exit interviews to try to maximize motivation whereas like that seems to me like the employer isn't actually caring about the employee they're really thinking about their own goals which is like okay how do i maximize productivity of my workers and the other thing that i'd sort of say is that if you're in a manager and you're struggling with employees who are quiet quitting it's not about trying to assess their motivation so you can maximize it it's about actually asking them hey what's going on like do you feel like your extra work is rewarded and so quiet quitting is going on all over the place and i think part of the reason is because for a long time we've been advocating for hustle culture we've been advocating to work hard to get ahead the challenge though is that working hard no longer gets you ahead so like that's why people are quiet quitting like that's simple right it's that simple and if you're an employer and you're trying to figure out like okay like why aren't people like going the extra mile anymore and that's because human beings are going to do what rewards them like there's like behavioral reinforcement mechanisms in our brain and if you if people are quiet quitting on the job like there could be something going on personally with them could be but it could be because the way that you've structured the work environment doesn't actually reward people going the extra mile couple of other things to kind of think about is like you know encouraging people to take vacation is like why aren't they taking it in the first place so i i i don't think that going the extra mile is bad i don't think that all employers are evil i've worked in particular situations where i did go the extra mile and it like actually did work out really well um you know one of my mentors once said going the extra mile for a patient is going a mile too far so there are times where actually going the extra mile actually encourages other people to slack off so you've got to be careful about that kind of stuff and if you're in this situation where you're quiet quitting or burning out or things like that i think first of all that's completely okay if you're a manager where your employees are doing this kind of thing i think this is where you've got to start to ask a lot of questions does my workplace actually reward my extra work and that's where you know what we've learned in career coaching is that you may say like oh my god no they don't like i'm so like resentful because i work so hard and like they don't reward it and this is where in career coaching sometimes we'll like discover something very interesting which is that when the client comes in we'll like how does your employer know you're doing extra work well i don't know they just like they should know it's like wait a minute how should they know have you ever told them you're like no like why not well because i don't want to i don't want them to think that i'm like i'm not trying to like take too much credit i don't want to be a brag i don't want to brag about what i do and all this kinds of stuff so what we've sort of really discovered is that interacting with your employer can be like complicated in ways that we don't realize and there can be other kinds of perceptual biases and stuff like that but at the end of the day i think that quiet quitting is fundamentally happening because of something like effort inflation where going the extra mile used to get you promoted but it doesn't necessarily anymore and if that's the case then as an employer you've got to really think a little bit about how can i reward people who go the extra mile couple of other things to consider is instead of just telling people to take vacation like really think about why on earth would employee not take vacation right it's just a net positive and chances are there are things that you don't understand about the workplace you've created and this sort of gets to the last kind of general point that i have is that what i'm noticing is that employees are trying to shape employee behavior which sort of totally makes sense without really understanding the perspective of employees and you can try to shape employee behavior all you want to but i think it's like it's not about maximizing their motivation it's about recognizing that your employee is a human being and that human beings you know have desires and fears and want to do a good job they want to distinguish themselves and like trying to actually understand who this person is and why they do what they do is going to be very very helpful and when we've done even things like corporate consulting and we sort of take that approach which is like forget about productivity for a second recognize that your team is are human beings and what's going on with them and the cool thing is when we actually prioritize the human being we actually see an increase in productivity questions chat pause due to scroll oh my god so many things air season the managers are too overworked to do that beautifully put brilliant right and so like that's that's exactly what happened so here's the other thing that leads to like quiet quitting is that sometimes stuff just keeps on getting piled onto your plate and there's like scope creep for your work and so like i've seen this a lot where where i work with a lot of good managers who want to do right by their employees but the structure of the environment that they work in doesn't allow for that and the number one leading cause of burnout is actually someone trying to do a good job in a systemic thing that gets in the way and prevents them from doing a good job it's kind of it's bizarre but there's been a ton of research on this burnout doesn't come from overwork burnout doesn't come from laziness shockingly in fact the opposite burnout comes from excessive effort with minimal benefit so i get burnt out as a physician when i'm trying i i can work 30 hour calls and feel good about it at the end of the day i can work 30 hours in a day in a day and a half i guess they're like you know it's going on monday morning i leave tuesday at noon actually doesn't burn me out what burns me out is when i spend three hours on the phone with an insurance company trying to get medicine for a patient for a patient that needs this life-saving medicine it's when i'm spending a lot of work and i can't even help the person like i'm happy spending time to help people and this is where another thing that i kind of want to say is that for far too long in our society have we taken advantage of people who are doing altruistic jobs so for far too long we've taken i'm thinking especially of like teachers and people in the medical profession where these are jobs that we like value almost like on a moral sense right like you're saving lives and like since like we're educating children and it's for the children what we've managed to do is create situations where we take advantage of individuals altruism and so what i tend to see very very often i don't know if this is statistically correct or not i see employees getting taken advantage of the most in these two professions because you're saving lives like you're doing it for a good reason right so why are you complaining about the pay and what we also tend to see in both of these professions if you look at like tuition right and you look at like college education and things like that if you look at the education industry in the medical industry this is also where you see like tons of profit you
