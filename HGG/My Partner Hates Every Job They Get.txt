if he's not going to make the right choices or refuses to make choices if he's not willing to give sobriety a shot if he's not willing to give therapy a shot like if he's just like like basically turning the hourglass day after day after day hoping that something will get better and then you decide that this is not the person that you want to be with like i think that's totally fine and then when you do break up with him and he says oh like i knew like you're too good for me and like you can say like do you want to hear why i'm breaking up with you like what my reasons are my reasons are what you choose to do has nothing to do with your looks has nothing to do with you being a man-child or anything like that like all the psychological crap it's just how you choose to spend your time so my partner says that he will be miserable in every job he works he ever works my 25f partner 27m says that he will be miserable in every job he ever gets and it's working that makes him anxious and miserable he's currently working a service desk job he hates that gives him constant anxiety and panic attacks he feels trapped because he believes that quitting will be taking a step backwards and staying he will hate his life he feels behind in life and has said many times that he feels like a child in an adult's body who isn't ready for the responsibility of being full grown i sympathize him and understand work anxiety i used to get get a lot of it myself he's currently seeing a therapist but he thinks it's not working and she's not understanding his issue he feels misunderstood and issue and the issue isn't being solved i've told him it takes time to find a therapist who works for you but he doesn't believe me and thinks that no amount of therapy will help him he clearly has severe anxiety and depression but refuses professional help okay he currently uses video games and weed as an almost constant escape from his life if he's not higher playing a game he's stressing out about work and falling feeling behind in life i love him and want him to feel happy again but it's so hard when it feels like there's nothing i can say to comfort him or give him advice and he thinks that getting professional help would be useless he's stubborn and won't take steps to get better because he's convinced his life will be [ __ ] no matter what he does it's also really making me question my future with him if he feels like he can't hold a job and he often says i'd be better off without him i really need some help here and i'm posting to see if if i can get opini any opinions from the community nothing i'm doing is helping him and i feel helpless to improve his life so this unfortunately is an increasingly common situation where we've got one partner who's kind of stuck and the other partner like really cares about them loves them a lot you know has been in this relationship we're not really sure how long but oftentimes is committed to trying to make this relationship where can you love this person you care this person so you want to help them now oftentimes when you see these posts on the internet what you'll sort of get is like dump them and move on right like that's sort of the sentiment that most of the internet internet is quick to judge quick to abandon people quick to like you do you right and sometimes that that's that's not uh honestly it's not a bad option like there when we'll kind of get to that but the truth is like we should try to meet the person where they're at right so if someone comes onto into our community or just anywhere else on the internet one of the things that i try to do is just like meet people where they're at so the first thing is if this person has said i want to try to help my partner how can i do that it's not our place to say dump his ass and move on right it's like if that's what you want that's what we're going to try to help you do and in my experience supporting people who want to try to help their partner it's through a very sincere effort to help your partner and when you've tried everything and fail that's when sometimes it's time to move on and actually i think that that's like a healthy way to move on right because then you're not feeling like you abandon them you're not feeling like you didn't like you know you were mean you can leave that relationship sort of with a clear head and like a clear heart because you've done everything within your power but unfortunately you can't fix another human being so i'm a huge fan of not giving up on people and also like doing everything that you can but also recognizing that like there's a difference between giving up on people and doing everything and then sort of recognizing that like you've done everything that you can and there's nothing else to do so you're not giving up on them it's just like they need to do the rest of it so what i'd like to do is first talk a little bit about the boyfriend's situation based on what we've heard let's try to understand what this person is going through because i think sometimes people in our community are in the same situation right i've got a dead-end job i hate it it gives me anxiety i'm behind so i can't quit but i can't stay because i'm miserable people tell me to go see a therapist and i see a therapist but it doesn't seem to be helping and so it's sort of like and i'm smoking weed and playing games all day right like so it's sort of like i'm stuck like i can't improve my life but i can't take a step back i can't quit i can't get a break i'm using certain coping mechanisms because nothing else is going and like that's the only thing that's keeping me from like exploding internally right so this is a really challenging situation to be in so let's try to first understand like what the partner is experiencing so if we sometimes if we equip no uh the the you know the girlfriend with knowledge about what her partner could be experiencing we'll sort of set her up to better support her partner then we'll talk a little bit about you know what you can do as a partner and the last thing that we're going to talk a little bit about is like how to have conversations about leaving right so this relationship may not work out because it takes two to make a relationship work out and we're not jumping to that that option we're not saying that you should have that conversation now but i think that there are healthy ways to have conversations moving towards a breakup and the reason i call them healthy is because the reason we have those conversations it's not that you decide to break up with this person it's that you have a conversation where you signal to this person hey this relationship is not really working for me this is what i'm trying to do to fix it this is what i need you to do to try to fix it and sort of how to have a breakup in a way that you know like in a sense protects you not protect you but like that you can kind of feel good about yourself and also can give your partner some feedback so that hopefully even with the breakup you're sort of helping them move forward in their life okay so let's start by trying to understand the partner so let's go through a couple of things that we're sort of noticing about the partner okay the first is that he's 27 he feels like he's fallen behind okay what are the other relevant relevant details that you all think about what have you all kind of pointed out okay what have you all noticed okay so someone's saying mindset so how do y'all think okay so they've got work anxiety very good okay substance use to cope weed self cred so the mindset we're going to refer to is self-criticism okay so fallen behind trapped okay therapist isn't working very good okay we've got some five head stuff over here learned helplessness right okay good i like this one suicidal but not really suicidal brilliantly said right okay uh cycle of self-fulfilling placebo so we're going to include that over here that's correct we're going to talk about that self okay right so there's self-loathing okay excellent so i think this is pretty good like you all are doing really good so i don't know if you'll notice this but we're changing what dr k is doing so dr k used to just list all this stuff out right and then i'd walk you through it but now what are we doing we're asking chat and chat is finding a lot of the right answers look who's learning chat good job okay this is everything that i have on my list and even more all right so let's talk a little bit about what's going on so the first thing to understand is they said that they have crippling anxiety and panic attacks okay and then this causes them to want to quit work but if they quit work they're going to fall behind be a child etc you all see that so how do we fix this right so this is where presumably therapy helps we'll talk about that in a second but what do you all think ah someone's been paying attention very good the culprit here i mean i don't really know right so once again we're not going to diagnose and treat things but we're going to teach all some information if i had to say there's one big problem that needs to be fixed if you're in this situation it's the weed so this is where this is something that's kind of unusual so a lot of people will use marijuana for medication for anxiety right so they'll use it as like self-medication for anxiety but there are two things that weed can cause that is kind of interesting because we'll also use it as a medication for nausea in cancer treatment so there are two big problems with using weed on a daily basis the first is that it can cause something called rebound anxiety that's the a plus student second thing rare thing is it can cause something called cyclic vomiting syndrome we're not going to talk too much about cyclic vomiting syndrome this person should be glad that they don't have it but when we see a lot of chronic weed use the funny thing is that it actually causes like this this rebound anxiety that's really really bad so the interesting thing is that a lot of people will use weed to treat their anxiety because it's the only thing that helps them feel good but then once the weird weed fairs wears off the anxiety comes back sometimes even stronger than the original thing that you were treating and the more chronic your anxiety use the greater the chances that you're going to develop this sort of like rebound anxiety for with with weed so i know it sounds kind of weird but like if they want to have a better time at work what they really need to do is probably stop the wheat more than anything else they're also weed has all kinds of negative effects on motivation and also habit formation okay if you guys want more information like we have a video on our our youtube channel about smoking weed like in watching motivational videos are you someone who smokes weed every day and watches motivational videos on youtube there's also a whole section on rebound anxiety and dr k's guide but the key point here is that we develop a dependence on a substance to treat anxiety when the substance wears off the anxiety comes back twice as bad so the other problem with weed as we mentioned is that like it prevents you from or it makes it harder for you to form good positive habits and make substantial positive changes in in your life so the first thing to understand is like as long as your partner is smoking weed on a daily basis chances are that is making all of these things worse right so this is where like once again from a treatment perspective so your partner may not be willing to give up weed and like that's their choice right but like for you to understand what role the weed is having now the video games may also be playing a similar role but i think less so than the marijuana or at least we have less evidence from a neuroscience perspective from a clinical perspective you know i don't know that video games cause a physiologic rebound anxiety that is like really really profound generally speaking people who play video games a lot can sometimes be more anxious absolutely but that sounds you know like i just don't think it's as powerful an effect of an effect as we does now the second thing that someone pointed out is that your partner says that therapy doesn't work so people have heard of something called the placebo effect which is when my belief about something creates a physiologic benefit so it's sort of like a psychological from an inert substance this is what we call placebo it doesn't necessarily have to be inert but basically if i believe something will make me better it will actually like physiologically make me better the interesting thing that we talk less about is there's something called the nocebo effect which is essentially the opposite of the placebo effect which if i believe something won't work it actually won't work okay so we see this actually a lot as therapists where some people like don't believe in therapy oh therapy isn't right for me i don't need therapy therapy can't fix my problems so people come in with this attitude chances are that the the therapeutic effect of the therapy will actually be reduced so the good news is that hopefully most therapists are trained to actually deal with this right like i get a ton of people in my office who don't think that therapy will work for them so like i mean not nowadays but like back when i was working at a residential addiction treatment facility very common occurrence i get someone who's there for an alcohol addiction and i asked them okay so what brings here well my partner said that if i don't come here they're gonna divorce me oh okay like what so do you have a problem with alcohol do you not have a problem oh i don't have a problem with alcohol i don't need your help i don't need anyone's help this is just something i'm doing to save my marriage so i'd hear that kind of thing a lot so it's like oh okay so like you know if there's nothing that we can do to help you and you're just here for 30 days to save your marriage that's totally fine is there's like something productive we can work on right so like in order to make your partner your husband or your wife happy you have to meet with me three times a week for an hour so what are we gonna do like you want me to bring a deck of cards like you're here right so like what is there anything we can work on so you kind of start to talk to them a little bit oh well like you know like you know everything in my life is great okay like any work related stress any of these problems those problems you want to talk about like you know marital stress and conflict oh yeah like it's really hard like my wife is really not understanding oh tell me about that like what's it like having a wife who doesn't understand you what's it like having a wife who listens oh it sucks it's terrible i hate it it's like she doesn't listen tell me more about that oh my god that sounds awful man wow you know so it's it's kind of like you can get there right but and hopefully your therapists are trained at that so like you know you could you can get there and then suddenly like you know they're coming in and they're like oh man so like how this had that meeting with your wife go on thursday oh it was like you know it actually went better than expected oh really tell me about that well you know this happened this happened this time wow that's awesome dude it sounds like you're really like you know listening to her a little bit better and able better to communicate i know that you're only here to save your marriage but what do you think about like learning some communication skills over the next two or three weeks maybe patching things up so that you know not only is she happy that you did your 30 days of rehab but you know after that like hopefully y'all can build some kind of positivity while you're here what do you think about that okay we can give it a shot i'm here anyway shrug right so you can do that so the key thing though is that like you know if your partner or you yourself don't believe that therapy can help you you have to understand that this is going to like negatively impact your therapy and if you're if you have a partner who you're encouraging to therapy and they don't think that it'll help them like you have to understand that like if you don't believe that therapy will help you it will actually have a scientifically less impactful effect now hopefully you have a good therapist who will like win over your your partner right or like win over the person who's coming to their office demonstrate to them what the value is but isn't that sort of like gaslighting no not really so there's a huge difference so gaslighting is tricking someone into believing something is false okay the whole the way you trick someone into believing therapy is that you give them value from therapy that they were not expecting right and then you change their mind so i'd say it's not like gaslight gaslighting at all i'd say the best analogy is like oh hey like try this like the sandwich is really good you should really try it no i don't like sandwiches i don't like it well take a bite right even if you don't like it like oh i know you don't like it just take a bite you take a bite you're like oh that's actually pretty good you just get them to try it right and then they can form their own opinions if they can't find value from it they can't find value from it but it's my job as a therapist to try to like demonstrate the value that i bring especially when someone's coming like because they're coming right they're there to get help so the first thing that i've got to do is convince people and make my case that i can actually help you which is like one of the key parts of therapy is like you have to convince people that it's worth their time and if i can't convince them then you know maybe they don't belong there okay so be careful about the nocibo effect now what can you do as a partner about the nocebo effect the first is that there are a couple of other things that this person mentions one is that they feel misunderstood okay so if you feel misunderstood by your therapist what should you do what you should really really do is tell your therapist hey i feel misunderstood right and then let's see if you all can figure out what is the next question that a therapist should tell them what should a question at uh what therapist should uh what question should a therapist ask next right uh okay okay missing this one all right a little bit so you don't want to ask why you never want to ask the word why should generally speak speaking be removed from a therapist's vocabulary right yeah that's good so so we've got the right answer in there what am i misunderstanding okay right so that's the communication tip never ask why so why is that because why tends to have a judgmental connotation in our language so this is different depending on what country you're from but it's like if i ask you like why can't you stop playing video games why can't you stop smoking weed why don't you wake up on time in the morning right i could ask like i could be genuinely wondering like oh you know but it sounds like an accusation right so you all see that so it's not that it's actually an accusation it just comes across that way right you all see that so i mean you can still use it i sometimes use y but you have to like you you generally want to steer clear of it but that as a therapist you want to just ask you know what am i misunderstanding what am i missing so help me understand like if i'm misunderstanding i'm sorry like can can you please explain it to me okay um my therapist asks why all the time then i mean if you're working with them and they're good like that's fine so just so remember that i'm i'm a medical educator right so i'm faculty so it's my job sometimes to like teach therapists stuff so this is just one of the things that i've learned that i was taught that i pass on to people that i teach so you can i mean there's no absolute i mean there are some absolute rules for therapists but generally speaking like if your therapist uses y doesn't make him a bad therapist right in the court and judge and jury of dr k like different people use different techniques they may be really good at asking it i sometimes use y but i use it later on in relationships once like they understand that like i'm not accusing them of anything and they can kind of tolerate that once i know that that's off the table then you can ask why then it's very efficient okay um so okay so you could you should just tell your therapist if you feel like you're being misunderstood now this is gonna be a problem for your boyfriend because this will probably send them into a panic attack oh i can't tell my therapist that i'm being misunderstood so if that's possible you know you can ask them hey what would it feel like to tell your therapist that you're being misunderstood the other thing that you can always do is find a different therapist and i make that sound like it's easy but generally speaking like you know you can also do both concurrently so you can sort of say hey why don't we like try to find a different therapist um what do you think about finding a different therapist and at the same time like tell your therapist that you misunderstand them um so you can talk to your your partner a little bit about the therapy experience but in general if we want to understand like some of this stuff the main thing that we're going to get to some of this stuff in a second but the first thing is like be careful about the weed because the weed could be a big big culprit just as someone who's done a lot of work in addictions it just feels like people who are chronically using substances are just playing a completely different game like what's easy for them what's hard for them what they can handle what they can't handle their tolerance for work their tall their patience their ability to like manage anxiety and stuff like that the amount of anxiety that they experience just becomes night and day once you're sober so i've seen this a lot especially like alcohol and weed where like people just become different humans also opiates but opiates is so much clearer so alcohol and weed are the two that i don't think people realize like how negatively it impacts them like usually people who are you know [ __ ] up on opiates like recognize that they're kind of like screwing up their life and they're like not functional when they're using opiates whereas people think when they're using weed and alcohol in a daily basis that they're like relatively living life normally okay so next thing so so there's just a couple of things that you need to hopefully will will sort of help you understand your partner so as a partner what can you do okay so the first thing that you can do is listen so what i'm sort of i think you probably already do a good job of this but let's kind of like go through this um but it's so hard when it feels like there's nothing i can say to comfort him or give him advice so that's what i would that's what i would like i recognize that so this is the hard thing about listening is when someone shares a problem with us we want to make their pain go away right and we want to make their pain go away we don't want to just listen we want to do is help them and the way that we help them is by providing advice and also comfort right we want to give them comfort or reassurance we want to say hey everything's okay here's a road forward we'll figure this out together like here's how you do it like you know everything will be okay like don't worry you're growing up you're doing a good job right so like it's kind of interesting but even comforting may have the effect of infantilizing him oh it'll okay it'll be okay babu a little baboo oh it's okay you're gonna be such a big boy soon you're going to work at that job for 27 for seven more months and then you're going to be a big boy right providing advice can also be like you know you're sort of falling into the parent role you're not like a partner so you're saying like why don't you do this why don't you do this so i'm not saying you shouldn't provide advice but like just be careful about the possible effects right and this is really common like everyone does this so if you love someone you want to help them and when you want to help them sometimes you fall into these patterns that don't end up working and they can sometimes backfire and then you as the partner who like loves this person feel incredibly frustrated feel powerless because it's like these are the two tools in my tool belt why aren't they working what do i do it's hopeless so instead of what you should do is just listen so ask questions okay now this is where you know like you you shouldn't necessarily become you should not become your partner's therapist but there are some questions here that you could ask which go to some of these things so these are going to be your clues okay so you know i would even lay out for them and say like you know it sounds like you're feeling really trapped can you tell me about that like what's going on okay so you can start to like ask questions about feeling trapped falling behind right when he says i i'm so far behind i feel like a child in an adult's body you can say no no you're not you're clearly an adult in an adult's body i don't you know don't don't try to comfort or reassure just ask them like what makes you feel that way what is that like for you okay so you can just like listen so the way that i want you to understand this is here's your partner okay and they are hopeless right so here's what hopelessness is like it's like they're filled up with all this negativity and what they do is every time they use pot it kind of like covers it up some but all that negativity is there so when you listen to people what happens is we sort of like let that negativity like out okay and as we let the negativity out as they you just kind of listen and he gets his feelings kind of out you know the negativity will reduce on the inside and so i know it's kind of weird but like sometimes like really all you need to do is just listen just let them emotionally decompress and they can start to feel a little bit better hopefully they can start to feel a little bit more hopeful um so just listen okay there's more to it than that but that's the first thing to to do is just listen to your partner right if they say oh i feel misunderstood by my therapist oh what is it that your therapist doesn't understand now you may have a reflex to try to say okay well then why don't you explain it to them so don't give them advice don't give them suggestions in your mind for like two or three times a week for up to like half an hour or 45 minutes set in your mind that this is a conversation where i'm not gonna give any advice i'm just gonna listen right so two to three times a week you guys like talk like this for 30 to 45 minutes right just listen to what they've got to say if they've got to say something next thing that you can do as a partner is encourage some positivity so we don't want to be like uh how can i say this blindfully positive but what i'm hearing in this post is a lot of things that are wrong with your partner's life so sometimes what happens in our mind is if our mind is like filled with negative thoughts that are just swirling swirling swirling right like it just feels bad so sometimes what we can do is we can like insert some kind of like positive thought in there right so what what that just means like expressing gratitude having a good time like saying like you know everything everything here sounds awful but what we want to do is like not have you know you could there's got to be some stuff in your life that's good there's got to be some reason you're with him and you can just dwell or talk about that right so you can sort of say like hey you know i really enjoyed what we did this weekend like what'd you think of that movie oh did you see dune like man dune was awesome i'm so glad we went like what'd you think of the movie like you know you can just talk about something that's positive it doesn't have to be to the exclusion of negative things so like i'd say like you know one to two conversations a week where you all are dwelling on the positive the second thing that you can do to encourage positivity is just encourage certain kinds of positive behavior so this is where like i don't know if y'all go for walks but just like getting out of the house and saying hey let's go for a walk and then he's gonna say i don't want to and say like hey that's really important to me will you please come with me right so just ask him so like we'll get to that in a second but encourage some kind of positive behavior because right now there's a cycle of i don't know like video games weed terrible work and panic attacks so you just got to break that up with something else so like i would try to go for a walk if you can i don't know where you live i don't know if it's safe to go for a walk you know like would i just go for a walk like once a week twice a week and then like afterward you can express gratitude say hey i'm really glad you did that we did that how did that feel to you and you they say oh i was like it was okay it's like cool you know so try to do that a couple times a week next thing that you can do is let him help you so one of the things that's really interesting is if you look at people who are stuck oftentimes they can help other people even if they can't help themselves and we see this a lot in like addiction and recovery where once you start on the path of recovery and you start helping other people it like really helps you like grow as a person so like even if you can't help himself so this is why i would you know ask him for the walk like you can frame that as something that you need that you need him to do for you so that's going to give him like the opportunity to first of all like step up and do something in the relationship right so he's going to feel like less infantilized he's going to feel like he's contributing he also like makes the world a better place and like helps you out in some way you should always express appreciation afterward but let him help you ask for his help if you need his help with something okay you can say hey like i really need to get out of the house can you please take me somewhere right so if like depending on what your gender dynamic is you just like take me somewhere right so and like let him kind of figure it out and stuff like that and so that that can actually be really good but giving him the opportunity to help you can actually be very very healthy for him so and then at some point you know if you want to you can try to talk to him but this is really more for a therapist you could talk to him about the therapist right help me understand what's going on there like do you want to try switching i know you don't believe it'll help you oh by the way speaking of the positive you can also highlight a couple of things that are actually big wins here so this post looks like a bunch of losses but there are things that are wins which even if you share with him in that moment he may swat them away so be prepared for that but remember if you're trying to help another human being and they swat away some kind of positivity it doesn't mean that it doesn't have an effect it's just reflexive for them to swat it away right but like it'll still have some effect you know it's kind of weird but that's just how our mind works because his mind is trapped in this cycle so anything positive that you try to do he'll kind of like knock it away but it still lands in some way so it's hard to describe but this is just something once again from my experience i've come to understand is that they might not consciously like it may not make a difference to them but subconsciously it can absolutely have an effect so a couple of things the first is that they've still got a job right and so what you can kind of point out to them is like wow like you're suffering every day it sounds like your job is an absolute mess i think it's pretty amazing that you've been able like you have so much endurance to be able to tolerate that that's insane right like it sounds so awful and then like what are they gonna do you all have hopefully heard devaluing right it happens in all of our interviews oh no it's not that bad whoa what what what what oh interesting okay just leave it don't push it don't say like what do you mean it's not that bad what you like it tell me more about it no no no oh okay i didn't realize that it sounded pretty awful the way you're describing it other thing is there was one other win oh yeah they're going to therapy right so like wow like i really appreciate your commitment to getting better because i'm hearing that your therapist doesn't understand you i'm hearing that like you know you don't think it's going to work and you're going anyway like i really i can really like respect you for that because what that signals to me is that like even if things are hopeless you're gonna keep trying and that gives me hope because i think it's when we give up that like really things are at a loss but like at least it's got a chance of working and like i think it's really great that you're setting aside your own kind of prejudices against therapy and giving it a shot anyway so you can like encourage them in some way there are actually a couple of wins here right so when i look at this situation you know like if we remove the job and remove therapy so smoking weed all day bad anxiety playing video games feeling fallen behind feeling trapped two huge steps forward for this position person would be getting into therapy and getting a job those would both be steps forward right so this person is doing those like you can acknowledge that okay so those are the wins now let's say you do all this stuff and it's still not working okay so let's talk about breaking up now as we mentioned before this is the kind of situation where i don't know that we're going to need notes for this this is the kind of situation where a lot of people on the internet or friends or family would say dump his ass and move on right and like i can get behind that sentiment up to a point like i just said i think there are a couple of things that your partner is doing that are actually like a real step in the right direction which gives me hope that you all will eventually get through this so how do you know when to break up and how should you have a conversation about it so the first thing to understand is that like you can do as much as you can do but if your partner is not willing to put in the time and effort to change then either you have to accept the relationship and your partner the way they are or you should leave right so like there's there's no don't plan on him magically transforming one day but he is doing things that i think are really really important in that process of transformation one is that he hasn't quit yet in the second he's like seeing a therapist right so i also don't know the duration of time in terms of therapy but if he's been seeing a therapist for six months and doesn't feel like it's not helping that's a problem but let's remember that the the clinical trials on therapy usually have are looking at a minimum of eight weeks so eight weeks is sort of the amount of time it starts to help so then what we're talking about is like eight weeks to six months is really like two to six months is really when i hope to see a therapeutic benefit in therapy and then hopefully post six months you're just like getting better better better better and then within a year or two i think most people that i work with are like in pretty good shape okay so how do you have a conversation with him if you are getting frustrated and like you know what should you say and like should you break up with him is he terrified that he's you you should break up with him so this is where you know if he says things like you'd be better off without me and you can say like you know that may be true but i i'm choosing to stay with you the reasons that i'm choosing to say with you is because you're working on yourself so the main thing that i would emphasize here for what you respect and also what you blame when you break up with him is choice so like it comes down to your partner's choices so this is where a lot of people like even they'll say oh you'll be better off without me you'll be better off without me and then you break up with him right and then what go what happens is he leaves the relationship thinking all these kinds of like hopeless thoughts oh i knew it i knew i wasn't a good person i knew i liked like i would never be happy i knew she was too good for me and so you want to be careful because i don't think you want to let him get away with that what you want to emphasize is the reason that you're staying with him and the reason that you're breaking up with him this has to feel internally right to you or his choices right it comes down to choices usually so like if he's willing to work on himself if he's willing to make the right choices then you're gonna stick with it and you're gonna try to support him if he's not gonna make the right choices or refuses to make choices if he's not willing to give sobriety a shot if he's not willing to give therapy a shot like if he's just like like basically turning the hourglass day after day after day hoping that something will get better and then you decide that this is not the person that you want to be with like i think that's totally fine and then when you do break up with him and he says oh like i knew like you're too good for me and like you can say like do you want to hear why i'm breaking up with you like what my reasons are my reasons are what you choose to do has nothing to do with your looks has nothing to do with you being a man-child or anything like that like all the psychological crap it's just how you choose to spend your time so we've talked about certain things that you choose not to do and if you had chosen differently like i would feel good about this relationship but what i'm getting from you is that like you're not willing to put in the effort that it takes to change and i'm happy to try to support you if you're willing to put in that effort but i can't fix your life for you you've got to fix you know like i'm happy to help you but it requires some effort on your part and i don't think you're making the right kinds of choices i understand that sometimes those choices are hard i may not understand how hard they are they may feel impossible to you but they don't seem that way to me so and also like when it comes to like conversations about breaking up like if you're starting to lean in that direction i would talk to him about it and this is where partners tend to get terrified because they're like oh my god it's happening like you're gonna break up with me aren't you and you can say like no like i don't want to but this is what i need from you in the relationship to try to like stay in it like i can't carry this [ __ ] on my own this is what i need from you and this is where like sometimes like that thought can be shattering for a person but this is where we have to remember that this is like a romantic relationship between partners right it there has to be some point at which you're honest like the foundation of this relationship should be authenticity and reciprocity that's my belief so if you disagree with that's fine nick should you protect your partner sure should you support your actually support your partner sure should you protect them i'm not so sure so that's where like there should be a lot of positive encouragement i'm not saying jump to this conversation right i'm saying like there's a lot of other stuff you should listen first you should ask for their help you should point out all the good things that you're doing you should give them positive feedback support them in finding a new therapist if that's what they need to do tell them that you love them tell them that you're in in it for the long haul and also that you can't be the only one in it for the long haul right that they have to choose to try to do particular things and even if they don't want to make your choices that's okay right because we don't necessarily be controlling and say like oh you need to do x y and z like maybe with weed you know or if there's some things that are very significant that you know is like a deal breaker but generally speaking if he says oh i don't want to give up weed then you can say okay what else are you gonna do like i'm on board with a plan but tell me what that plan is tell me what you're doing to try to get better tell me what you're doing for our relationship and i know that that can feel like a lot for some people and it may be a lot for some people and those people may not be ready for a relationship because the whole point is that you don't want to preserve the relationship by infantilizing your partner because then you're just going to be like resentful and it's like they're not going to grow anyway right like people have to grow in relationships that's a big thing that people don't get is that you know when you start dating and you're 21 and you're both 21 that relationship is different from you when you're both 25. like you all have turned into different people so the relationship has to evolve and change so i would really emphasize choice and really think about choices like is he making the effort to try to put his life back together and if the answer to that is yeah i think it'd be nice if you stuck with him you don't have to right it's your your life and at the same time like if he's not willing to put an effort like you can't you can bring a horse to water but you can't make it drink and so like you can try to find him a therapist you can try to do this you can try to do that but if he's unwilling to have conversations with his therapist about how he's feeling misunderstood if he's unwilling to consider sobriety or talk about sobriety if it's causing all these problems right like if he's unwilling to do that stuff and sobriety is a big one because it may not i mean this may not be rebound anxiety right we don't really know but like i think at the end of the day it comes down to choices and then that way like hopefully if you do break up with him you can feel good about what you did right you can feel good about and this isn't just like an excuse to like live guilt-free no this is about being a decent human being and recognizing that like i did what i could and i could sleep at night because i did what i could like the goal isn't to like necessarily avoid guilt it's like i'm gonna be a good human being i'm gonna be there for my partner i'm gonna try to support my partner and also like i can't fix their life for them right that's that's the role of a parent that's not the role of a romantic partner questions so just to wrap up really common scenario that we see thankfully in this community which is awesome right that we want to help people that we love it's fantastic sometimes the people that we love are struggling really bad anxiety on the brink of quitting panic attacks at work if they quit they're gonna fall behind they're gonna feel pathetic about themselves smoke weed every day play video games every day try to go to therapy therapy doesn't work it'll never work i'm so broken it can't help me but he's still going so what do you do first understand him a little bit second thing think about how you're gonna interact with him right listen to him don't necessarily solve his problems for him he's like let him put his big boy pants on and solve his problems himself right that's going to give him self-respect so don't solve his problems for him support him in his endeavors you also want to be a little bit careful about you know how you encourage positivity so point out that not everything in your relationship is a loss and when good things happen appreciate those things ask for his help that's sort of like the secret technique when someone's feeling really really bad about themselves oftentimes they can help you even if they can't help themselves it's part of the reason why altruism is like a thing right it's really cool that being a good human being is like good for your own mental health next thing is you know at some point you're gonna have to probably have conversations about your relationship which could be moving towards the direction of breaking up and generally speaking you know i think the best reason to break up with someone is because of the choices that they make it's not because of how they look it's not because of their luck it's not because of their health it's the choices that they make right because that's really the only thing that's in their control and even if you break up with him and you say i don't think you made the right choices you're at least leaving him with the seed that this was something that was in your control and you screwed it up which doesn't that result in shame and stuff like that sure but that's the truth right that's life like we have to hold people accountable for their actions on some level right we may not understand them fully and we don't want to like judge but at the same time like we want to give him the message that you know what i fought you for is your choices and then they feel devastated because i i screwed this up and it's like yeah you did right but that also me like you can't you can't have the power to fix things unless you have the power to screw things up like the power is the same it's one and the same so you have to accept responsibility for your actions and if we chalk up your circumstances to things that are not your actions and that stuff is out of your control in the first place so you want to give him responsibility or not if you want to give him responsibility you have to hold him accountable to that responsibility and may it hurt him sure but that's like that's part of the process of becoming an adult like right is like recognizing that you have power and you can make good choices and you can make bad choices questions okay someone's saying my girlfriend is struggling with some mental health stuff suicidal issues i don't know if i really love her anymore and i have a crush on someone else i think i'll feel like a pos if i leave her because i still care about her but i don't know if i love her if i just care about her and don't want her to be sad suicidal so this is a really like in in this scenario right so sometimes we get caught up in a romantic situation where we have a dual role okay one is like caretaker or pseudo-therapist and the other is like boyfriend or girlfriend now when we think about a romantic relationship we think that these two things like should go hand in hand right so like it's kind of like till death do us part through sickness and through health so you don't want to abandon your partner because they got ill but at the same time if you've shifted like if their illness is so profound that you're not really like feeling like their boyfriend then that's kind of like it's a tricky situation right the other way to kind of think about it is if they were not suicidal would you break up with them and if the answer to that question is yes because you've you know because people fall out of love and like that's just part of life until hopefully you find the one and then it's really tricky because if if you would be breaking up with this person except for their mental health and like why are you staying in the relationship that's just really weird so i'm not saying that you should break up with them because of their mental health but at the same time like if you're feeling like the relationship is changing i think you can also in a sense stop being their romantic partner but still care about them as a friend and say like hey i'm really here for you i'm gonna help you like you know get your mental health and stuff in order i just don't know that i feel like comfortable being your boyfriend anymore because i'm just not feeling those kinds of feelings she's like are you breaking up with me and you're like well sort of and i wouldn't start dating your crush though like i would give her some time right but like it's okay to tell people like hey like i think it's you know like i really care about you as a person i just don't know where this relationship is right now and you can try to support her but if you're not you know if you're not feeling a romantic connection anymore i wouldn't rush out of it and jump into another relationship just because you're crushing on another girl that feels bad i would try to genuinely support this person and try to help them get their mental health back on track kind of give yourself time and space to like see what feelings arise but so i wouldn't abandon them but at the same time you don't have to like you don't have to stay in a relationship that you would have left a long time ago because your partner is like kind of suicidal right like a romantic relationship is not treatment for suicidality mental health treatment is treatment for suicidality and sometimes the two can get really conflated and you can feel really guilty sometimes you should listen to those feelings i'm not saying you should dump your partner and start dating the crush like that feels like an ass kind of thing to do so i'd give it some time and definitely try to help her don't leave her hanging but you can also like take a step back from some of the romantic aspects of the relationship like don't have sex right like say like can't you gotta give that up if you're transitioning out of a romantic relationship i think anyway people may disagree seems to complicate things immensely um i fear my partner would leave me for someone better i don't really make bad choices well that's their choice right so i don't know why you think that's other people out there are better than you are and if you're making good choices then your life is probably on the right track and if your partner wants to leave you for someone better let them and then you're going to continue making your good choices and then you'll run across someone who will respect you for the person that you are and respect the choices that you make if your partner wants to leave you with someone better right you're going to be the best human that you can be and the partner that you want to end up with is the one that recognizes that not the one that you try to trick into staying by you know changing the person that you are to try to avoid them from like finding someone else who's better like you be the person that you are you be the best version of yourself you try to grow as a human being and as long as you're trying to keep your partner from leaving you like what you're not a jailer right like your partner is not a prisoner they're free to go anytime they want to relationships are based on choice and so you just be the best human being that you can be and let them choose to stay with you or not stay with you someone else is asking um my therapist only has counseling every three weeks i have a feeling i'm not getting anywhere am i fomoing or is this a legit worry i'd say that's a legit worry so if you look at so people say that therapy is effective right so it does things like reduce symptoms of depression and anxiety and even like improve schizophrenia and things like that so when we make that claim it is based on a certain dosage of therapy so generally speaking the clinical trials on therapy are one hour a day once a week for a minimum of about eight weeks and we're usually looking at months so let me put it to you this way if you had pneumonia and you got prescribed an antibiotic and let's say you get prescribed azithromycin okay so you're taking 500 milligrams a day if you suddenly start taking 500 milligrams every three days if you're using the dose at a third of what the recommendation is you're not going to treat your pneumonia so there's a certain effect size that is generally speaking necessary for therapy i think i'm you know a bit rusty i mean there are you know cases of brief psychotherapy for example like brief intensive psychotherapy there are also cases of once a week psychotherapy once a month psychotherapy generally speaking as a clinician i'll see people once a week for an hour until they get into a good place and then we can start spacing things out okay let's check in every two weeks as they start to learn coping mechanisms as they start meditating as some they start to get better at communicating then they don't need to see me as often so it just depends like but generally speaking if you're not getting better and your dosage is small like i'd up the dosage uh do you know if meditation can cause mental disorders trigger a psychosis or something yes absolutely there are scientific studies of that i will just show you quickly right people are wondering can meditation cause psychosis absolutely right this is a paper from 2007 i'm sure there are other case reports reviews things like that so i think this is a good conclusion meditation can act as a stressor in vulnerable patients who may develop transient psychosis with polymorphic symptomatology the syndrome is not culture bound but sometimes classified in culture-bound taxonomy like qigong psychotic reaction so can meditation cause psychosis sure anything that can help you can hurt you right oh wow i missed something okay all right let's move on yes chats oh this is a good one this stream always makes me feel worse is that bad yes i don't know why it's making you feel worse but you don't necessarily need to do things that make you feel worse the stream is supposed to help people and if it's having the opposite effect like i it's because sometimes like feeling worse is like up on the road to healing right i don't know how to put this but you know when you're like sore and you stretch a muscle and it kind of hurts but it like sort of feels good over time like if it's that kind of worse then sure but if you like leave stream and you're like sad all day long because of what the stream did then don't watch it right we're not we're not perfect now if you feel like attacked but you gain insight and then you start to make positive changes in your life that's fine we're happy with that but you know if it's not helping like you know i've seen no studies that show that dr k is always helpful and makes people feel good like there's no such science that exists so we if it doesn't help don't do it i mean i'm not saying just leave but you know someone's asking how do you stop repressing okay look we're gonna get to this post in a second we're gonna talk about this don't stop repressing okay repressions are there for a reason and when you're ready for it then it's time to open the pandora's box but like there's a reason so remember most of the stuff that your mind does is good for you right like that's the way it's developed so i see this a lot with people who have like trauma and there are even studies about this so there was a study not one many studies that have been done on like brief intensive processing after traumatic experiences and so a group of like psychologists who were like we're gonna save the world went to some trauma-stricken sudan or something and they were like let's process your trauma baby they're like tell me about how much you were starving and tell me about what happened and oh my god where's it like to starve and then what happened and then what happened turned out that they like re-traumatize people right so we've stopped doing that thankfully as a profession i don't blame those people they thought they were doing the right thing they were smart they did research they respected their results they did not contin conduct scientific misconduct they didn't lie about it they're like oh this was a mistake we should stop doing this awesome job good job psychologists your attempt to help the world actually hurt it and then you owned it and then you told everyone else hey we need to stop doing this it's awesome right so we learn that's what we do with science so if you're repressing things don't just go and unrepress them now do you need to unrepress some memories to heal and stuff sure but do it in a safe slow manner when your mind is ready right you
