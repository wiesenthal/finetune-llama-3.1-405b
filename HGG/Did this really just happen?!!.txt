i have an announcement to make something has happened over the last couple of days i don't know if y'all were paying attention but womp womp womp one million subscribers so over the last couple of days we have reached 1 million subscribers on youtube this is a huge achievement and it is our achievement so when i say we hit 1 million subscribers why do i use the word we is it because i'm just trying to be friendly and i'm sort of saying oh like it's we because like we're all in it together no but literally i don't know if you'll understand this i cannot hit a million subscribers on youtube i can't make a million dummy accounts and hit the subscribe button to hit a million subscribers on youtube is only possible like literally only possible if y'all are a part of it too and i think this is actually huge because what it tells me what it makes me happy about what it makes me hopeful about is that there are at least a million people out there who are interested in learning about themselves growing a little bit and making the world a better place so we here at healthy gamer all about aoe healing and that involves y'all it's not just dr k and it will never be just dr k and it's never been just dr k and the awesome thing about our community whether you look at youtube like subscribers or comments or whatever is that like if y'all read the comments on our videos so much of the aoe healing doesn't even come from the video it comes from like the participation the sharing the you know comments the supporting each other the memes and it's like really actually a huge sign because it tells me that the work that we're doing is important and that it's helping people and that we need to continue doing it and that there are at least a million people who are on board so that is when i say we hit a million subscribers i i literally mean we right so it's it's awesome that we've come this far who knows how far we'll go i'm not really too focused on what's next i think our attitude at hg has always been to just kind of focus for the most part on today i mean we do a little bit of planning for the future but it's not about trying to hit 2 million or 5 million or whatever it's about doing the actual work of aoe healing and trying to help as many people as possible and if that number is 10 000 if it's 50 000 if it's 100 000 if it's a million if it's 2 million whatever right that's not actually the outcome that we're interested in the outcome that we're interested in is what you can find in the comments of youtube videos it's what you see on chat it's what you see on our subreddit it's what you see on discord which is people slowly putting their lives together getting control of themselves and like starting to build a life that they're happy about so thank you all very much for all of your support we really do appreciate it you know it it fuels the work that we do it allows us to do more things different things better things stuff like that so we we're very very grateful
