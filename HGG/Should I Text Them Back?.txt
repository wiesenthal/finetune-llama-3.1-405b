there's a reason why we end up in these situations we're not looking we're not running around trying to be disrespectful to ourselves at the end of the day self-respect is about who controls your happiness in life so whether you're happy or unhappy is dependent on her kissing you cuddling you then blocking you for five months without any kind of explanation is not an acceptable thing to do as a boyfriend girlfriend or friend it's not an acceptable way to behave as a human being the truth of the matter is that sometimes we're sort of not starved for affection but like addicted or have some kind of really important emotional need met by another human being so how the hell do you have self-respect like where does self-respect even come from what is it [Music] she unblocked me after almost five months hi everyone my year-long friendship has ended about five months ago i thought we fit perfectly same interests the same sense of humor and similar life goals we used to spend almost every weekend together going out watching movies and cooking together this was easily the best relationship i have ever had fast forward to five months ago this entire breakup situation lasted about a week it all started with her giving me mixed signals flirting wanting me to stay longer staying overnight touching kissing cuddling you choose after one of our cuddling sessions after i came back home she sent me a wall of text saying that everything between us was wrong and that we shouldn't have done that and we are better off cutting all contact after that she blocked me literally everywhere whatsapp snapchat facebook phone number i was devastated to say the least spent countless hours crying not eating anything and skipping my workouts started to look like a zombie lost 15 kgs of weight in a month and lost interest in anyone and everything it took me two months to start doing stuff it's been three months since then and i was desperately trying to forget her but well that didn't work she has been in my head every day for the duration of these five months both daily and at night i learned how to live without her sort of and accepted the fact that we will never meet or talk again fast forward to yesterday i saw that she unblocked me everywhere first i thought it might have been an accident but there are way too many steps to unblock someone for it to be random i couldn't resist and texted her yesterday didn't get any response but she didn't block me again so i guess my theory of randomness has been debunked i'm pretty much sure she has seen the message because she was online a couple of times during the day should i wait and hope she will eventually answer i think you don't unblock someone after such time for no reason am i right i really want it to work out again because i i know i haven't done everything perfectly in the past this whole situation just confuses me and doesn't let me function normally alrighty so we're gonna go to the comments a little bit so top comment have some self respect if she wants to talk to you she will don't build your identity around someone who discards you when it's good for her being desperate is repelling okay um hey her name do you want to talk about things between us life is shirt short i'm well assured okay so two options right one is have some self-respect so what i want to talk to you all about today is how does one develop self-respect what does that even mean right because we find ourselves in this situation unfortunately and like when you say have some self-respect like it's such a damning judgment right so like let's start by understanding that there's a reason why we end up in these situations we're not looking we're not running around trying to be disrespectful to ourselves the truth of the matter is that sometimes we form relationships with people and that this relationship can feel amazing it's the best relationship i've ever had like i connect with this person the truth of the matter is that sometimes we're sort of not starved for affection but like addicted or have some kind of really important emotional need met by another human being we can feel loved we can feel enjoyable we can feel like oh my god this is amazing i enjoy spending every moment with this person that's not a lack of self-respect right that's like being in love that's not a bad thing and then something can happen you know this person blocks you after sending you mixed signals and stuff that sounds quite traumatic and when we get something pulled away from us dramatically like when something is really great in my life and i really enjoy hanging out with this person we watch movies there's also kissing cuddling like it's moving in the right direction i'm getting a little bit excited like where is this going to go like i'm not really sure and then suddenly like this person is taken out of our life and we've been with this person for a year like they've been our best friend for a year it's absolutely traumatic and we always want to like go back to what we've lost right and this is not something i mean this person isn't pathetic or anything like that i really don't believe that because you have you know kids who do this with parents all the time where parent is withholding of affection doesn't tell my kid i i love you or you know we have the typical asian parents no racial offense here but i really recently stumbled upon asian parent subreddit but you know there are a lot of stories in there about like parents who withhold affection unless you get a pluses and are the smartest kid in the class and despite the fact that these people hurt us we are wired to try to get them back to try to win them over so it's like it's a reasonable situation to be in but you know there's something that kind of like resonates with like have some self-respect so we can say that right i'm not saying i mean that was the up top comment the other comment was good too it's like hey try to talk to her try to resolve things right like communicate that's what we do at hg we engage with our problems but then the problem is that like no one ever tells you like how do you get self-respect right have some self-respect it's like oh [ __ ] i forgot to pick oh let me like go to home depot and pick that pick up oh yeah self-respect where can i find oh i'll too let me go pick that up okay now i've got it easy done fixed saved so how the hell do you have self-respect like where does self-respect even come from what is it okay so the first thing to understand is that when you're in a situation like this and people say have some self-respect understand what your emotional needs are which are like completely legit okay just like you met this person and she's is it a she i'm not even sure let's assume heteronormative for a second i think we did right yeah she unblocked me okay so like that's normal for you to want that right you want everything that you've had before so when we don't when we when we lack self-respect what we tend to end up doing in in essence what a lack of self-respect is is chasing after happiness from another human being at the cost of ourselves so we're looking from a benefit for a benefit from another person and we are willing to sacrifice our dignity to get that benefit right so like i'm willing to do whatever it takes to get this job i will do your dry cleaning i will take out your trash i will on i will plunge your toilet for you if you need to whatever it takes to win you over so we sacrifice of ourselves to get happiness from another person and so why do we call this a lack of self respect because now this person is thinking oh she unblock me let me message her should i do this should i do this should i do this and what it is is this person is addicted to what the other person provides right so they're willing to debase themselves i'll message her again i mean they're not willing to do this right because it sounds like they sent one message they're being very introspective they're reaching out for help they're doing everything right this is actually really awesome but when we think about the classic person who has no self-respect and comes crawling back right because she really hurt you what she did was not okay like kissing you cuddling you then blocking you for five months without any kind of explanation is not an acceptable thing to do as a boyfriend girlfriend or friend it's not an acceptable way to behave as a human being she may have been feeling anxious she may have been feeling confused and all that kind of good stuff so generally speaking when people say have some self-respect what they're pointing out is that you're letting other people mistreat you you're letting other people do things that are unacceptable and you are not holding them accountable why don't we hold them accountable because we want what they're selling i want to see those movies again i want to cuddle again i want to talk again i want my partner back i want my best friend back and so i'm willing to sacrifice whatever it takes to get them back that's when your self-respect goes so what is self-respect how do you get it so right now you're willing to sacrifice yourself to get happiness from outside of you and without that happiness from outside of you you're going to feel alone you're going to feel hungry right because you don't have all of those things so self-respect is actually choosing pain self-respect is saying that you know what i'm not going to let myself have her again right i'm going to give her up like she blocked me but i have held on to her and we sort of see this because it is like i haven't been able to get her out of my thoughts you don't get her out of her your thoughts you give her up or you let her live there rent free for a while and you just tolerate it right she's living there rent-free and you're just like okay i'm not going to try to give her up this is the price that i pay for getting attached to her i think this is the the issue is that at the end of the day self-respect is about who controls your happiness in life and when you surrender that control to another human being even if you're addicted to it i can understand right when you're addicted to the happiness that she provides and you let her dictate the terms of the relationship what you're doing is you're putting your happiness in her hands so whether you're happy or unhappy is dependent on her there's still a choice there and it's does she message you back or does she not message you back so you're surrendering that control and that's when other people when when one human scene sees another human being surrender their self-control that's when they tell them to have some self-respect so how do you get your self-respect you take that control back why is it hard to take that control back because oftentimes taking that control back comes with pain i'm not saying that you should block her but you tell yourself i'm not going to message her again right whatever it is you take control of the relationship you take control of your own feelings even if it means choosing the painful route so like when we think about the phrase dignity right like to live with dignity is to not is oftentimes to choose things that are painful right so if someone comes up to me and says i'll pay you 10 million dollars if you let me take a picture of your scrotum and it's like i'm gonna say no but they're like what about the benefit that's exactly the point is that the benefit can be whatever it is i am choosing to keep control over my life a smart bad example what a terrible idea right my point is like don't like turn down the money right like whatever it is turn down the happiness like you should retain control of yourself even if it means a path of pain right so like when you choose to act in accordance with your values and you say like i like even if it's my choice even if it hurts it's my choice and so the challenge here is that like you've got a choice you can either give her up or you can give yourself up and that's fundamentally what a lack of self-respect is it's when you give yourself up for the sake of another person you surrender your happiness to like her texts whether she texts you or not determines whether you're happy or not and then we say like that's a lack of self-respect so how do you stop that you take control taking control means giving her up right so do you want to have do you do you deserve this is where the self-respect comes from because if you respect yourself do you deserve someone who will treat you this way or do you deserve someone better because if you let someone mistreat you and you think of yourself as low then that's okay but if you deserve better then you're gonna move on because that's the end of it but i want her i miss her okay so what but it'll hurt to not have her okay so it'll hurt accept it that's life that's what living life with dignity is dignity comes with pain doesn't come with pleasure people who seek pleasure don't lead dignified lives quite the opposite right when we're chasing dopamine or drugs or materialistic things or the respect of random people on the internet right when we chase after those things and we'll do whatever it takes to get other people to like us that is the degradation of self-respect when you play someone else's val opinions and view of yourself above your own and so you say i'll do whatever it takes to get you to like me then you lose your self-respect and so why is it hard to get self-respect because you have to pay the price of other people not liking you you have to give up whatever the [ __ ] this was that you had with this girl which i still don't understand what that was right it sounded like a friendship that was turning into a romantic relationship she doesn't know how to communicate this is where like i don't disagree with the second person who's like you know give her a chance to talk which i think is fine if that's really what you want to do but you need to be centered before you have that conversation man you need to be prepared to reject her before you have that conversation you need to be prepared to hold her accountable for her actions because if you don't do that then you're signing yourself up for this all over again because unless there's accountability for her actions and i know this is like a man talking about a woman but it definitely goes both ways or homosexually or whatever one human to another if someone treats you wrong in a relationship you need to be prepared to hold them accountable and if you don't hold them accountable don't expect the behavior to change and so then like you know you're gonna come groveling back like you know i understand why you do it i don't think less of you for doing it by the way which i know sounds weird he's like that's a need that we have right we're addicted to that love we're addicted to that warmth we really want it so bad that we're willing to sacrifice anything that doesn't mean that we're pathetic that just means that that's a some damn addictive relationship stuff there right so we need to respect that as external observers we need to respect that this person's choice is actually very hard it's easy for me to say help some self-respect moon when i'm not the one that was cuddling with her right i'm not the one that was watching movies with her i don't know any of that benefit i watching movies so we're all willing to debase ourselves for like some of that sweet sweet whatever the hell that is so have some compassion for randoms on the internet who are like making bad choices right it's not easy to make why do people make bad choices because they're easy that's why we make the bad choices because they're the easier choice well we're going to blame these people for making bad choices we're making them right and left center all the time so how do you get resp self-respect it's simple choose the path of pain give things up if they don't make you behave in a way that you are comfortable with don't let people mistreat you even if they're like crack cocaine right and that's like literally what we see with like drug addicts is that they will be willing to debase themselves to get that next fix and that's just a drug what if it's like love and cuddling and movies like holy crap man that's just not a hit of dopamine that's like feeling loved y'all that's what this person has to give up that's the price of self-respect so it's a hard choice to make don't get me wrong how do you make it you recognize that this is not the way that do you deserve to be treated this way yes or no because if you respect yourself the answer to that question is yes and if i'm sorry you don't deserve to be treated that way then the answer to that question is no if you respect yourself right i do not deserve to be treated this way then you have to have the balls or the ovaries or whatever you're going out of choices to hold that person accountable and holding that person accountable sometimes means giving her up does it mean blocking her if sure if that's what you need to do does it mean a conversation sure does it mean a conversation where you say hey by the way what you did was kind of [ __ ] up it really hurt me a lot i'm incredibly angry with you oh i'm sorry how can i make it up to you invent a time machine go back in time and don't do it but i can't do that yeah the hurt that you set my way is irreparable it's done right like like not all hurts can be repaired so like look people are saying bass sigma chad move look y'all it's it's just respect yourselves right don't let people mistreat you don't blame yourself if you let people mistreat you that's an important point because i understand that if you let people mistreat you there's got to be a damn good reason human being self-respect is a natural state of things right but like dude come on man like for those of y'all that don't treat yourself with respect i don't know how old this person is but like do y'all i mean i i remember what it was like to be 21 i remember what it was like to be 24. i remember what it was like to be 27. you're not like that high level yet so you're going to be making these mistakes it's okay to make these mistakes right that self-respect comes with time it comes with sacrifice really because it's it's it's like it's really powerful to say to someone like to give something up like i cannot if you guys want to talk about meditation we'll talk about fasting so like to give something up is the first step to self-respect this is why fasting is a thing in religious traditions multiple reasons but that's one of them i think what started to happen is people have lost sight of why we fast to begin with she's like i'm gonna like give something up for lent for example in the catholic church like the whole it's not like okay i'm gonna get like we're not gonna eat fish for a month so like let's just eat lots of other delicious food no that's like missing the point the whole point is self-deprivation the whole point is i want this thing and i'm not going to have it the whole point is that i choose what i do and i'm not going to let the temptation of an external substance usually talk about food right with fasting dictate my life and is it gonna suck sure is it gonna be less tasty yes absolutely so what
