there's sort of this global social skills atrophy so we're going to be talking to him a little bit about his perspective on men's mental health dating and a couple of other topics so um yeah we're super excited for that so just a reminder that mental health awareness month is May and so we're doing a lot of really cool stuff here at HG stay tuned to our various channels we'll be streaming um across different platforms uploading stuff in various places we've got YouTube videos coming out um laughs I'm still on The Struggle Bus in terms of my of some aspects of my personal health but hey that's okay so uh a couple of other things so we're trying to pick the things that we think are going to be the most impactful to y'all so we did a deep dive into understanding trauma which I I think we got a lot of positive feedback on so you all are free to check that out um last Friday we did a deep dive into addiction so how can you understand addiction as a process the addictive personality we didn't go into a whole lot of details around particular substances but just what do you as a human being need to know about addiction sat stream was last Friday and then um I think we're streaming this Wednesday as well so stay tuned so we've got a lot of great content kind of coming out for y'all um and we'll even have something from the community that hopefully y'all will enjoy that'll be coming out later this month so stay tuned to all that the last thing that we're going to be doing uh during May is traveling a lot so I think our modern wisdom the we were a guest on the modern wisdom podcast which just went live we were on steak and eggs recently so we're traveling around this weekend we're going to be at the American Psychiatric association um doing some stuff there so stay tuned to that so we'll be traveling around to different places and trying to help people wherever they are um so you know thank you to everyone who's been a part of this community so far y'all are the reason that we are where we are uh we really hope that we've been able to be helpful to you and that's really what we're focused on just a couple of quick updates you know for those of y'all that are interested in more in-depth education like Beyond let's say a 20 minute YouTube video check out Dr K's guide that's where a lot of our I would say like kind of Timeless information or perspectives is stored there so if y'all are looking for a comprehensive approach to depression and that sort of includes clinical stuff but also like spiritually like how to find purpose in life how to deal with things like existential problems that's all in the guide to depression there's a guide into anxiety which teaches us a lot about just how our mind functions our guide to ADHD and doing stuff which is about ADHD but also like doing stuff so what I tried to do there is figure out okay like everything that I've learned about the Mind from seven years of training to become a monk plus becoming a psychiatrist how can we kind of reduce that to information about like how to understand behavior and how to like get stuff done and then of course we have our meditation guide for those of you all that are interested in in-depth perspectives on meditation I think um the ADHD and the the meditation guide are the most popular and so if you all are interested in more than what we can provide let's say in one stream or one video that's to be found in the guide we also have a lot of really cool community events going on this month um so kruthi our CEO did a an event last week on entrepreneurship

our coaching program so cool let's hop in with Charlie okay Charlie you ready alrighty let's hello hello hello I do not see your camera oh wait is it maybe it's me hold on I don't see your camera that's the only thing but we can move there we go all right hey man how are you I'm doing great dude how are you excellent on the meat let me put you on I have a big screen in front of me let me blow this up awesome all right now it's like real life yeah dude what's going on man not too much I'm very excited a little bit nervous I have not done live streams in the past so this is a new thing for me yeah well um you know I think it's just a conversation I think people are oftentimes a little bit nervous at the beginning but I think as we get into it I'm sure it'll be a good conversation yeah um can you just start off by telling us a little bit about because I I don't I don't know that everyone knows who you are I'm pretty sure most people are familiar with your content but can you tell us just a little bit about what kind of content you make and what kind of you find interesting about it yeah so um the the most recent thing is I'm actually not very involved with Charisma command but what I started with that you're definitely referring to which I'm known for on YouTube is charisma on command uh and that is a YouTube channel that was birthed from my own shyness at the time I was very introverted uh and felt that I missed the memo on how to comfortably interact with other people and so approached it in kind of an analytical way okay and then shared that on the internet so what that looks like if you might have seen our videos or heard my voice is I take some of the most popular people out there a lot of the Marvel actors sometimes singers or athletes or that sort of thing and talk about what it is that they're doing in their interviews and other videos where people seem to find them you know fascinating confident connected all those sorts of things yeah so so it started sorry let me just fix one thing real quick sure um I'm trying to uh oh give me sorry about this there's one technical difficulty no sweat that we are trying to fix live and I'm gonna try again sorry about that okay GG I am so one of the things that we are give me just one second they're all good I I've uh this is why I don't live stream but I've been in this position before so I totally understand okay almost done [Music] okay done I think okay good enough sorry about that so so it sounded like you started with uh um Charisma on command to kind of conquer your shyness and then um so what are you up to now so I'm in between right now um the uh trying to find the aligned next project and I've started with the podcast which is how we got in touch reached out to you to have a conversation also have worked on the side on a Dungeons and dragon show uh which is literally right over here yeah total hard left turn but is very much in line with where I came from was the more reserved nerdy bookish guy uh and so we filmed two seasons now one of which were in the midst of releasing to a small audience uh which is Us in costume and accents playing dungeons wow dude and and what do you what do are you a player in in this d d show are you like DM or what okay yes I'm a player though I I think actually what I'd like to do is learn to DM I love the collaborative storytelling and setting up a playground for my friends to participate in is just a very gratifying experience so I've done a handful of just off-camera DM things that I've had a great time doing that's awesome man how long have you been playing d d uh about a year and a half I think we picked it up around pandemic time we were trying to find something to do that was uh new and different and I could be done inside without you know all of the in-person interaction uh and that was where we found Dungeons and Dragons and I it was a shame that it took me so long to you know because it was around when I was a kid but I think I don't know it was either too nerdy or had the reputation of being too nerdy that I never gave it a chance but when I found it it just it connected in a huge way absolutely man so I I play D D kind of growing up I was also a nerdy kid yeah and super shy and and really enjoyed it and it's it's interesting even now I realized part of what I loved about becoming a psychiatrist was that I really like stories like I think that's the one thing that I really enjoy about life so I used to read a lot um you know even in terms of like gaming and stuff like I liked stories I liked the Cooperative storytelling aspect of d d yeah and um even with my kids now when we do like bedtime and stories and stuff well it'll be like a little bit Cooperative where do they get to make choice is about what they do I love that and so it's it's a lot of fun and and what I really love about being a psychiatrist is like hearing people's stories and like oftentimes they are far more riveting than most of what you see in in fictional portrayals yeah yeah have you uh played it all as an adult or has that fallen off since you were a child um so I've played eight times in the last two years I would say we try heroically but as my friends and I have gotten older and had kids and things like that it becomes harder to to meet up but we try sure yeah yeah no that's the hardest thing is to get that Weekly game going for a bunch of adults that have different things but that's that is though that honestly is the hardest part of getting a stream is to find five people that can commitment yeah that's cool man that's why that's awesome that's that's a really big pivot I'm I'm really curious about you want to tell us a little bit about how you decided to do that or what was going on sure um yeah I was feeling burnt out of Charisma on command uh for a number of reasons one of which is that I didn't know my this about myself at the time but I when I feel most alignment is when I am what is uh fun for the audience and educational for the audience aligns with something that I am learning I really enjoy going from zero to one but I don't enjoy doing the sequel so if I was a director I would like making the first Avengers but not necessarily the second the third Adventures I like figuring things out for the first time and I felt that I'd gotten to a place with Charisma on command where I was applying the same analytical filter to just new people every week and that was losing uh I was losing connection with with the thing that got me there in the first place as the business grew um and so for a number of reasons one self-reflection but I've also had the Good Fortune to do some therapy in the past and have things like breath work meditation I've done psychedelics and those opportunities for deeper in a reflection uh connected me to the place that Charisma on command was born from was which was that Curiosity that love of being on the edge and in the present moment and Charisma on command had gotten to a point where I was I could I was doing it for memory I was doing it not from this place of like Cutting Edge present exploration but from I know how to do this this is old hat and so for that reason I needed to to find either a new angle on the company or something entirely new and I decided to to just make that hard left turn yeah that's awesome man so can you tell us a little bit about I'm curious have you had any experience with ayurveda um you know it's so funny my friend just brought this up he told me that I was a vatapita yep you're absolutely um and so I a previous iteration of me would have been very skeptical of these uh different kinds of modalities especially ones that were older traditions of you know what do they know but I find myself sincerely curious and I just just learned that and I'm trying to find uh the the more traditional wisdom all those sorts of things I'm trying to incorporate so I would love to learn more about it and and how you might apply that to you know me or anything it's it's uh you have what what I would describe as a very classic problem of yeah you know your best work is an exploration and wrote stuff becomes very very boring I'm also um and so I I sort of have noticed the same thing about myself that like doing the same thing over and over and over again gets boring and that I do my best work when there's some amount of difference or innovation um and and I understand that so we reached out to you because we wanted to talk a little bit about Men's Health and potentially like shyness and dating or is that I mean but it's not doesn't we don't have to focus on those things uh I am so that I can do that again that's all in me where I find that I'm most interested is the newer mental health exploration but there is a cross-section between those two that I think is uh we can we can probably find uh the things that led me towards the more outward looking Men's Health dating can I make women like me and how that has evolved over the course of my life too how do I feel about myself and why was I looking outside for some of that reflective validation that sounds perfect dude can you just tell us about that Journey absolutely um so it was very shy growing up and uh that wasn't a problem for me because I had my core group of friends until I I you know hit puberty and I wanted girls to like me and that became a a pain point and I also think I didn't know it at the time but that was there there's a weighing mechanism or can feel like you're judged by your male peers sometimes by if you can get girls to like you and that became sort of uh in some ways an indicator of masculinity even from that that adolescent age and so I didn't know it at the time I think I had both sincere authentic desire to connect with women but also uh what does this reflect about me and I became very curious and interested in um how can I be more outgoing can I be the leader of this group of people what can I do to get this girl to want to go on a first or second date with me and so that took me into the whole era of my 20s uh which was really extroverted outwardly focused where my Mantra was don't be yourself Choose Yourself and the wisdom that was present there was I have these old habits they are not reflective of who I am deep down because I'm just being shy all the time and I'd like to choose a more outgoing engaged personality so that I can connect with people I didn't know it at the time but I was also probably far too willing to not far too willing was appropriate for that age but for right now I was trying on a bunch of different personalities and I didn't necessarily have the discernment at the time to know oh this one is core to who I am and this one is a bit of a performance and so my 20s were amazing I traveled the world I lived in multiple different countries lived learned different languages practiced Jiu Jitsu traveled with a group my friends that were really tight and built the business of Charisma on command and then towards the end of my 20s was in a relationship that ended and I was in heartache and I had suspected that having achieved everything I want the million subscribers on YouTube doing well financially had a great group of friends and and a girl that I liked but I was probably sadder than I'd ever been before after this breakup and that started a period of the last five six years which has been okay I'm not going to go to the world to try to meet every single need I'm not going to say hey I feel lonely let me go hang out with a person or hey I feel like I'm lacking in status let me see if I can you know enter into this group uh where are those holes inside of me and so the last five or six years has been a recapitulation and a deeper understanding of who I am why I behaved in some of the ways that I behave which were not necessarily bad but I think we're motivated by a sense of lack and scarcity um and trying to find a deeper inner peace connectedness with myself from which I can then go out into the world and like oh there is a sincere extrovert in me but it's not this forced extraversion that I felt I had to do in order to be liked or outgoing or those sorts of things so that's that's the broad overview of where I've been and within that there's you know a million sub stories that we can dive into any one of yeah dude what an amazing journey man so it sounds it sounds very um developmentally appropriate is the term that I would use right so like shyness and then um sort of sort of focus on the extroversion and then sort of being performative and then recognizing like hey I'm trying to fill internal holes with external things yeah yes and then than therapy psychedelic spirituality and meditation for this phase right totally I and I'm glad that you said that because I can sometimes mistakenly say I was doing it wrong back then or I shouldn't have done that and and really when I'm actually aware it's like that was perfect or the phase of my life that it was I needed that experience I could not have left from shy to grounded in myself I needed to go out into the world to find that you know which of the needs can I meet by interacting with other people and which of them have to be met from inside of myself um so I'm really happy that I have that phase I don't discourage people from doing the types of things and the exploration that I did but just for me right now I'm so much more interested in the inner World um than you know what to say to get the girl to like you or any of that kind of stuff and I'm happy that I have those videos cataloged because if somebody asked me that question I could say hey I talked about that a couple years ago and this is where you can sort of find that answer yeah so I wondered can I follow up on one or two things yeah yeah so um you mentioned that you know part of this this journey of Discovery has been sort of figuring out what's a part of your core personality and what feels a little bit more like performance how do you tell the difference oh well I've I never had this mechanism before at first it felt like everything is closed you try them on you do it like I had I don't know that I had a connection with who I really was and even the shyness that I experienced as a kid was a bit of a cover for who you know for what felt like me these days I find myself from a felt energetic sense of connection with my gut and my heart um and I it's when I'm aware for instance of my butt against this couch and my belly and the breath in my belly the words that come out are honest they are authentic to who I am but when I can get into like this sometimes agitated sometimes nervous sometimes excited state I could come up into my head and now I'm just saying things that sort of make sense uh but lack the you could call it alignment or Integrity uh of connection with with deeper parts of myself um and so that's like that that noticing has been incredibly powerful for me uh and I would I had no mechanism of doing that when I was younger and so when people would say just be yourself I was like oh man what lazy advice that is totally inactionable and totally wrong but I see the Deep wisdom in that though it is you know potentially very hard to apply yeah so speaking of actionable stuff I mean it's can you tell us a little bit about how you went from shy to being extroverted and kind of traveling and and building Charisma on command what was that just like that was so um I again didn't know it at the time but it was uh did it with a bunch of close friends and there was wonderful pieces of that but there was also elements of codependency so there was a lot of like um healthy pushing one another but we we formed a web of needing one another in a way that I think grew past healthiness but that was necessary at that time in my life so we had a group of of guys and the Mantra was if something scares you but is not dangerous you have to do it and so there was so like you know I want to go talk to that girl or there I'm at a networking event and I admire that speaker but I don't want to you know go up and tell them that I read their book and I appreciated it and that Mantra served us incredibly well it opened up tons of opportunities The Rush that you get no matter how it goes with that person is uh so affirming and makes you feel like Superman you're like oh my gosh the world is such a uh is so much more full of possibility abilities than I felt it was before so we had a couple of like you know rules about uh how we would engage with the world and then afterwards we would discuss what went well what didn't go well where did I get screwed up um and so we took that sort of mentality out into our lives uh eventually I read the four hour work week and within that it was talking about finding where your passion meets a market need and the passion that I had was in understanding how I could transform myself to be better like by men women alike and so that was where Charisma and command started within that it had the idea of forming a muse business so that you could travel the world and trying to retire early in life rather than saving that traveling taking the middle of the day off doing nothing on a Wednesday for 65 we said okay what if we could do this at 23 and I think at 24 I moved to Brazil we lived in Brazil Las Vegas Vancouver Medellin Colombia traveled around and did all of this stuff with a group of friends in in those different places and so every day was uh Tim Ferriss style optimized you know we had we had all of our little sub goals that we would hit social uh related to health and what we were eating if we were working a little bit on the business and then having fun and we would like you know grade ourselves at the end of each day so we were hyper optimized it was a ton of fun uh and I'll pause there if there's anything within that that is uh of Interest yeah so Charlie I'm I'm um hmm I'm trying to think about what so can you tell me a little bit about how you found this group of people like what were those conversations like where did these people come from yes so one of them was my best friend from 10th grade um and so we uh talked to each other and it was a lot of like sharing the mentors and books that we had so the four hour work week was one of them uh the book that made me realize I could talk to girls was the game and I was like oh my God you can go out and you can use pickup lines and girls will like you um fortunately we we adjusted that approach fairly early in our but that was that was eye-opening to me that you could get a different reaction based on different things that you said um and then within that my friend and I started um going on internet forums and we offered like a five dollar class on the things that we were learning via skillshare and so 10 people showed up one of those people dropped out of college and came with us at another class we went to that guy cream like dropped out of his thing and came with us so we were we had a an awe a real Aura around us at the time we had a sense of uh infinite possibility uh you know you don't have to do the nine to five you don't have to be constrained and that attracted people pretty powerfully we were also fairly Evangelical about it we couldn't shut up about it and that was a mistake that I think we made was rather than having the security and groundedness enough in our decision to leave our job and go abroad there was a codependent desire to persuade everyone that this was the best way to live their life as well and so I definitely you know there was good things that came to that which is we convinced I think nine people to quit their jobs and move to Brazil but it might not have been the best choice for every single one of those people I'm super amazed by your Insight you know I was noticing an internal Judgment of generally speaking when we're Evangelical it's the person we are trying to convince the most is ourselves yes yes um and and and I'm just so fast I've never heard of anyone doing this kind of thing because it sounds like you guys are like uh you know you're like a crew yeah is going about and trying to extract the most out of life whereas we were the Gringos we were the Gringos in every country that we went to this roving band of guys um we were I think all like solid human beings and and tried to spread good Positive Vibes wherever we went but uh it was it was a really special time and I I look back on it uh very very fondly and so what do you think what do you think y'all were looking for you know I'll speak to myself because I have seen everybody is not everybody some of us has come around to a similar place that I have which is like oh I see the healthy young man exploration of the world in there I also see the drive of I'm not enough let me layer all of these accomplishments on top of this core of lack in order to feel enough uh and then I can be confident then I can have the things that I want and then I will feel excellent um so for me what I was looking for at the time I mean some of it was like I wanted a way to live my like I think what I'd seen in my parents generation and my dad in particular was someone who sacrificed professional satisfaction in order to provide for his family um and that I don't think was I wish that he'd had another option or found another option but when I thought of that I was like that seems soul-sucking it seemed soul sucking for him and I didn't want that for myself but one of the things that I wanted was to create from my heart and to love what I did for work to love the thing that generated money um and that was part of it and then uh I know I was also looking for validation from other people I wanted people to like me um and I was looking to become someone who who I thought was worthy of a tremendous amount of validation but within that there was also a bunch of healthy exploration and travel and we learned languages and so there was there was um you could you know the shadow was mixed in with the light in terms of what motive hitted me at that point in my life yeah it's really interesting how um you're kind of touching on a particular behavior Can we tend to think about things as healthy or unhealthy but what I'm really appreciating about the way you're describing things is that it's like neither or both right there's healthy exploration and then there's also essentially gratification of the ego which stems from things like insecurity and yeah two is developmentally appropriate for someone in their 20s yeah totally totally so finding uh finding the Forgiveness to say the type of nuanced thing that I said and that you reflected back to me which is yeah it was totally appropriate for the time frame and one of the things that has been frustrating is because I was so energized at that point in my life and I had a winter session I would say in my early 30s where I needed to like stop going out as much slow the travel down uh shrink my circle and myself and uh oftentimes I ask myself can't we just go back to that crazy fun exploratory period that was so fun and I've realized it that was perfect for that time but I'm no longer it's no longer appropriate and I'm no longer capable of having this that you know entering twice into that same river if you will to use the old Parable um so yeah and and you've mentioned this term codependency a couple of times what do you mean by that uh so for me what I mean is I think that there's obviously were an interdependent species we need one another in important ways um when I think of a healthy dependency I think of authenticity and Clarity in communicating your needs to someone else I think of taking ownership appropriately of for instance if I'm feeling anxious and I'm seeking a compliment for you from you I might do all sorts of uh backdoor ways of getting it from you that can be blown out at at length in a relationship and becomes codependent because now I am not being direct and I'm getting my needs that are appropriately met by me from you so that that's what I think of when I think of codependency is both a combination of indirectness inauthenticity and an unwillingness to meet certain needs so what we wound up with I think it's some of the friendships were lopsided relationships where the weaknesses in one person would never get addressed because the one the other party would always hold that particular thing and so one of my things was I am very uncomfortable uh or I'm changing this I had been very uncomfortable in saying when I felt my boundaries crossed when I felt that uh my needs had not been taken into account and in having a calm perhaps a bit angry conversation but uh for me that was either I didn't feel it at all never brought it up never said anything or it built up so much that I was so angry about it and had held resentment for so long and there was not this appropriate level of you are crossing boundaries this needs to change a stop or and this is the thing that I've never done I never broke up with any girlfriends I need to step back from this relationship so that has been a process for me as well as going um I'll pontificate for a moment here but I I can see I conceived of love as the primary piece being closeness then the most important part of loving someone was that you maintained a very close relationship you saw each other off and you talked all the time um and what can get sacrificed for me is either if if someone's needs aren't being Met Myself themselves something else um and then what happens is for me I stop accepting them the way they are and I start coming up with strategies or things that I can do to transform or change them so that my needs are met as opposed to saying the most important piece of Love is acceptance I can see where you are in your life and I can communicate to you but if you're unwilling to meet a need what is appropriate is with love to separate to a farther thing maybe we don't hang out every day maybe we see each other once a week and I've had to uh and what I've noticed is that if you could then you can maintain the love the love the love can sustain throughout that and not develop into resentment but I built up many relationships because I was so unwilling to step away from so many relationships that uh resentment pain um and just you know a lack of alignment built up in several areas of my life that that I needed to to adjust um are you comfortable with me asking you a couple more questions about that whole scenario because I think it's incredibly insightful and could be very illustrative yeah yeah I want to be careful to protect the identity of some people but I would love to talk about this topic yeah absolutely so yeah I applaud your boundary setting there yeah um really more talk not so much about a particular person but just your relationship with those things if that feels comfortable yeah yeah and just let me know if I overstep or something there's a thousand other things I can ask you okay sure so what did it so I you laid out this scenario and let me just see if I heard you correctly that you know so love meant closeness so those two things were almost synonymous and so something about accepting someone and oh so that was one piece and then the second piece that I kind of heard you mention was that if you had an unmet need um not any unmet need but maybe some need that is related to the relationship in some way and if that person was not able to meet that need was not willing to meet that need didn't understand that you wanted them to meet that need um then you would engage in behaviors just try to sort of squeeze it out of them and I apologize if I'm kind of putting you in a bad light I think it's really common no no it's able to do that I do in my relationship um relationships and and so over time what you really discovered is that okay like if you're expecting this person to meet your need and they're not meeting that need and you're not able to articulate that that can over time lead to some resentment yes and and I'm also hearing or reading between the lines here that something it was you had to come to some realization in order to distance yourself so can you tell us a little bit about does that sound accurate so far by the way yeah okay that feels right so um what I'm really curious about is what what made it hard for you to distance yourself what did it mean to you to stay so close um one of the things this is I mean energetically is I think I didn't know this about myself but I think I'm fairly empathic meaning like I can when someone else gets upset I feel that in my system and uh I mean I can I think this one I can share is that uh there's probably a fair degree of enmeshment between me and my mom when I was young uh and I felt her anxiety off it she's a fair she's a fairly anxious person and to mitigate that I made adjustments in myself so I'm sorry I've sort of lost your question but this does feel like the root of of what you said you haven't lost my question okay okay this okay so I'll we'll come back to exactly what you said but I'll establish this as sort of the ground that I've uncovered is that um I could confuse my feelings and my needs with someone else's very easily very very easily and I can give examples from this um once you know a small one was uh remember wrestling as a kid and it my mom and the audience you know they're very frightened for me and uh my experience of it was I was one of the youngest kids and I came in second place that was like awesome and her experience was fear and panic but for me what that totaled up to is I quit wrestling you know I I I felt the stress of causing that panic in her made me not want to do that thing and so one of the behaviors that grew out of that is I learned never not just with her I do not struggle publicly it like when somebody sees me struggling that old it triggers this old thing in me this old discomfort of I am burdening them in a way that is very uncomfortable for me to experience um and so I you know just in re-understanding I used to tell people oh building the business was nothing so easy I I never did any homework I never studied and going back and be like oh my God I paid so much close attention in class yes I never studied but I would put my head down and fake sleeping so that so that people wouldn't think I was working hard I mean there were these like adaptive behaviors so just to give an example and then catch me back up so I'm coming back to your question now I I love where you're going okay you have more to say or oh I mean I could I could go Ad nauseam about this but the uh what this what I have learned is that there is a way to discern what my feelings are and what other people's feelings are that was a trial and still is for me to really sort through and I think it affects everything it's a Hallmark of now my relationship with my girlfriend I think started from a place of uh the familiar I have total control everything that everyone feels is because of me that's a very familiar comfortable powerful safe place for me to be for her she was happy to play the role of you know a lot of what I feel is because Charlie did something or didn't do something and we've had to within the last year and a half really take a look at the places that for me make me feel powerless which is your feelings like there are things existing in you my girlfriend or you any person in my life that I did not cause that I cannot fix that I cannot mend or or make better and my job is to sit with my own discomfort with that and your job is to tend to your needs dick you know tell me when there's something that I can do directly that could help meet a need in you and own when that thing isn't working for you and there's something else that you need to find in yourself and so that process has been just playing out in so many areas of my life I set like I'm a codependent velcro thing like I find ways to hook into other people and it is often in a way of support help advice and what I have not been capable of doing that I am learning to do is sit old space listen uh allow people their struggle without interfere Hearing in it when it is not asked for wow so quick question love everything you're saying yeah are you okay not answering my question directly sorry so take me back to the question exactly forget about the question for a second if that's okay well it's okay I can't how do you how do you feel if you don't answer the question um how do I feel like I've let you down like like you wanted something for me and I didn't I didn't know I did give it to you all right yeah yeah yeah but you're not responsible for my feelings right that's exactly what you're learning and it's so beautifully Illustrated because here you are you're like oh like what was your question again like bro honestly from the bottom of my heart pure authenticity I love everything that you're saying okay I I don't the question is from my perspective the question is just to hear more of what you have to share I'm not looking for anything is that that the first time someone said that to me I went right you know I like rolled my eyes and uh I appreciate that that is something that I need to that is so hard for me to allow to sink in I'm not looking for anything when it is authentic and I believe you that hits my nervous system like I want to let it in but oh God I'm afraid to yeah and it's uh gosh I I'm so excited to continue learning to receive that because what a yeah what a relief that that would be yeah I mean so if I can share something else about that so to put it simply Charlie the reason I'm not interested in you necessarily answering like if you do great is because I think what you have to share is the most valuable thing the valuable the value that I'm hearing when I just listen to you speak is not in a particular answer like I'm looking for this bit of information you gave me that information or you didn't give me that information honestly my my authentic feeling of this conversation is just hearing you talk like whatever you want to talk about like I don't care it's just your representation of your experience the way that you're describing things I mean the way that seriously it's like I mean you might as I don't know if you've ever formally studied psychology but you're fluidity with the concepts is is amazing and part of what I actually really appreciate about what you're saying is that your fluidity with the concepts is very experiential and so I think that if you have two psychiatrists for example talking about and maybe you're a psychiatrist and I just don't know but um talking about something like in management or codependency it's going to be so clinical because in psychiatry our perspective is from the outside looking in so we like describe behaviors as opposed to describing the subjective experience so I love talking to you because I think the way that you describe things will actually resonate more with the average person than two experts talking about it got it yeah because what like this this example about wrestling right where I'm noticing that you feel really and even the reason I kind of poked you there and let me know if I crossed a boundary is that I'm noticing that wow this guy is like real it's really important to him to answer my question and even though he's sharing something really valuable he kind of keeps coming back to it and and so I think that that's a good example of you know the wrestling story and and even in terms of your relationship like um you know just how tricky it is especially in a relationship because if you look at relationships to a certain degree we're responsible for our partners feelings right like it's our job to help them feel better and that's what especially a romantic relationship is about and at the same time we can cross the realm into toxicity so quickly if we become solely responsible and the other tricky thing that I oftentimes see in these kind of codependent relationships is that as you start taking more of that space your partner starts taking less and then eventually the burden of their feelings Falls to you and you feel wholly responsible for their feelings yeah and then you know you don't have 100 power and then that leads to a whole host of challenges in terms of you trying harder being more controlling um you know as well as them sort of dumping the responsibility on you and both you all agree that if they feel a particular way it's your fault which is really when relationships become very difficult yeah yes that I that all hits yeah um I'm trying to remember what my original question was but I I mean I I mean I'll just say what you reflected to me um I appreciate it it you helped put me a bit at ease and you are right that there is I want people to get what they ask of me and I worry that they don't and your your indication is a really powerful way of saying that I think increasingly the right people for me will want me you know they will want me and and not that I'm never going to have a tantrum or a fit or a problem but that the thing that they will generally come back to is your presence your you know the the you-ness of it all is the value and there are times in which I might ask for a particular favor and I guess I would like that thing but generally this relationship is built on you me connecting yeah beautifully said man yeah so um can I keep asking questions please please yeah so so you talked about people want the Eunice of you how does one figure out what the Unice of you is I mean I will I could try to I'll tell you subjectively for me um psychedelics were incredibly helpful um did it in a safe space with a facilitator and all those things uh gosh I mean I I'll take you there um when I was little I was molested and one of the things that that did with me was it created a profound sense of confusion in me of who I was um secondarily to that which was also challenging and I didn't again I didn't know any of this at the time my perspective on the time was it this happened it didn't bother me it was totally okay some people are bothered by that but I'm just one of the lucky ones that did not get affected by that and that was true for 20 plus years I like was aware vaguely that this has happened and as I've Revisited in psychedelics one of the things that happened on one of the nights was I was freaking out having a very hard time and in my belly was like you tell this guy that was taking care of me at the time tell them you're gay tell them you're gay tell them you're gay and I was like no no I could do that no that's not and and it came up I said I'm gay and then it didn't taste right didn't feel right in my throat and what came out after was I just burst into tears and said I was molested and what I have found in me is that there are often these blocks these things that I am afraid that represent confusion of what if this were true and for me it was you know growing up in the 90s gay was the thing that you said to someone to insult them it was the the wrong thing to be and my era I think a lot of people at some level hold well I won't tell I won't say what other people but what I held was totally okay for other people to be gay but this is not okay for you and so the fear of things that could be true about me I think stopped me from exploring what was really there and so that's just one example the inability to truly go am I did do I you know that that that curious exploration was off limits and so the deeper thing which was behind that was this experience happened to me I have convinced myself that I liked it in order to cope with it and what was deep deep in there uh after you know more Journeys was how painful this experience was how um I mean I thought fast forward I eventually through this convinced my family and my parents to join me in like an MDMA journey and in that uncovered oh this is hard uh with my dad I was able to share with him the devastation of that experience for me something that I was so ashamed to share um and particularly how hard it separated me from him and I felt I couldn't go to him anymore was what I felt I felt uh crushed and just uh like Soul crushed I I was was the way that it felt and just the shame at which was heaped on in other ways in this relationship with this person um dictated a lot of my personality for a long time the avoidance of things that made me feel shame and so the the meanest of me oftentimes has come through acknowledging and experiencing and feeling pain because it is my pain and these are things so I realize probably what has happened is things that are me I separate from and I create stories that are more comfortable so rather than being the me that is in pain that had this experience happen I'll be this other guy who is totally fine totally cool totally happy and I built up a whole set of habits over the course of my life of being something else to the degree that I forgot what it felt like to check who I was inside and I was so used to different mental images of myself that became me that yeah that I lost contact with with the meanest so for me it's been a process of in many cases uncovering very difficult emotions shame pain self-loathing all of these other things feeling them as fully as I can and in that I touched deeper into who I am um and a lot of that confusion is resolved authentically rather than resolving that confusion with a statement of I'm straight you know or like any any sort of dictate that I might put out into the world I can I just feel who I am much more clearly these days yeah I think it's it's beautiful um I mean I I don't I don't mean to say I understand I understand what I honestly I what it ended with was I was just how you felt who you are instead of defining who you are your words you know and I I think we see that so much right now where people will talk about I am a this or you know I'm a leader I'm an alpha or whatever right instead of like being one and and I I've kind of noticed it's I I I really love a lot of your insights Charlie just about how it's almost almost a little bit mutually exclusive I don't think that's precisely true but that you know the more we talk about who we are the less the more we Define our identity by words I think we sometimes get away from ourself and we'll strive to be particular things but I'm also hearing a very you know honestly great journey of trying to Define yourself in a particular way learning a lot about positivity and growth and and learning a lot about okay if you do set your intention in a particular direction that you can actually make progress I hear that your 20s were were sort of like a period of empowerment really sort of like yeah a disenfranchisement early on followed by empowerment and then now you're kind of into this acceptance phase where it's not about power or lack of power but whatever you are is what you are and that's hopefully enough yes yes I think the 20s and they were wonderful but there was a bypass going on in my 20s it's like can I just teleport to confidence can I speak the confidence into myself can I speak the inner okayness into myself um the uh achievement affirmation all of those sorts of things as opposed to the path that I've taken now is I am going to sit with and move through the exact opposite of what I want to feel which is self-loathing or shame or confusion and rather than resolve any of those things I will allow those things to be resolved by being with them and the profundity of being with is something that I am just beginning to understand and learn uh I was always a doer a fixer a changer if you like I'm great with advice I've got a YouTube channel full of it but what I didn't have in my internal system in my life and I didn't see the value of was being with people being with myself in experiences that were just uncomfortable um I just tried to change whatever I could to to bring back that state of comfort as quick as possible and I see um the immaturity in that now yeah I think uh it's interesting I've never heard the word immaturity used to describe that but yeah it makes a lot of sense yeah um and I I think that you know the avoidance of pain is frequently what gets us into the most trouble I know one thing I've sort of noticed is is a psychiatrist is that people tend to avoid pain first of all which makes perfect sense but honestly I've seen just as many lives ruined by positive emotions and being uncontrolled being out of control with your positive emotions yeah and I'm not just talking about Mania I'm talking about falling in love with someone I'm talking about you know really love is destroyed just as many lives that I've seen that you know hate has which sounds really bizarre to say but I've kind of seen it in terms of what people will tolerate because they love someone um what people will inflict on someone because they love someone and it's sort of like this possessive sort of Love um and also who the other people that you were willing to hurt if you are in love with a particular person yeah yeah I my my sense and totally uh I use the word in the same ways that again I feel like that for me is Obsession you know what I'm what I'm learning is that there is um the way that I'm trying to experience not trying uh I'm genuinely experiencing love it's tough to hurt someone from the love that I am increasingly feeling versus the love that I did feel which is what you described was possessive obsessive uh and it was actually very much about what this relationship fills in me which is why I will go to these links to deceive or get what I want or you know hurt someone else or do any of those sorts of things in it um and yes it it felt like an intoxicating experience but only because I was not aware of the deeper wound that this was acting as a salve for yeah I I would say that what I'm sort of hearing there is it can really be summarized with this phrase I don't know if you're familiar with like attachment and Detachment from kind of Eastern philosophy but this is what's kind of confusing is in the west we tend to think about emotions as like positive or negative in a clinical perspective I think we have a slightly better understanding that you know there is no such thing as a positive or negative emotion emotions are just emotions but generally speaking I think what the yogis kind of figured out is that it is not an emotion that is good or bad it is our relationship to the emotion which determines whether it's helpful or harmful so there are two Sanskrit words attraction the vaish is repulsion and essentially if we are attached to love then it becomes obsessive and similarly if we are repulsed from shame then that becomes harmful yeah so it's when we're kind of tranquil with each one whether we allow them to be that we actually form the healthiest relationship with our emotions which is those are just emotions beautiful I love that I find myself increasingly called towards Eastern philosophy Eastern uh traditional medicine and those sorts of things I found um again I feel like I really have done the Western thing and I've gotten a lot of value it's not a western thing uh the the main thrust that I have seen to me when I think of the west I think of sort of uh Victor Frankel I think of finding meaning in pain which to me is making this moment refer to something else like rather than sinking into the moment let's find something larger something bigger that we can connect this moment to to confer something onto this moment and the Eastern thing seems to be can I stop referring this moment to something else and be in this moment can I have presence uh for what is and not need to necessarily connect it to make it mean anything it can just be and I don't know if that's how you experience it but for me go ahead I would say there's um so I think that that is both correct and there is something on the other side tell me about that so um so let me start by asking you just one more question that I'm happy to explain so when you say okay so what's your understanding of what the goal of the Eastern perspective is so uh and again these calling anything the Eastern perspective I recognize a ton of stuff but when I feel it it it feels like presence would be the one word it would be entering into the now um and seeing the beauty of what is without needing to change alter or or shape it and there's also the you know the Dao the going with the flow allowing yourself to become one with the everything broadly so that's my that's my broad understanding yeah yeah so so I I think I think well said and I'm not you know I understand some Eastern Concepts but it I'm not objectively you know the the knower of Truth by any means but what I would say is that you know being in the now is actually the first step and and I really love the way man Charlie I just love the way you talked it so I love the way that you're talking about meaning or sorry pain as a referential thing right so what we're going to do is we've got this experience and instead of sitting with the experience we're going to derive something out of it right we're going to distill it into something that's valuable so we're going to take a negative and we're going to transform it into a positive the problem with that is that there is a fundamental judgment that the negative is worse than the positive and so we're still moving away from one thing and moving towards another thing yeah now there's a lot of good research around why that's healthy so if you look at post-traumatic like the research on post-traumatic growth and post-traumatic stress disorder what we sort of know is that as people go through these terrible experiences like genocidal experiences that there's a they're two camps of people and some people will develop psychiatric illnesses and some people will sort of become stronger and then that can be the same group of people eventually people will kind of go down the route of post-traumatic growth and and a key just sort of like scientifically important part of that is the development of meaning or narrative around your experience yeah so Victor Frankel I'm kind of with you um but I think the really interesting thing is that maybe you'll you'll get there one day or maybe you'll arrive somewhere I hope so let me know is that I I think that there is a being in the now almost you'll eventually see that there is this transcendental purpose as opposed to a referential purpose I don't know how else to describe it but even being in the now is part of even if you talk about the Dao or the flow that that there is a Continuum of stuff and that is really what like that purpose is it's not purpose in the microcosm it's like purpose at the macrocosm and I even think when I worked with people with trauma really when I there's sort of the referential purpose but there's also like a Transcendent purpose that people can get to which is like recognizing that that too was part of my path almost in the same way that you are and and to recognize that what we're talking about with purpose is that like in life I am what I am the now is the now and then this is the progression of my life and that's okay and what I'm supposed to do on this planet on this Earth in this life is to just go down the path that I was meant to go down and this is where some of these broader Concepts like Karma which I think are are very poorly understood like you know I think these really start to come in and and you know being in the now is great but it's interesting because I think that that Duality is actually dissolved the further down you go I like it yeah I'm definitely not there but I could have I had Peak experience of that let me see I've had moments where it feels that uh the where I've been able to be with the now and look back and go oh I feel the connectedness of all of this I feel the uh beauty of this path that appeared to have gotten off course because this thing wasn't supposed to happen and it was so wrong and it shouldn't have been that way and it should have been different and now without forcing it I think one of the things that that um again is healthy for a phase but that I'm trying to ease off of is to take some of these profound ideas like everything happens for a reason and repeat it as an empty affirmation to oneself that is not sinking in a deep level but I've been able to recently to sink into that the depth of that to us too too deeper and deeper degrees and uh with authentically sinking into it and I see what you're talking about how yes it's not just this point it is this flow this River this larger this larger thing yeah so I I think when we talk about these Concepts like Dao or Dharma Dharma um karma karma that I think it's all like the same thing and there's this weird sort of transcendental kind of thing it's also interesting because I I would even that I would encourage you to examine whether so we're talking about it I'm talking about it as if it's on the other side of where you are right now right because you're working on being present and stuff like that but I would even it the more I'm hearing you speak I wonder if actually you've gotten a glimpse of that and interestingly enough the more that you realize that there's Transcendent transcendental purpose the easier it becomes to be in the now yeah because if this is all a part of my life I don't need to do anything except for be here now and present and that is sufficient and and it's almost quite liberating if you get a glimpse of that to recognize like you know this is just what I'm supposed to be and so I don't need to be anything else and then it becomes easy to be in the present yeah yeah I appreciate that that this is actually something very pres you know to my this last week these couple days that I've struggled with um the old me felt on my path when I was working in my Tim Ferriss optimized way with my four things achieved every day not like that that made me feel on the path and I sense a larger path that is asking me to let go of a lot of those things and to have more space less rigidity to how I just for this phase in my life not forever um and to let something larger percolate and and Bubble Up and the glimpses that I have had that move man yeah I feel it uh there's a knowing that is semi-obscured in me that I both long for and fear of the um the gift of my life the way that it is headed what it has been and yeah the depth of beauty that that will become and all those things and what I can get stuck in is fear that I didn't do what I needed to do today to make that happen uh and so I I appreciate what you've said and I'm working with like when you have the glimpse of the the larger transcendental it's like no it's all working out inevitably perfectly as it needs to be it makes these days where I don't have a podcast or I haven't produced a video or I haven't done something it lets me understand that they contribute just as much as those days where I am totally productive and and make the thing happen in the way that I you know was used to doing you know what I feel for me and again I think that there's different stages I think that there's some people that really need to um they need to get on their grind and they need like that's that's where they are for me uh the this where what I do that I'm not even totally aware of with space and silence is probably even more productive than what I do with activity and um and and you know contribution in the traditional ways that I'm that I'm used to it can I push and or play with you a little bit please please push so Charlie when you when you say okay that's equally productive right I'm trying to figure out how to say this um what do you think is better for everything to be equally productive or for something to be less productive and that be okay I hear you um perhaps productive is not the right word that they are because I I agree that it is if we if we take productivity to mean what is this adding to uh to your uh ability to influence to your power base to your ability to impact other people's lives in a direct manner to your ability to earn money or whatever to the money that you have at your bank um I still think that there is a tremendous degree of productivity to space that I have underestimated like a lot of my videos I wrote from I read from space so I'm from I'm not disagreeing that there's value to that yeah the reason I'm pushing you is because I think there's there's so still there is a value you are valuing productivity even in a non-traditional way over non-productivity yeah yeah right so so I I think this is where I want to say I've worked and I don't mean to please let me know if I come across as like condescending or Superior no in any way but no no I appreciate it I I I've worked with a I've learned a lot from you um I've worked with a lot of people who are very successful and I I've noticed this thing that they kind of fall into which is like okay like now you've seen the value of space right but at the end of the day are you okay taking space if there's no value um right because if we're really talking about acceptance you should be have no dwesh or repulsion towards wasting your time yeah and yes and there's there's something incredibly liberating which maybe you've already experienced which is like you don't need to be productive all the time it doesn't have to have productivity in a different dimension I I I completely support the journey that you're on but yeah I know I and and I appreciate this no I I I think that you are keyed into something that is not fully germinated in me which is I'm working through this constant need to produce give prove my worth Etc and I'm finding intermediate steps of oh well this counts as productivity you've got to be careful because you'll hijack the Eastern stuff yeah if you know and what you'll do is the the productivity mind will be like oh like if I become an enlightened Transcendent individual imagine how much more productive yeah right so you know it's it's going to be tricky because I I think the the challenge that you face is going to be hard man and yes I've complete I'm excited for your journey I have complete confidence in you and I I think it's gonna be hard to be less it's going to be uh absolutely brutal no it's no one 100 percent uh yes these These are you can call them coping mechanisms to maintain the core of my old belief system whilst rearranging some of the furniture uh and yeah and I the good news is it seems that life in its infinite wisdom is insistent that I learn this at a deeper level because it's not uh it's you know I really am so well taken care of uh this has actually been part of my journey is to really recognize and receive which is hard the gifts of my life that are like I have the gift of having enough money to take a break I have the gift of a supportive group of people around me who care to see me really find acceptance without pushing prodding or controlling and to like uh a lack of deservingness can be activated that I think runs deep uh that well how come and not everybody else gets this and how come just me and it doesn't feel it could feel on right and like I'm not allowed to enter into that space until I donate enough give enough contribute enough which which I you know I don't think there's an end to that yeah beautiful man I I I'm very excited for you and I didn't I didn't mean to poke you too much I mean I I don't I don't appreciate it I'm you know I'm good I think it's gonna You're Gonna Love It On on the other side when you sort of you know you'll realize one day that I I hope and maybe you'll come to a different realization and the realization I have is incorrect I don't think so though because I think you're you're I'm already seeing the seeds but just like you said you've got to be careful because that you know now I know the productivity of space and the value of space that's actually falling into your old trap which is value yeah which is what does does this thing have value does this have value does this have value yes um versus is this thing exactly right yeah and so it's it's seriously something that I think the hardest thing that sometimes I'll try to help people learn I don't know that you can really teach it is that so there's this kind of aspect where everyone's like trying to see the Silver Lining right we're going to practice gratitude and we're gonna like be positive and all this kind of stuff but I I think honestly sometimes the the most tranquil things someone can learn is to actually dispense with all that stuff and to say okay this actually isn't as productive there isn't a w here there's no way to pull a w and it's okay to take the L um and once you're okay taking owls I think there's another layer of the kind of piece that comes with it um yeah but totally totally I I uh I mean it's it's words fail when you get to that I think it's just what the only thing that's inside of me is just I am that that's the only thing that I could that I can add to that yeah so as long as as long as you found that then you're gonna be fine the rest of it is just you just got to give it time to grow and and I I think I've heard so much just amazing self-awareness from you that I I think you've got the stuff unlocked that's gonna work I'm excited to watch your journey thank you thank you um so I I know we've been talking for a little over an hour we've got about half an hour to 45 minutes left so I was wondering what you would prefer um I can ask you more questions we can talk a little bit about men mental health relationships um if you've got questions for me I'm happy to answer them um yeah well maybe doing a follow-up in some way or maybe on your end or something but whatever whatever you want to do good point I was I was gonna say but I'll save that perhaps to my end because I wanted to ask you about ayurveda and uh and to learn from you about um well maybe you could just give me a little bit of how you use that in your interactions or practice and here here I go again with how do you use this no that's fine right so just noticing it is good I mean yeah use it right yeah that's okay I'm I'm curious yeah so let's just do a little bit of background about Irma though so ayurveda's traditional Indian medicine there's a lot of cross-pollination between traditional Chinese medicine and traditional Indian medicine I mean this may be a statement that upsets a lot of people but I think they're very equivalent in a lot of ways just the way that they view the body and the human being is very similar and is very different from the way that we view it in the West so in the west we tend to be very reductionist so what we do is we take a human being and we split them up into their parts and then we kind of dive down and then we split apart into more parts and apart into more parts we sort of have a molecule we have an atom we have uh you know protons and neutrons and electrons and then we have quarks similarly we have a human being we have a brain we have a heart we have a stomach we have gastroenterologists cardiologists neurologists psychiatrists so we're sort of we split the body apart and we focus on a particular organ so the first thing that's different about the eastern systems of medicine is that they are pattern they're about patterns of of people as opposed to individual like organ functions and so what they sort of used were kind of like heuristics or tools of understanding to describe people so what they kind of noticed is that if you look at organ function or you look at any particular thing that there are people who have shared traits across organ systems yeah so for example they noticed that some people get bored very easily they work their hardest so there are some people that if they're doing something new they can work for 12 or 16 hours a day or even 20 hours a day but if they're doing something old it'll be a struggle to work for even four hours a day and they also noticed other patterns like these people for example will be prone to constipation that they will be prone to things like asthma eczema things like that old hands and feet right cold hands and feet yep yeah right so they also will have angular features um other kinds of observations they made or that the the top of their eyelid covers a chunk of the iris of the eye and they made all kinds of interesting observations and so then what they tried to do is try to figure out okay like what are we going to call this right because there are features across eyes skin all the organs and so they used elements and so I don't think that they ever really thought that if I biopsy someone I will find wind but you know Vata is sort of categorized by wind you know what they mean by that is that these people are kind of dynamic like what are the qualities of the wind so this is like stuff that they developed like 4 000 years ago yeah because they didn't have it and I feel I feel a strong connection to wind very like it's when I found out I was about I was like all right that's a little yeah and I have the cold hands cold feet you know I it was surprisingly uh for me yeah and and so if you kind of think about people who are Vata their mind is like the wind so they get excited about things the wind can blow really hard it can stop blowing it can change direction and so the wind sometimes is not quite as consistent um these people also tend to be dry so like they'll have constipation and potentially dry skin and things like that um and so if you kind of look at it scientifically like I was under the impression there was a lot of very good science behind ayurveda um and looked at a couple of Trials and thankfully a couple people in my community pointed out that some of the you know research papers I were talking was talking about were not actually the best so I kind of did a re-evaluation of sort of the scientific basis behind ayurveda there isn't a whole lot of uh good scientific evidence that corroborates this there's some Gene allele studies that detect some statistical significance but it tends to be quite small that even vatas will share particular alleles so if you look at like the way that we metabolize cholesterol for example vatas are more likely to have a particular allele at cholesterol metabolism whereas bit this will have something puffers will have something I think the the more of the data that supports it and there's really not much so some genetic support of some of these theories um frankly it's it's quite light I think part of the problem that we run into with ayurveda and science is that the system of ayurveda is not designed to be studied by Western science correct so so if we look at Western science what we try to do is we assume that a disease is an isolatable thing so what we'll do is these things called randomized controlled trials well we will control for all of the individuality and then we will try to isolate a disease process in some kind of intervention the interesting thing is that runs completely contrary to the principles of ayurveda which is that you can't control for all of these factors because people are individuals um one of the biggest differences I think between Western medicine and Eastern medicine is that Western medicine is generally speaking assumes that all people are the same now a lot of Western doctors will take issue with that but if you really think about I think the more you understand it the more you realize it's true so if you look at these things like fda's recommendation of 2000 calories a day just the fact that we have a recommendation of a uniform number of calories for all human beings speaks to our sort of population-based approach if something works in Western medicine how do we decide if it works we measure 10 000 people and if on average it helps people more than Placebo then we say it works yeah part of what you discover in clinical medicine so if we're talking about like antidepressants and stuff is that really what I've seen is that there are three populations of patients with a mood disorder like major depressive disorder a third of them antidepressants work really really well a third of them you get maybe some benefit and a third of them they really don't work at all and so what we see in Western medicine is we assume that all major depressive disorder all bipolar disorders basically the same we have evidence-based treatments but in ayurveda the fundamental thing that they assume is that people are different so each person has a unique cognitive fingerprint or maybe not unique but there are patterns that we can observe and we sort of see this because we know that some people are like what we call Big boned right where they're going to be their metabolism is going to be heavy set and there's also a concept from Western medicine like endomorphs ectomorphism mesomorphs um Maps really really well so these are kind of independently discovered in the west as well and so what ayurveda basically says is if we look at people who like you know are have high metabolisms they can eat as much as they want to they won't get very fat other at the other end you have these slow metabolism kind of people that are going to be big boned or whatever so we know that metabolically there are like three groups of people what ayurveda basically says is that it's just not metabolically you can look at the mind and there are three groups of people you can look at digestive system um you know skin all of the organ systems have manifestations of these particular things you know in your case is that just sort of like a kind of a scientific disclaimer about you know what do we know what do we not know I think there's also some really interesting scientific stuff around so for example if you look at like Blockbuster drugs like statins which are like cholesterol medication that everyone takes these are actually a medicine that was developed by traditional Chinese medicine so it was used by Chinese doctors the other thing that we tend to see from a science standpoint is that when something in the East works it gets co-opted to the west and we don't really give it credit yeah um and then what we sort of say is oh yeah like Chinese medicine is fake and like Western medicine works but it's like hold on a second who actually discovered this yeah um now going on to so any questions about that just kind of backdrop maybe for us no that's that's that's that's good uh I I appreciate the um the description that you had about reductionist westernist ways again an older version of me would go ha proof positive this is nonsense and I see what you're saying about this is not designed to be measured by a reductionist approach that is looking for alleles even it's supposed like it's supposed to be treated holistically and the question is does this work when broadly like when applied to a person so so I I think just as a from a scientific nerdiness standpoint I think if we want to see ayurveda studies for ayurveda that need to be something called cohort studies as opposed to argentines so we need to do is we need to take 100 people give them ayurvedic treatment and we need to take a hundred people give them Western medical treatment and we need to see when an ayurvedic person diagnoses each person individually and applies whatever recommendations they have does that population how does how do their outcomes compare to the Western medicine doctor and I think if we design studies that way we'll see more value yeah and then and perhaps even just a placebo statement where they're where they're given nothing because I'm sure there are places where even if Western medicine one on average it's it does seem to me you talked about that third for whom depressants don't work there are these people that when they are treated not with the Western interventionists take this pill approach flourish now is that a large number or a smaller number I don't know but there seems to be an important Niche that should exist for people to to have these holistic treatments yeah I mean I I think we're moving in that direction so you know before doing this whole YouTube and twitch thing my area of expertise was actually an evidence-based complement to an alternative medicine so really understanding okay how do we apply this stuff and I I started a clinic actually at Mass General Hospital where I was using some of these principles you know and with appropriate oversight and stuff and we saw really good outcomes and patients really loved it so we filled up pretty quick um I'm kind of going on to you I imagine you're asking because of the vatapeta thing yeah I'm the I mean it started I've uh the psychedelics were way out of my uh that was not something I ever would have considered except that I was extremely sad after a breakup I've seen when handled appropriately tremendous positive impact from those things which made me go what have I written off because it seemed too out there and then a friend said the word ayurveda the other day he told me I was about the Pitta I looked it up and that's that plus what you just shared is sort of the extent of my understanding yeah so in in terms of vatapeta I'm curious whether you're vatapeter pittavata but that's that's because you can have a primary and a secondary so just to you know share with you what my understanding and I'm not a trained ayurvedic physician by the way so this is an amateur hour okay so vatas are tend to be like the wind and fit this tend to be like fire so if you think about the what are the qualities of fire it tends to be it burns right so it's like kind of consistent but it doesn't burn forever so once it runs out of fuel it'll kind of extinguish kind of the more you feed it the more it'll burn so fit this tend to be driven focused um quite like sequential like I'm gonna do this and I'm gonna do this even your personal journey is like very bit oriented it's like yeah I had my shy phase and then I graduated to this and I graduated to this and I graduated to this whereas more of a Vata journey is going to be like then I did this random thing and I did this random thing yours has a lot of linearity to it so if this will be quite linear and then vatas will be kind of all over the place so you really do have a vatapita kind of thing which is and what I what I see when I work with people professionally is you're gonna have a project that you're gonna sync everything into for some amount of time and then you're gonna get bored of it and you need to do something new yeah myself I was studied to become a monk for seven years then I went to med school and did that for a while now I guess I'm doing this starting to get bored of this a little bit we'll see what happens um and so what we sort of see is like a nice amount of variety and I think a big part of understanding your Dosha is that you can kind of craft your life to be optimal for your cognitive fingerprint so one thing you've got to be careful of is that you can get scattered too easily another thing that you've got to be careful of is that you know there are obsessional qualities with Bita um and so vatapetas sometimes have what I would call as like rotating obsessions right so you're not obsessive about one thing you're not going to be like doing violin for 40 years but you're going to get really far into something and then you'll kind of move on to something else and just to understand you know not to let so sometimes you have to be a little bit restrictive in terms of you know is this really time to move on am I sitting in this too long also pittas like need to kind of learn how to let go some and especially when it comes to things like relationships and stuff but those will be quite um tenacious for a lack of a better term avatas can be quite flighty kafas tend to stay in relationships for far too long um but on the upside will also stay in a relationship and work through their problems so these are all more like observational kind of things there's like you know old Indian literature about this but we don't really have good scientific studies but I think observationally it can be quite strong cool yeah I mean the things the things that connected with me and again these are coming from my own personal Reflections that I've had uh there's many things but the cold hands and feet is something that I've had for a long time and again this was in sort of a medicine Journey but uh the codependency thing and how how that sort of connected and why the Vata thing came I had a journey one where wind came up super strong for me but also the sensation of losing connection with my heart and feeling like that was one of the first things that I looked to give away like like it's take this you know and and in the sense of um where to to be liked I I lose connection with self and the a lot of several Journeys therapy all that stuff as I feel connection with my heart and I literally feel my heart beat which sometimes no matter how hard I tried I couldn't I could not locate it without like pressing on it as I do that I literally feel my hands warm up I feel my feet warm up and so some of the things that it pointed to out of balance just in the little quiz that I took I found to be uh oh this this is what it can look like out of balance what if I paid attention to some of these particular things that were highlights as in as as a potential uh problematic symptom when this is out of balance and address that and that that has been a just an interesting thing to pay attention to the last few days yeah it's it's really interesting I was thinking about Mata when you were describing so when I asked you this question earlier about how do you know what's like core personality and how do you know what's performative you basically described grounding so when your energy gets too high and you have too many thoughts yeah that's avata perturbation and then the more that you can literally like get closer to the Earth and it's interesting because the body part that you started with was your buttocks and the gluteal region right so to be seated to be grounded somewhere and and kind of like the more you're in your own head the further away from yourself you become the more grounded you are in your body which I think is really interesting because I'm I have a lot of thoughts I don't know if you've ever heard the phrase normative male alexithymia I'm not so this is this is the other thing that kind of I realized it's really interesting to hear how physical your emotional Journey has been which is oftentimes What Men really need to do um and there's this concept called Alexa thymia which is color blindness of your internal emotional state so a lot of men like literally don't know what emotions they're feeling what they're feeling yeah yeah so we're familiar with frustration and everything pisses us off like if I'm ashamed of myself I'm pissed off if I'm yeah if I feel rejected by someone unloved I'm gonna be pissed at them you know I'll be pissed at myself I'm not depressed I'm gonna be pissed at myself yep yep um you know if I'm anxious about something I'm gonna lash out at that person and try to be like controlling towards them and and try to control my own life and so one of the really interesting things is that there's a term normative male alexithymia and what some psychologists have discovered is that it's normal for men to not understand their internal emotional state yeah and so for a lot of men what we do understand is like the feelings in our body so the the window to understanding your emotions as a man is oftentimes actually using your body yes so understanding what am I feeling physically right now then you can ask people like okay if you've got a lump in your throat like what emotion do you think that could be and then they're like I don't know maybe fear and that's like that argue you're feeling afraid they're like wow yeah I'm feeling afraid like I feel like like that's fear oh crap I never knew that um so it makes a lot of I mean just everything that I'm hearing from you is is making me you know it's really lovely to hear kind of your journey and using your body to understand your emotions and how your EQ has essentially been boosted yes no I I what you just said 100 I mean first off I I discovered the ground probably six months ago it was a revelation like it was life-changing uh to go holy cow and and but for me it's the support of the ground which I just didn't notice uh it what a blessing and gift it is to feel the ground uh and I've lost it for a long time the other thing the um I can't say it back to you but the male the male inner color blindness uh totally relate to that I again shame is something that I I didn't know that I had any shame probably up until six months to a year ago what I knew that I had was anger I had and I would feel my fist and I had come to oh this isn't always anger sometimes this is trying to crawl out of my own skin because I feel so uncomfortable with myself and in yes like the the higher gradation of understanding of these experiences implies of radically different approach you know the way the way that one handles anger and the way that one handles shame uh for me at least I'll say uh it that was such a difficult learning but again Another Blessing gift to go oh my God this is shame that's what this is uh and that's why when somebody talks about it I feel angry at them no I'm I'm ashamed I'm not angry at you for bringing this up necessarily though that can be activated I'm feeling shame and I want tenderness versus you know I would feel shame get angry get away from me was was the reaction so often so it's been uh yeah the body has been that place where I have found the ability to separate out what is actually occurring inside of me yeah cool man yeah yeah love the ground my guy um yeah you know it's interesting I I don't know if I'd quite call this a meditation technique but I was uh working in a psychiatric hospital and and one day people were ungrounded so I did something that maybe could have gotten re-fired who knows I think it was probably safe but so when I asked all my patients we all went outside so there's a group of about 10 of us and what I asked the patients to do is just spin in the circle we're going to spin around like a kid until you feel dizzy and the second you feel dizzy laid on down on the ground so hyper activate your vestibular system and then like if you want to feel the ground and you want to know what it is to be grounded this is such a beautiful technique because then you're going to feel the whole world spinning around you but there's one place of solidity and you'll feel it on your back such an amazing sensation wow and I think we sort of know in Psychiatry that for people who are not in a good mental head space we tend to use grounding meditations basically when we teach mindfulness on the inpatient unit it's almost always a grounding kind of meditation yeah that's super cool I like that the uh for I I think the way I found the ground was not dissimilar which is I had to through uh you know for me with psychedelics but I don't think it has to be for anyone the structure that I had built in myself had to get broken down so that I could hit the ground so I could relax into the ground and same thing that you're describing with the dizziness is I'm gonna I'm gonna mess up your vestibular system for a moment so that you can feel what is solid even when you're spinning and feeling and falling apart super cool what a beautiful way to put it so yeah you can feel you know when everything is spinning you can feel yeah that's awesome yeah so what what are you how are you feeling about the conversation is there something in particular we want to talk about is that enough about ayurveda oh I I will definitely ask you more if you uh would love to love to have you on our cast um but no that's that's a really good understanding for me and I'm happy to go I've got time we can go in any direction or whatever if it's time to wrap up I'm also cool with that um so I'm a little bit curious like do you have thoughts about what's going on with men nowadays yeah let's do it male Mental Health you know when you described men I think you're dead on like what is normal for men is to not know their inner World um I feel like it's with the word that I've recently learned and appreciated is subclinical which is to say we have a culture it has made normal illness so I'm not sure that what is happening with men today is necessary to occur inside of men but I think yeah in our culture it seems to um I could I'll speak to my cohort which I think is a little bit different perhaps than people that that you might often speak to there's um and forgive me if I'm wrong but I know that you talk a lot about dopamine and and getting uh you know addicted to screens and the uh inability to sit with boredom because you're just your brain still like get me some more of that stuff and how many ways there are for that outlet um what I've seen in my cohort of men is men that you know shunned that found a way to cut that off optimize that and then leaned heavy into performance which is perhaps just another dopamine trap um but what I see in them which is really beautiful now that it's shifting is that they have uh they're disconnected from femininity and my cohort the way that we've dealt with that is by going heavy into relationships and that was like the one Bastion and our lives where they where I and my friends were able to relax and not produce not work sit back and watch a movie because it's a date night and that's acceptable on a date night and what has shifted amongst my friends is that I feel like perhaps it's aspects of mature masculinity perhaps it's a more feminine aspect in ourselves but we have been able to provide one another as friends with space listening to one another's problems without jumping in with advice judgment or shame in order like that's not how we do it here time to like turn it around and change it um and what I have seen from my friends and myself is that we're sort of a cohort of kids that were had super enmeshed mothers like that's all of my friends and uh as as because of that we take massive levels of responsibility we feel everything um in in both the you know in a way that is beneficial and detrimental is our fault so we're constantly taking responsibility and we can overstep uh we can allow that to make relationships toxic because the question is what did I do wrong she said I did something wrong I need to adjust I'm not doing enough and as we are more there for one another um some relationships are ending with girlfriends some relationships are transforming and uh there's there's more sincere and open expressed love which I would say I think that's a broad thing probably across our society that men have had to settle for respect as the highest thing to Aspire to and do not have a lot of experiences of Love of like you don't have to earn you don't have to earn it you just you are and that's enough for you to be sort of what you pointed me towards um that's that's my broad sense for my little my little corner of people that I that I interact with yeah it's it's um really interesting to hear I I think uh can I just process what you said for a second please please I I wonder yeah let me just can I think for a second yeah yeah calculating your time how common do you think it is for people to be enmeshed with their moms okay so my sample size is totally messed up because I'm not sure yeah I mean so that's what I'm kind of wondering is I'm wondering actually like maybe the assumpt the mistake we're making is that we're assuming that your sample size is very specific to you oh well perhaps I you know and okay I'll I'll be so bold as to make a generational claim that I've seen for me and if this reflects the people you've talked to um my grandpa was an orphan who fought in World War II I mean that guy God bless him had a hard material physical existence he had 10 kids that he provided for materially and I don't think was an emotional presence for either his wife or his kids his daughter my mom and you know my dad of the same generation what they provided for their children was uh in my Suburban town which I felt was very common was you're going to be well taken care of materially and we're involved emotionally for like very much there when I see my mom though the thing that was being processed I feel like for her even as she had kids was this I never felt like I had that emotional deep connection that I wanted with my family let's do it now we're gonna be tight and um pendulum swung the other way yes and so my generation and the people that I see around me um they described them about the best mom in the world she was always there it's a lot of it's a lot of those things and I think what took me a while to acknowledge was not the wrongness of it first I acknowledged the wrongness because I was angry but the pain that was the enmeshed unit that we became from a very very young age and did not fully individuate and the way that I handled that was I mean I told you I left the country I want to like I tried to get far away from that but couldn't it was that was like my system was so comfortable with that sort of a setup um and the you know the gift of having had both the physical support and a lot of emotional love as well which came with some enmeshment things is that I feel the opportunity in my generation to make a different mistake when I have kids which I had I don't know what that mistake will be but I feel that I before I have kids uh that I have the opportunity to do a lot of healing and a lot of okayness with myself such that my kid is offered the opportunity at least for me to just be to just you know to be who you are you do not have to tend to my emotional needs I had I chose to have you my job is to provide the love this is an asymmetrical relationship and I'm totally down for that um and of course there will be things that I that I receive and get from that relationship but I think it's more in the vein of the joy of watching you be you is the gift that I'll get um and of course I'll make mistakes and do things wrong yeah but yeah so that's I don't know if that generational lineup is is what you see when you talk to people but that's certainly big in my group yeah I mean I I think that's that's what's so interesting is because I also think about being enmeshed with a mom is a a not normal thing but the more that I'm sort of hearing you talk about it and just the the subjective the subjective way that you describe it I think is actually sounds quite common to me yeah and especially as you're bringing in these generational aspects right so we had like the generation of World War II vet veterans who were emotionally unavailable focused on material things provided for their families right because that's what the major responsibility and then the generation above us we're new to these emotion things and so maybe they got too emotionally involved and it's it's really interesting because I I'm not hearing anywhere that you had a bad mom you know no she was this is I mean this is what people I'm so thank you so much for reminding me and saying that but people can sometimes think when I say this that I had a bet she was wonderful yeah and and yes and there was pain and there was there was this thing yeah and and it's it's it you know I I certainly that's why I sort of mentioned explicitly because I'm not you know I'm hearing that you had a very loving mother Who provided for you and and took care of you and and things like that but as you're kind of saying I I think that there is I wonder if there is something you know because something's going on with men yeah I'm not quite sure what it is I I certainly see responsibility as a big part of it like I've had patients who were making seven figures and are suicidal this is another really interesting statistic potentially up to 60 of men who kill themselves may not actually have any mental illness there's some really fascinating studies on that where we're not quite sure but I think one of the trickiest things we understand is or we're starting to understand and I'm really appreciating as a clinician is that suicidality doesn't necessarily equate to mental illness yet especially with the men that I work with a lot of them it's not like their mind is malfunctioning so when we think about mental illness we think about pathology this is not the way that it's supposed to function and for a really long time I think we just assumed and we sort of still do we sort of take suicidality as a mark for and I definitely think it warrants like a clinical evaluation because if there is an illness that can be medically treated like we don't want to miss that by any means but the really disturbing thing is that some of the people that I've worked with I wouldn't really they don't fit the standard profile of something like a mood disorder yeah instead what I see is a lot of overwhelming responsibility an attempt to live up to that responsibility and inevitable failure because the responsibility is inappropriate and it's in many ways it's similar to what you're describing but go ahead no that I mean I'm not as familiar with the broad patterns but when you do say that that that matches very much my subjective experience um which is I think it's possible that there is a generation and certainly in my neighborhood there was of mothers that wanted to heal through having children when I hear you know they wanted that that was their their connection point with the world was to have that child as opposed to having a connection point with themselves and then I'll speak only you know to my own limited family there's also the element that I haven't mentioned of the inability to acknowledge like there's a shame in acknowledging daddy issues if you're a man or mommy issues if you're a man because you know those those terms in themselves can feel derogatory to meaning or childlike but my relationship with my dad had a massive impact on who I became the wonderful things and the negative things are the negative things the the things and one element of that was feeling as if I contributed to like when I saw him uh working to provide for his family that I had made his life worse when I saw his frustrations and holding that he'd be better off without me and I and you know people had different levels of um emotional fluency with their dads for me mom was the I love you the hugs and all of that my dad was catch in sports and he was present but um the tenderness like there was not that that level of tenderness had to dip by age three four five I don't know when where we couldn't do the hugs anymore and we couldn't do the the sincere depth of I love yous like that that that was inappropriate and as I look back it was like recently I've gotten some of them I've uh through some of the work we've done together like the hugs that he has given me have transformed my life and I'm not I cannot exaggerate the the I could have done it without it and it would have taken me a while but oh my God receiving some of that and going he loves me I have been a gift to him what a what a like earth-shattering for me to let that to let that um in and I know that everybody has their own different family configuration of which that may or may not be true for them but the I'm I don't want to reduce everything to the mother wound and the father wound but that has been a real access point for me to become more Soulful more whole and to um not fall into the categories that you are describing that men are falling into of you know self-harm and all those sorts of things it's so interesting because so many of the things that you're saying can lead to some of the people that I've worked with you know when you kind of say that to realize that I'm a burden like that's the first step on a path that can end in a very dark place yeah I think the other thing that I'm I'm sort of appreciating is just how touch starves so Society is a whole this is not exclusively meant by any means I think we're becoming a society where women are also increasingly touch starved yeah um and but men I I think I I know so many men who like you said like we don't it's kind of weird but I almost sort of talked this up to the the general homophobia of the 80s and 90s right where I also grew up in a place where gay was a derogatory term like I grew up in East Texas and and to be gay was the biggest insult that you could possibly have and there was just a complete lack of acceptance and the other really interesting thing that I kind of notice when I think about my own life is that it was because of that homophobia that my friends and I were not allowed to touch each other yeah right like we couldn't hug or we couldn't do any of that stuff and if you kind of look at you know the way we're wired I mean we're wired to touch if you look at like Aboriginal societies and stuff like that I remember there was I was in India and and this is my first summer in India and there was one of my friends or mentors was getting married so I was like 21 at the time he was like 28 or something and he had two of his friends like come up to him and they like flanked him on each arm so he had one arm around each of their shoulders and they were like both rubbing his belly and they were like like cooing at him I don't know what else to call it and and you know my East Texas mind was like what is this you know and they were like joking with him about oh you know you're gonna get married now and they were talking about how he's gonna like eat well or something like that and just that level of touch was just absolutely foreign yeah and and like you know friends in India like men will hold hands when they like walk which is a little bit unusual right so like or at least to me it was yeah and so I think that there's there's a big lack of you're talking about the healing power of just like hugging your dad and yeah and like you know I wonder if that's a huge part of it like just I I think it is and also like the the level of disconnection for me from my body that would have let me know hey this is something I want like I couldn't even feel the lack of that uh it's we only are aware of these problems because seven steps down the line somebody does something dramatic hurts themselves but there's also I mean even the men that you're describing don't have mental illness there's an entire I know them of successful High producing leaders that are uh trying to medicate the internal world with external success and they're not addicted to drugs in the traditional sense but they are they are addicted to that cycle that uh for me it cannot be tended to in that way at least that's what I have come to learn and uh I think it's probably true for them as well but yeah there's the the other ways in we're not even aware of yeah I think that's well said and I think the unfortunate thing that I've found and there's some Eastern teachings to support this is that I think you have to kind of go through that to recognize its insufficiency so oftentimes when I when I work with people in general I mean we're talking about men right in the second but I think it applies to women as well where you know you can't know that something is not going to make you happy until you actually have it and there's a really interesting kind of uh conundrum in in the east as if you look at all the people who attained Enlightenment I'm not sure if you're kind of familiar with this concept of like you know Buddha became enlightened yeah um so if you look at all the people who basically are like the religious figures and if we kind of look at it from a historical perspective these pop people were probably enlightened and the really interesting thing is in in India you know you have four castes and the highest casts were the brahmins or the priest cast and they were the closest to God they were the teachers of meditation but there are no enlightened brahmanas all of the enlightened people were actually from the noble cast so Buddha was a king or Prince um you know like the RAM and Krishna which are considered avatars of Vishnu or also Kings or princes and so it's really interesting because you would think that shouldn't the priests be the ones that are enlightened because they're the ones that are teaching meditation and there's a really simple kind of take on this which is that you can't really move towards spirituality Until you realize that material Pursuits are unsatisfying yeah and so just talking about you know the journey that you're on like it's like I don't mean to demean your experience but it's lovely to see how you're on this journey and it's kind of textbook of like material success and then kind of like finding yourself and then like you know and and once again I really don't mean to demean it because I honestly not at all but Jim Carrey has that commencement or acceptance speech he's talking to I think college grads where he says you know I hope you get everything that you dream of so that you can realize that that's not the answer and yeah I am so grateful to have been able to get those markers early in my life and uh what yeah gosh so grateful to have done that and I and I wish people the success that they imagine as long as they're not hurting other people partially for that reason it's like I hope you get it and then you go oh is this it you know is is this did this do the thing that I thought it would do um but you had said something about men one thing that I just wanted to to mention somebody brought this up to me and I thought that it was poignant was that with the exception of perhaps handshakes and the occasional bro hug a lot of the uh touches that men receive from other men are violent and meaning like you know if you're touched you might perhaps it's spanked or it's a it's a knock on your arm or uh you know God forbid you're molested or something like that and it's I have felt and this is something I had to unlock that there was a protectiveness in me not extending myself towards other men there was I don't want to let that like again a not knowing who I was confused maybe I'm that that person and at times I think I could have let that out with rage and uh so that there's there's uh self there's there's another protectedness which is I'm not going to do that to you let me stay in my own private island of not touching and not acknowledge that this is something that I wish that I had in a safer way yeah it's it's interesting I mean I I think that mirrors a lot of my own experience when I started dating um you know early on my girlfriend described what I had as a bubble and she was like any time I get inside the bubble like you recoil and she was very intentional about like bursting my bubble it made me really uncomfortable at the time I mean I'm glad that she did it now but um you know it's it's so interesting to think about I had not quite thought about it that way but even in my own life how like like touch was like alien to me like physical touch until I started dating and then yeah it became normal more normal yeah for me I mean part of part of it and I'm working through it still um to recognize again because I I have the tendency to beat myself up for the ways in which I fall short of uh perfect loving person um but to recognize for me the confused love that came from I'm not going to touch you I am not going to argue I'm not going to place my hand on you because some part of me is fears harm uh coming through me to you even though it's not rationally connected there's an emotional there's an emotional hook in me especially with the uh the people that I'm closest to it's like I can hug strangers but the people that I'm closest to need to be taken they need to be more protected than than a stranger does I love this phrase confused love because I I Can Only Imagine you know how does like an eight-year-old or ten-year-old like understand that instinctively there should be some kind of physical contact in a moment like this but that I'm not getting that yeah and and even on a subtle level I wonder how at a minimum confusing it is and at the top and traumatic it is yeah and even just hearing your own story we we did a stream on trauma where you know one of the biggest things that I've learned about trauma is in my opinion it's like the great chameleon so it looks like all kinds of things yeah and it manifests in so many different ways it can look like ADHD it can look like depression like chronic depression it can look like even an endless Pursuit for success um you know it can look like so many different things and so yes the story is anyway go ahead oh I I you just said endless chameleon I'm like yeah that's that resonates uh gosh it's and it's also for me has been um I think of it you know there's all these it's got tendrils and it's like oh this one thing affects it affects if I hug my brother or not it affects uh the relationship I mean we don't need to I know we're late in the Stream I don't need to get into the particulars at this point but it has had wide-ranging the various traumas of my life have had wide-ranging effects in places that I would never guess and I'm just very glad to have well maybe that's not the right word oh it's just nice to reconstitute myself as well yeah it's just no I go it's really nice yeah absolutely man because I think you know you mentioned earlier that it kind of effect it affects your sense of self which is really what trauma does yeah and and thereby it manifests because then what happens is we carry it with us and it touches all these other parts of your life and even some of that hunger to be good right you can't have that hunger of being good unless you feel like you're not good yeah and one of the simplest ways and there's a lot of really fascinating science and even like theory of mind so if we look at young children they don't have well-developed theory of mind so what that sort of means is that they don't understand that there are other conscious beings that can affect things and so if I don't have an understanding a cognitive development that other Minds exist out there if I get hurt it's my fault and that's actually like evolutionary so if you're like if you're a one-year-old child who's learning how to walk and you feel pain you have to accept responsibility otherwise you'll never learn how to walk because if you blame someone else every time you fall over like you're never going to learn how to walk and so we have some of this evolutionary circuitry but the downside of that the price we pay is that if something traumatic happens to us it's my fault and that's where you know the subjective experience of that is shame but it's so much it's more deeply wired than that yeah and that for me the illusion of control I mean what you're describing is you know the the protective illusion of control that we can adopt at times in order to cope with with difficult experiences is just you know gotten blown out of proportion uh certainly in my life and go ahead yeah yeah I was just going to say I think that that illusion of control just like you were kind of saying like everything you're describing I think sort of I'm not trying to diagnose you or anything but it's it's like consistent with what I've seen and I think these are not even you mentioned subclinical earlier these are not necessarily even diagnosable things this is just how human beings are where you know if you were in a situation where you were made to feel bad and someone else took power over you and you know if other people if what you feel is dependent on other people I think you connected these dots yourself then if I can control the other person I can control the way that I feel and so the way to control my feelings which first of all by the way you can't accept them right you got to control them you got to make them go away gotta have the good ones you gotta have the pride you got to have the appreciation you got to have the you know and you can't have the bad ones is by controlling other people's behavior and so we see that too that control freaks can sometimes that can be a trauma response yeah and and for me it was while not acknowledging that this was me self-medicating through other people it was all I'm just so worried about them I'm so you know I just need them and what do you need them to be better for them and and not recognizing oh for them for me it was was a huge piece as well yeah I've never so Charlie seriously I'm loving so much of the way that you use language self-medicating with other people is a phrase that I've never heard before I don't know if that's is that used elsewhere I I don't know I don't know it's brilliant bro like thank you I had not read it I'll take credit on the stream but then I'll give it a Google I mean I'm sure someone else has said it somewhere but but just the way that you articulate stuff I think really captures things oh thank you thank you I I can see why your you know YouTube channel is so freaking successful because with the way that you use words is really amazing dude really I think you've got a gift with words it translating Human Experience thank you it has been a real that that was a huge and I know again I know we're already down uh the gift of Charisma on command was to take something that felt there's something deep in there which is I want to share my experience and be understood and that has taught me to use language in a way such that I get a response or resonance and it's really not the I I've had to learn it's not the only way but it is a powerful way to be with someone to be understood to be connected and though not the only way I have learned the value of sitting in Silence with someone and I've learned things about myself and other people that I have would have never been able to communicate uh or or feel in any other way so it's uh blessings and curses often are are the same exact thing yeah I think that's you've stumbled upon a principle called advait vedanta which is non-dualism which is that there's no such thing as a blessing or a curse that everything is just you know what it is yeah well I'll have to ask you on on uh when we have a conversation for me but I I'm so curious about your seven years as a monk we can we can table that for now but I'm still interested no I think the the sentiment that you just shared is actually a great place to wrap up just about you know how life is a series of blessings and curses um so thank you very much for you know coming on stream today do you want to just tell people so where should we find you now should we yeah I mean Charisma on command or you want to point us there's a lot of things sales videos coming out I'm not making them but you can check out Charisma on command if you'd liked it before I hope you continue to uh I have a podcast called dropping in we'll hopefully have you on sometime soon and you just have been dropping in podcasts and those are yeah it's all YouTube is what I do these days okay awesome man and um what about your didn't you have one oh your DND thing D don't thank you for not letting me forget yeah it's called Uh improv and Dragons uh and it's got four episodes that are out right now put give it a look if you're not a DNB person give it give it five minutes see if it if it's up your alley I put a tremendous amount of uh heart and effort I'm a novice in it and uh I'm very excited to continue that storytelling hopefully in five plus years you'll see uh all of the lessons that I'm learning at this first one which I recognize is uh in some ways leave something to be desired but still has still has the heart in there will be uh borne out to a beautiful like everything ties together uh story in five years so if you want to check out the early days of that it's at improving dragons wow dude that's awesome so improving dragons dropping in is your podcast and Charisma on command and thank you so much for coming Charlie yeah thank you for having me I wish you all the best on your sharp left turn in your career I think it's gonna be great and if I can leave you with one last thing um if it's if it's okay if I give you just a tiny bit of advice is that acceptable so one thing I would just strongly recommend is you don't need to be ready to have kids I know it sounds weird I I hear this too much where uh you know and this may not be true of everyone like if you're not ready to have kids don't have kids but there are some people who are like I need to be perfect before I have kids and you need to sort out all this emotional stuff so that you can appreciate like honestly my biggest learning from having children is that they teach you you try to prepare so much but they teach you so well and and you don't need to be ready for I mean they'll make you ready that's what they do yeah and and so you know I'd encourage you if the time feels right and if you know you're with the right person or not with the right person or whatever you decide to do with your life but but you're great dude like you're gonna be a fantastic dad like I I uh I feel really strongly about that so that's the one thing I would leave you with thank you you're good I hear that you'll be fine it'll be fine and and I'll have times if not fine and that will be okay as well yeah absolutely so I appreciate that yeah take care man thank you so much for coming today thank you so much all right do I click off here how do we do the the stream thing I'm gonna click a button and then I'ma hang up on you okay sounds good okay well that was fun chat so cool oh my God okay so I was taking Furious notes and I feel inspired to make like a dozen YouTube videos out of this so there's so many Concepts that Charlie just has such good language like his experience his journey like it's the whole package chat he is he is a mega Chad he's a sigma grind set alpha male all of those things and now he's getting in touch with his feminine side which is the most Alpha thing you can do and you know there's the pursuing success like also kind of bizarre that there's like a history of trauma and like all the success and it's like not enough and there's a little bit of psychedelics thrown in I feel like he is an encapsulation of all of the stages of our community because we have everyone right and he's kind of like all of them so I hope you all enjoyed it I hope you all learned something I'm truly just stunned and and it really makes me appreciate how much we can learn from people who are not experts right so I think one of the biggest things that we're we're almost missing in well I guess we're not really missing it because of social media and whatnot but what I think is so cool is just hearing him talk about his journey and like how trauma is like a part of it and has defined many things but also like is a part of his journey and how he's grown out of it I think you know a couple of takeaways so a couple things to remember one is that psychedelics you have to be super careful right we don't recommend them for a reason um we hear success stories the problem is that how can I say this the people who become successful YouTubers and have a lot of self-actualization and direction in life are the ones who had good experiences the people who have bad experiences you will never hear about I mean you'll hear about them potentially from our community because we talk to everybody but you know so you've got to be super careful about a selection bias there um but a couple of other things that I think he's just a walking advertisement for I think one amount of like understanding your body getting some therapy having a strong support network we saw some animals in the background and I think like hugging your dad right or like like engaging in some sort of you know meaningful physical contact with like other human beings and I think so many Concepts that I think are really interesting to think about just about how men relate to their emotions and by the way this is not exclusively men anymore so I suspect that in the next 20 years we're going to see a lot of the problems that men face today women are going to be facing them too it's already starting to happen so loneliness touch starvation there are some ideas that women can find companionship or love like whenever they want to it's not really true I think we've seen that in our community and huge amount of gratitude to all the women who have spoken up in our community and shared their experiences it's not necessarily easy to be a woman in this world it's not necessarily easy to be a man and and I think really about sort of understanding your emotions the role of your emotions not retreating for your emotions there's just a lot of good stuff in there because especially what we see is that when see when you can't sit with your emotions you end up out of control in your life because you don't control what you feel you just control what you do when you feel something and so if my whole life is lived in reaction to my emotions other people get to control me because if they can evoke an emotion they get to control my behavior and this is what we feel like sometimes right so you get into these relationships these toxic relationships parents significant others friends where they make you feel a particular way and they manipulate you they're emotionally manipulative but someone can only be emotionally manipulative if an emotion within you leads to a behavior as long as that link is there you can be emotionally manipulated but the moment you are able to be with an emotion and not react to it is the moment that you will be free of all emotional manipulation and this too what do we do when people are emotionally manipulative we try to control them we try to control the circumstances right we try to put ourselves in situations where they can't manipulate us but instead we should be controlling this so I'm trying to prevent this person from being emotional I'm not going to answer the phone because when Mom or Dad call they're gonna guilt-trip me into going home I don't want to go home so I'm going to avoid them right and if even if you think about that that's emotionally reactive I'm afraid of them so I'm gonna not answer the phone and then what do mom or dad do or whoever they find some way to get to me they call the cousins they message me here they show up on my doorstep and then they make me feel guilty for not answering the phone don't you love us and we've done everything for you and so like you're responding to your emotions responding your emotions responding to your emotions you want freedom from all that learn to sit with your emotions and people say that's hard you're right it is difficult it is very difficult it is doubly difficult because we specifically avoid and ignore training that skill when we're growing up stop crying or you are crying here let me give you a toy let me make the crying stop let me use something from the outside like an iPad or a phone or a screen nowadays let me use one of these devices to take your emotions away maybe you use a device to take your emotions away having a bad day let's binge watch something and so you lose control over yourself and if you don't control yourself other people can control you it's that simple so if you want to get out of this if you don't know where to start you're like my emotions are too much start with your body start with the physical sensations of an emotion that you feel and just sit with those right so if you feel some kind of emotion just sit down close your eyes lay down on the ground go for a walk and pay attention to what you're feeling describe as many things that you can that you're feeling and as you notice each and every one of those things you will notice that sometimes with increased awareness there is an increased intensity but this is where there's a really interesting principle of Neuroscience that rotating the awareness through your body reduces the impact of the negative sensation so this is kind of weird I'm going to go I'll explain this maybe in a little bit more detail so there's a study there's studies done on people with chronic pain okay you guys want like a mini lecture like we're gonna okay so let's understand that people don't understand how pain works so we're going to talk about this so in our brain we have this thing called the somatosensory cortex and in the somatos sensory cortex we have something called the homunculus do you guys know what this is so I'm going to try to pull up oh man okay here we go the cortical homunculus okay you all see this so this thing is the cortical homunculus so in the part of our brain where we feel Sensations we have a map of our brain so if I touch someone let's say over here or sorry if I touch someone on their hip let's say this part of their brain lines up and so what you'll kind of see is that some parts of the brain are big in some parts I mean some parts of the body are big and some are small so if you look at the hand why is the hand so big it's because literally more of our brain is focused on the hands so that's why we can touch things very finely here whereas if you look at things like the back there's less of our brain is devoted to that so the bigger the part on the homunculus is the more sensitive we are to touch so researchers were looking at chronic pain okay and we had this map of our body in our brain that's where our somatosensory cortexes that we feel touch and so what they noticed or a couple things the first is that the homunculus is not fixed that a particular part of the more of our brain can be focused on one part of our body and that the funkules actually rotates around so our whole Savannah sensory cortex is not can be locked into one area so if for example I'm getting a massage and someone is rubbing my shoulders the majority of my somatosensory cortex will be tuned into the shoulders it's actually a lot more fluid than the homunculus would suggest so that's actually an incorrect representation there's fluidity in our somatosensory cortex what does this mean for pain so what we found in people who have chronic pain is that they're homunculus is not fluid there is a part of their brain that is locked in to a particular part of their body that is the party that has that part that is the part part of the body that has pain and now so what we thought was that since someone is hurting more of their brain is focusing on the pain but it's actually a two-way street it's because the brain is locked into the area where the chronic pain exists that exacerbates the pain if you all want to understand this very simply if you're getting an injection if you're distracted by something the injection will hurt less if you are primed to the injection like getting a blood draw or you know getting a shot then it will hurt more what we pay attention to is what hurts so how do you fix chronic pain really fascinating you rotate the awareness throughout the body so as you focus on a different part the pain actually goes down and once you do rotating awareness of the body like through a body scan in meditation then what happens is it frees up the homunculus and it's no longer locked into the painful part fascinating okay so this research you guys can look up the the lab so there was a someone named Dr Kerr at Harvard Medical School who was a specialist in this kind of stuff did somata sensory research and she had a very young research assistant at the time you may find a publication for current This research assistant so this is what's interesting when it comes to understanding your emotions if you say my emotions are intolerable and focusing on that part of my body will only make the emotions worse this is why we are going to use rotating awareness of the body and if you notice one sensation and then notice the next and notice the next and notice the next all of them will decrease and you will be able to tolerate the motion if you can tolerate the emotion and you can cause it to kind of melt away then you will not react to it and you will not be controlled by it simple hard to do takes practice but simple tons of Neuroscience to support it questions will this work if I get stabbed what a fascinating question the answer is probably to some extent right so we know that Adept meditators can actually resist painful stimuli this there's there have been studies on I wouldn't you know I think if you got to do something go for it but you know that's not an experiment that anybody should be running um is it possible to sit with our for our emotions for too long I'm going to go ahead and say no so let me explain what I mean sitting with your emotions for too long is probably not going to happen what oftentimes happens the too long part comes from not sitting with our emotion but engaging with our emotion so when we engage with our emotion we give it life we give it strength we give it energy so if I'm feeling bad about myself and I got dumped by my ex and I'm feeling a particular way and then I go stalk my ex on social media I'm engaging with the emotion in each picture I see of my ex out there having fun maybe dating other people is are they dating are they not dating I see pictures of her with someone else that's engaging with our emotion it's not sitting with it and so if we engage it it gets energy and you all may have seen this where you can engage with your anxiety you can try to fix your anxiety right you can feed it let me run through all the permutations and so you go on working with it working with it you even try to conquer it you try to suppress it you try to push it away and it comes roaring back the second you let down the Walls so if people sort of think okay can I sit too long with my emotions no you can engage with them and the more you engage with them the stronger they'll become but sitting with them generally speaking decreases it now some people may say but I've sat with my emotions for a long time and it doesn't work to which I would say okay first of all I'm sure that there's a portion of the population that that may be true for but I'd say that even in my experience I don't think you you're sitting with it correctly but you've got to be careful about right because there's a side note that we've got to be really careful about if we say hey something doesn't work for you you need to try harder that's a very dangerous thing because ha you know it's an infallible hypothesis if you're not trying hard enough then it could you know it's kind of like when I talk to some people some people will you know pick something like let's say prayer nothing against Prayer by the way but people will be like yeah you know the reason these are problems are happening is because you're not praying hard enough it's like that's an unfalsifiable hypothesis at the same time I've worked with a ton of people who've been depressed for a very long time and they've tried sitting with their depression and usually what happens if they're sitting with their depression for a long time it doesn't work is that the depression is a cover for something else so what they really need to be sitting with is underneath the depression I've tried sitting with anger but it never works that's because you have to sit with what's fueling underneath and in the case of depression what is it it's self-loathing it's anger it's hatred it's shame it's not sadness why are you so sad because my life is going nowhere because I got the short end of the stick well what's the emotion underneath that you're pissed at someone else for giving you the short end of the stick or you're pissed at yourself for being given an opportunity and not taking it that's what leads to chronic depression in terms of anger I'm angry angry angry what's underneath the anger shame I'm ashamed of myself I feel unloved I'm afraid I'm unlovable and so I'm going to get angry at the opposite gender or maybe even my own gender if I'm gay I will hate this class of people because something I'm afraid that they don't they won't accept me or they've rejected me and now I feel like I'm rejectable and so if I lack that self-love I'm gonna blame someone else so generally speaking I think that sitting with an emotion works caveats generally speaking it works so glenton is saying I can't feel the emotion that anger masks though that's also common that's why sometimes it helps to have some help right so this is where like doing practices so if you can't feel it that's because oftentimes we're colorblind we're alexathymic and the cool thing is that we can like do things to increase our awareness of thing things in the same way that you can train your palate to detect certain flavors you can train your sense of touch you can train your ears so when we're practicing auscultation in medicine like the first time I listen to someone's heart I couldn't tell what I was hearing he listened to ten hearts a hundred hearts a thousand Hearts ten thousand hearts I probably listen to somewhere around 5000 or so I would guess then you'll be able to detect a lot of differences so if you can't detect your emotions that's why we have some of these things like community events like right in the fields certain kinds of meditations things like that right you can even journal or do other kinds of things okay so the voice is going out I want to thank all y'all for coming today um really appreciate I know we're at a different time and especially our EU gang it's probably super late for y'all but uh really loved having Charlie on and um really loved his perspective so stay tuned to the stuff that we're doing during mental health May we're doing all of these things to help y'all and we're all about raising awareness but we're also about doing more than raising awareness because awareness don't cut it so we have a lot of different stuff hopefully things that are a little bit more applicable to y'all that will help you in some concrete way that's what we're really focused on and the reason that we have these kinds of conversations is to raise awareness but hopefully I'll learn something from this you learn something you take away something from our addiction stream you take away something from our trauma stream you understand that trauma is now a chameleon and that maybe you're not screwed up and you don't you're not a waste of space maybe there's a part of you that feels that way because you were taught that about yourself because someone else made you feel that way but that doesn't mean it's true for you and so our hope is that by elevating not just awareness of mental health but awareness of yourself that we're able to help you and as always stay tuned to our twitch YouTube whatever Twitter um and even if you all you know if you guys haven't checked out things like Dr K's guide or coaching feel free to check them out that's where we have more comprehensive resources that are like we answer all the questions um because if y'all have Bunches of questions about things like ADHD motivation meditation depression anxiety understanding yourself understanding your identity that's all in Dr K's guide check out coaching if y'all are looking for one-on-one support or group support we see a lot of benefits for people who actually it's interesting because a lot of this Charisma on command stuff is like stuff we kind of practice not those specifics but we practice a lot of emotional awareness awareness of yourself how to interact with other people how to listen that's part of the those are the tools of group coaching so then we tackle particular problems using those tools but you have to learn emotional awareness how to listen to yourself other people will be listening to you they'll learn how to ask you questions so that you can gain understanding of yourself that all happens in groups so definitely check that out and if y'all are not interested in that stuff or whatever but you still appreciate what we do please just share what we do with other people so that helps us too so you know if you guys donate and stuff that's cool but if y'all can't afford that totally fine as well we've got healthy gamers in about 132 countries across the world at this point so feel free to just share our Resources with other people that's why we build them and that's why most of our stuff is available completely for free and the last thing is if y'all are looking for other kinds of events and things like that if you guys are looking for more accountability and involvement check out our Discord server cool we'll see y'all I think on Wednesday and then where I think at Amer or I'm going to be at American Psychiatric association on Friday cool
