if I recruit someone for your fancy rehab what that kind of means is that I'm gonna get a kickback also you'll have different rehabs that will kind of keep patients there because they want to stay full they want to make money there's all kinds of really shady stuff going on and I wish I could say I'm just a conspiracy theorist here but unfortunately that's really not the case let's talk a little bit about rehab centers so I want to talk to you about rehab centers because I think that in a sense rehab centers seem to be this the gold standard for overcoming addiction right when we see people who are struggling with addiction when we're thinking about addictions even celebrities or or people like that they'll say like oh this person is in rehab so when addictions kind of get out of control the idea is that the best thing that we can do is go to rehabs now there are a couple of things that are kind of interesting about rehab centers so I've worked in in a couple of rehab centers myself I really enjoy kind of working there I'm going to share that a little bit with y'all later but unfortunately there are a lot of things that are not ideal about rehabs centers and some things that are actually wrong and I'd love to talk to you all about that today so part of the reason that I want to talk about this is that if you think about people who are struggling with addiction what usually happens is we like struggle for a while we try to get it under control we try to cut back you know our family our loved ones friends people sort of tell us hey like you need to get this under control you need to cut back whatever so you try a little bit of this maybe you sign up to see a therapist maybe you call a psychiatrist they give you an appointment out in 2023 you know which is like six months away whatever and so we try to do a lot of stuff to overcome addictions we watch videos on the internet like whatever and it seems to not work a lot of times or we'll get a lot of pressure for family and sometimes family is like incredibly desperate right so especially with some of these like like there's a there's an opioid crisis in the United States right now A lot of people are overdosing um things like heroin and other drugs are getting cut with fentanyl people also have struggled with alcohol and stuff like that for a long time you know there are all kinds of problems that these substances will create addictions will create they'll destroy marriages they'll cause p people to lose their jobs they'll you know cause people to become physically hurt and accidents have you know physical side effects get HIV from sharing needles there are all kinds of high stakes when it comes to addiction and so what we've got is people who are struggling to handle this on their own or handle it at home and then we've got a bunch of people who really really care about you and the stakes are really high and sometimes including death right so what that sort of creates is the system where people so what that creates is an incentive to to sort of start residential treatment and residential treatment is like a 30-day rehab or two-week rehab or whatever and you're gonna go there and they're gonna fix you and you've got lots of loved ones who are who really need you to be fixed right and you yourself need to turn around your life you can't be addicted anymore so since it's intensive you go there you stay there for 30 days that makes it expensive and since frankly people are desperate that makes it expensive so I've worked at rehabs I've Heard lots of stories about this from patients you know even in my outpatient practice they'll do things like mortgage their house they'll do things like take out loans they'll do gofundme's they'll they'll raise money they'll say raise thirty thousand dollars fifty thousand dollars I've heard of some rehabs even caused causing a hundred costing a hundred thousand dollars for one month of treatment and people are actually willing to pay it the reason they're willing to pay it is because they're desperate right this is like we're talking about life and death here so I've seen parents that were talking about my son's life and in order to save his life we're willing to spend seventy thousand dollars for one month of treatment to get this under control and so when we've got a a vulnerable population when we've got a desperate population when we've got high stakes and a high intensity of treatment that leads to a lot of money and this is where unfortunately what I've seen is a lot of rehabs that I think don't really do a good job now part of the reason they I like to believe that part of the reason they don't do a good job is because is not like predatory in nature I like to think that they they think they're doing the best they can or they have particular beliefs about what makes the best rehab kind of treatment but unfortunately the truth is that a lot of these places are actually quite predatory and so I've seen so I worked at two uh rehabs predominantly one was an insurance-based rehab that you know patients pay very little or almost nothing out of pocket so it's kind of a different sort of place a lot more patience I was responsible for 28 to 29 patients usually on a given uh on a given day so over the course of let's say one week maybe like 10 of them will leave and I'll get 10 new patients so I'm caring for about 40 patients a week the other rehab that I worked at was a private pay rehab that cost a lot more was one of these like really nice both of them were actually in really beautiful locations but had really nice facilities I took care of like CEOs and and other like important people celebrities stuff like that that place was a way higher price tag there were maybe about 10 patients there at a given time so about a third to 25 percent of the size and what I really found what I heard from a lot of those CEOs is that they've been to other rehabs and their experience is that they go to this really nice place that's like out in Florida right where they like it's on the beach they go there everyone's really caring they get massages it's kind of this luxury rehab where it's focused on like wellness there's a lot of meditation and a lot of yoga and like we're gonna kind of like sober you up over 30 days you're gonna do like some kind of work but it's it's almost like this luxury vacation kind of rehab thing and the basic problem is that people will become sober over 30 days and why will they become sober because they're in a facility where you're being watched 24 7. right so you wake up in the morning and there's something going on and you go to bed at night and there's something going on you you stay in this particular room you don't leave the campus at all you have no access to drugs or alcohol so over the course of 30 days it's really easy to get sober when it's impossible to physically use then what happens is these rehabs do very little Aftercare and we'll talk about that what that means later but in the worst case is what they'll kind of do is like you feel great right after detoxing and being pampered for 30 days you feel amazing you've got a nice tan you're going swimming every day you're doing yoga you feel mentally really really really well and so you're like wow I feel amazing I've conquered this addiction and then you go back out you go home with very little Aftercare right so there's not really much of a plan in place work stress starts building up home stress starts building up you haven't really done a whole lot of deep emotional work you basically we took a 30-day vacation and so three months later you're back to using again back to drinking all that kind of stuff comes back so a lot of these rehabs will create an artificial environment where like it's really easy to be sober and then they'll send you back into their environment where you crash and then what happens what happens is that now after you crash a year later people are like man things were so good when you came back to that place and you yourself realize man I felt so good when I left I just screwed up so what am I going to do I'm gonna go back pay another seventy thousand dollars because it worked so well right and at the end of 30 days you feel amazing you're like wow this is it this time I'm gonna do it and you kind of go back out maybe you're sober for a couple months and then you kind of relapse so some of these places unfortunately I do think it's part of their business model we'll look at some data in a minute that actually encourages people to like come back right and I know that sometimes there are conspiracy theorists out there that'll say like oh like doctors want to keep people sick because that's how they make money my experience as a doctor has been that there's way way way more patients out there than I will ever be able to see and that I can help people get better and there's no shortage of people needing medical care I I really don't think that's true for most people in medicine and I even don't think that's true for the majority of rehabs I'd like to think I don't like I I don't think they try to keep people dependent on their services but I do think that for some of these places they actually don't prioritize long-term sobriety what they really prioritize is creating a really awesome 30-day experience and it turns out that this is not just me kind of thinking this right so it's not just conspiracy theories so let's actually look so in the New Jersey state legislature there's actually an investigation they this happened um let me see if I can find the exact date so this happened 10 10 days ago okay so these kinds of practices have been going on for a long time there's a lot of money to be made in addictions because people are desperate so let's take a listen to the New Jersey state legislatures state Commission on of Investigation on rehabs let's hear what they actually kind of say okay so this is like a committee that is they're going to publish a report probably in the next couple of days so this is not just Dr K's opinion on on things this is like literally the results of Investigation let's take a look it's in the federal government and it makes it easy for unethical practices to exploit people who are already in a vulnerable situation frequently with little consequence and it can be an overwhelming time in an unclear time to navigate the addiction Rehabilitation process we'll listen to about two minutes of this so the recovery industry theoretically exists to help people overcome their addictions and get them back to healthy and productive lives so listen to that the theora the uh the recovery system theoretically exists to help people with their addictions and get back to their lives right but the reality helped them recover and rebuild their lives oh my God comes more focus and the remuneration rather than healing broken lives fueling this vicious cycle is often immoral and illegal practices that you'll hear about today one known as patient brokering where corrupt players in the industry steer patients to a specific Treatment Center in exchange for some sort of financial payoff and this system is growing increasingly and it's getting more sophisticated as Brokers are finding ways to circumvent laws and banning practices and operating within gray areas of the law as well so you'll hear testimony today about the type of care patients are receiving for addiction treatment and how it may not be based on the services the individual actually needs in order to recover from their dependence and the quality of their private insurance coverage may play more of a role than the quality of care that they need and you'll also hear testimony today about this is important operators and Recovery industry employees here in New Jersey who engage in potentially unlawful practices to ensure patients have extended Insurance paid stays at their facility some manipulate drug tests or keep patients in the most intensive level of treatment even if no longer necessary for prolonged periods of time so we're going to pause there they go on to this talk about a lot of stuff but like basically what this commission is discovering is that so like we said there's there's big money to be made right so what's actually happening is people will like if I recruit someone for your fancy rehab what that kind of means is that I'm going to get a kickback also you'll have different rehabs that will kind of keep patients there because they want to stay full they want to make money there's all kinds of really shady stuff going on and I wish I could say I'm just a conspiracy theorist here but unfortunately that's really not the case and there seems to be actually a lot of data that there are a lot of problems with addiction recovery so what I'd love to do today is go through a couple of things first is explain a little bit about why addiction rehabs don't consistently have good outcomes is a field second thing I want to do today is talk about the different kinds of rehabs that I've sort of seen and you can blend them a little bit so like why are things why are things the way they are right now what are the different kinds of rehabs I want to share with you all a little bit about like what actually happens in rehab so what are the stages of rehab and like what what is like successful rehab treatment look like then I want to share with you all the four things that in my experience as a clinician like if we take one patient who's successful in one patient who isn't successful what's the difference and what is a successful course kind of look like and what is an unsuccessful course look like and hopefully what we'll do is equip you all with some information so that if you ever do need to seek a Addiction Rehab treatment or a loved one needs to seek rehab treatment that you're equipped with some information so that you can sort of tell who's good and who is that because unfortunately what happens is a lot of people will be like yeah we're really expensive we've got we're really great we've got this beautiful facility we'll make things work you know 99 of people are sober when they leave and and so like you don't really know right so like these people seem to know what they're talking about they're wearing fancy suits they're charging a lot of money you know they're they're talking a big game so like let's mortgage our house and send our son so let's start with why are things why is it hard to sort of tell what makes a residential treatments actually let me scrap that question so let's start with this which is why is it that there are a bunch of rehabs out there and we're not clear first of all whether they work really well or you know what works and what doesn't so the first thing that we have to understand is that research on addiction rehabs is very very very crappy to be blunt so even if you look at the number of studies that are published there are very very few peer-reviewed studies they tend to have very very low quality evidence and why is that it's because a study that that involves measuring someone for 30 days and then following them for a year is really really hard to do the other thing that I think is a little bit nefarious is that I think some of these rehabs don't have a vested interest in actually having third parties look at their outcomes right because they may not actually be very good so it's really hard to study Residential Treatment the other issue that we tend to have is that rehabs tend to be quite different and a lot of them are not really very evidence-based to begin with so a lot of rehabs will be based on 12-step kind of models and we'll look at some data on that and 12-step models can be really good they can help a lot of people but they don't necessarily work for everyone and they're not necessarily the standard of care when it comes to addiction treatment so part of the reason that addiction rehabs are the way they are is first of all it's really hard to study them and secondly there's a lot of stuff that they do that is not really like scientifically based so let's take a couple of a look at a couple of papers about rehabs okay and then we'll kind of illustrate this so first the effectiveness of residential treatment services for individuals of substance use disorders a systematic review let's kind of look at their major findings okay with caution results suggest that the best practice Rehabilitation treatment integrates mental health treatment and provides continuity of care post discharge so this is what I've kind of discovered as a as a provider is you can do whatever you want to for 30 days but unless you fix their outside environment or help them with the outside environment that they're going back to the chance of relapse is very very very high okay so even then if we kind of look at this so between January 13 and December 2018 so over five years there were only 23 studies published worldwide in the English language on rehabs which is a very very low level of of uh studies eight were methodologically strong five were moderate and ten were weak so we've only got eight studies on rehabs over a five-year period so it's hard to study and what we kind of know that the one big takeaway is Aftercare which we'll get so now I'm going to share with you all something from I think this is from Jama or nejam so Journal of the American Medical Association so first let's start with this there's something called opioid Agonist treatment which if someone is addicted to opioids like heroin the standard of care is to actually provide uh an analog of an opiate that people can sort of maintain so they don't go through withdrawal and don't have cravings and stuff like that but it's hard to abuse so there's this medication called Suboxone which makes it hard for it to be like injected and stuff like that it's chemically a little bit different but the key thing is that the standard of care for opioid use disorder like according to all the science we have the most effective treatment for opioid use disorder is opioid assisted treatment okay now for people kind of saying like Okay but wait if I'm if I'm prescribed an opioid and I have like a heroin addiction isn't that just like replacing one addiction with another and the answer is sort of but generally not really so my experience is that you got to give someone something in a controlled way in a measured way so they can't use more they're not necessarily using less and then like when someone struggles with addiction usually their life is falling apart and it's really hard to get a job and fix your relationships and stuff like that when you're dealing with Cravings every single day so opioid assisted treatment and this is according to the data right this is what seems to work the best my experience with opioid assistant treatment is that I'll use it for some amount of time and then eventually when they sort of get their life settled I will Advocate or at least have a discussion for getting off of opioid Agonist therapy and if they want to stay on it that's okay but I'll be like okay hey if things are stable like what do you think about this like now that one year out you've got a stable job your marriage is repaired you're done with family counseling what do you think about stopping this medication now and we'll kind of have an ongoing discussion and hopefully eventually I I'm as a psychiatrist I advocate for the minimum possible medication use sometimes people need it and that's totally fine so let's take a look at the standard of evidence the standard of care best available evidence for what is effective at helping heroin addicts get off of heroin nationally 107 programs 29 offered opioid Agonist therapy uh with the option of continued maintenance an additional 31 offered opioid assisted therapy for short-term detoxification which we'll get to in a second 60 of people will offer opioid uh Agnes therapy 39 did not offer opioid Agonist therapy in 78 programs 21 actively discourage the use of opioid Agnes therapy so this is really interesting right because what this is sort of suggesting is that 60 percent of people are unclear may not necessarily use it or will actively discourage the best scientifically valid treatment for addiction right I want you all to think about that for a second now there are good arguable good reasons for this so almost all programs offered some form of 12-step program right so 92 percent 92 percent of rehabs will offer some 12-step component and in the 12-step tradition many of those people are very very anti-agonist therapy these are not scientists though they're not medical doctors they're not doesn't mean that they don't have value they bring a lot to the table and 12-step programs have been shown to be effective at helping people overcome addiction but oftentimes those kinds of things will Clash so the best rehabs and we'll get to this in a second that I've seen sort of offer a spectrum and really try to create an individualized approach the downside that I've seen with 12-step programs a lot of these people are believers right they're like AAA is the only way and they start with it's very kind of like a lot of it will have like religious connotations to it and there's like a higher power and it's sort of based on like the Christian ethos and things like that and like a lot of them are like really really hard liners and it's kind of my way or the highway and if it's not working for you the reason is because you're not trying hard enough that's my complaint with some people who do 12-step stuff is that they don't acknowledge that hey maybe it's like our intervention could be better they don't acknowledge that if it if there's a failure it means you're not working hard enough next thing so this is a paper um that talks a little bit about you know what are the components to success in recovery so let's take a quick look at that so good rehabs will provide information and skills promote a working Alliance what does that mean that means that we're going to work together addiction is not something that you have to conquer on your own we're going to help you it's a team effort uh role modeling recovery so this is really interesting but like what does it mean to be sober what would your life be like to be sober what does it look like to be sober and having people in that you can kind of look up to and sort of see like oh this person has their life together they maintain their relationships they have a job that they find fulfilling they're like in good touch with their kids that's really important at helping people become sober and this is really important increasing choice right so like this is where if we look at kind of the the science on what leads to successful recovery giving empowering people who are struggling with addiction with Choice actually correlates with increased recovery and the challenge here is that when we go back to some of these 12-step programs right this is not 78 of people don't give patients a choice it's our way or the highway and since we don't have good data on these kinds of things and they're not really very well regulated like a lot of people are doing what they think is best and I kind of don't fault them for that but a lot of it is frankly like pretty ineffective that's kind of a quick review of The Evidence why are things as bad as they are I think that's we've sort of seen why because a lot of these rehabs are not actually based in science they're kind of based in peer recovery which is really important it's a really important aspect of the model but what we sort of know is that creating a personalized tailored approach to recovery because it worked for a thousand people does not mean it worked for you and the most success that I've seen in addiction recovery is when we sort of create a personalized approach so now let's take a quick look at the types of rehabs okay so this is just like according to Dr K so in my experience there are multiple types of rehabs the first is an evidence-based rehab so this is where I know it sounds kind of weird but they use things like science they offer medical treatment okay so I worked at two evidence-based rehabs so maybe I'm biased there but you know it's the reason I work there is because there's data that shows that it's the best way to do things and and so what that sort of means is that like you know you're going to see a psychiatrist you're going to see a therapist they'll teach you evidence-based techniques like mindfulness maybe motivational interviewing the people will there will be trained in scientifically valid techniques that help people overcome addiction second kind of rehab that we have is a 12-step program now these are not mutually exclusive but some of these will be very very evidence-based and have minimal on on 12-step stuff whereas a lot of places will be heavy heavy on 12-step stuff and will actually discourage evidence-based medicine as we already saw so these are rehabs that are oftentimes started by people who are are in recovery themselves so I struggled with addiction for 30 years I've been sober now for 20 years I want to make it my life's work to help other people which is totally great love that mission love that you want to give back and they create a program The Challenge is that you can you can learn a lot from personal experience but I think that it's not as effective as combining science with peer support even in terms of what we do at healthy Gamers so we've sort of built in on this kind of peer support program like our coaching program is a peer support program which is what the United Nations kind of recommends World Health Organization recommends we sort of see that these have value but they shouldn't be done exclusively especially when it comes to treating diseases That's my kind of opinion here Third Kind of rehab that we have is the luxury rehab and what does the luxury rehab these are places that are not even like 12-stepish they may have 12-step stuff but they're not like hardcore 12-step programs these are places that are essentially like 30-day vacations right so they're like more like wellness Spas they may have a doctor but the doctor or therapist are going to have like an excellent bedside Manner and may not necessarily offer like good clinical care right so some of them do some of them don't and we're not saying that there aren't evidence-based luxury rehabs as well but some of these places are going to focus on like yoga and the key thing about these luxury places is that you're kind of enforced sobriety so you're going to get sober because you have no choice but they're not going to build skills they're not going to do the deep emotional work that is necessary we're going to give you a really nice vacation where you can recharge and then when you go back there's a decent chance you're going to relapse and you had such a positive experience here you could give us 5 out of 5 Stars so you're going to come back and we're going to get ourselves another 70k easy okay now you can blend these so there are like I said I worked at One Insurance Place uh one sort of Cheaper rehab and one really expensive rehab that had some of these luxury things so like they were you know they had yoga and stuff in the morning which is totally fine I'm not you know I'm clearly not against yoga but you really want like a blend of this stuff and some people are more focused on the luxury than they are on the evidence-based side so next up we're going to talk about what happens when you're trying to get sober so the first thing to understand is the first step of sobriety is detox so this is detox is usually a physiologic and psychologic thing so when we're addicted to a substance a substance does two things for uh it has two kind of effects one it offers an emotional coping strategy so if we're feeling bad I can pop a pill and I can feel good but then the other thing that happens as we develop an addiction is we develop a physiologic dependence and even if you've never been addicted to a substance maybe I'll use caffeine right so you can think about someone who's like addicted to caffeine like half the population is addicted to caffeine when they wake up in the morning they feel non-functional without caffeine so the first stage of sobriety is detox and this is when your body is going through a physiologic withdrawal and this is so physically uh everything from painful to dangerous that people will seek out the substance so for example I've had a patient who has had stage four metastatic cancer and has been on chemotherapy and radiation therapy and has like cancer pain in their bones and stuff like that and they've been addicted to opiates so I was asking them what's worse having cancer all through your body and pain and like taking these medications and getting literally irradiated or going through opiate withdrawal and they said 100 opioid withdrawal I'd I'd take cancer any day of the week over opioid withdrawal so an opioid withdrawal you get really really nauseous you feel pain all over your body like your body just starts to hurt you can start to have diarrhea and sweatiness and your your like your nose is leaking all the time you've got the chills shakes it's apparently it just feels absolutely awful and so when people start to feel those things it can be so physically impairing that like the only relief you can get is from the opioid uh different kinds of substances will create different kinds of withdrawals so one thing that's really important to note is that alcohol withdrawal and benzodiazepine withdrawal these are medications like Xanax or valium can actually be life-threatening so as our body goes through a physiologic withdrawal from alcohol it causes it can potentially cause seizures and arrhythmias so alcohol is a CNS central nervous system depressant and what that means is that it kind of uh suppresses our nerves yeah for it's an oversimplification and so what happens is when when we take the alcohol away our nerves have adapted to alcohol being in the system and they've kind of compensated for that so let's say a nerve normally works over here and then what what happens is we add alcohol and when we add alcohol it sort of suppresses our our nervous function and then what happens over time is our brain adapts so we're back at Baseline right so this is what we think of as a functioning alcoholic they actually are drunk they're like they've got a high blood alcohol level but they appear completely normal cognitively they're normal you know like they're completely normal and so then when you remove the alcohol okay what ends up happening is their nerves become hypersensitive because now we're removing this depressant effect over here and then when their nerves become jittery they can actually have a seizure and can sometimes even go into into cardiac arrhythmias and and it can be lethal so detox feels awful for the most part and can also be like medically dangerous so sometimes detox has to happen in a hospital a couple of other things so when people talk about oh marijuana isn't addictive part of what they mean when people say marijuana isn't addictive is that we don't generally speaking develop a very strong physiologic tolerance to marijuana doesn't mean that it isn't psychologically addictive so we still kind of marijuana can be an emotional coping strategy for sure but you're not going to have at least I don't have I've never heard of anyone having seizures after like withdrawing from marijuana okay so that's stage one is detox so usually the detox stage lasts anywhere between let's say three and seven days it depends on what you're detoxing from and during that time it's like hard to do like much therapy and things like that because physically you just feel awful so usually detox needs to be managed medically so when I'm helping patients with opioid detox I'll give them various medications so like I'll give them like loperamide so that they don't have diarrhea 15 times a day so we try to make the the the detox as manageable as possible sometimes when people are detoxing off of alcohol we'll use things like benzodiazepines to help them safely detox off of it so you'll administer things like lorazepam and other kinds of medications to prevent people from having seizures and stuff like that and you kind of detox them off hopefully pretty smooth the second stage is kind of our residential treatment and this is when we start doing things like therapy right because now your detox your physiologically kind of back to square one so you can start doing things like therapy you're you're starting to like build skills we'll talk about what this what this kind of stuff is so this is like the 30-day rehab part right so maybe you detox at a different facility and then you go to a 30-day rehab but generally speaking let's say we're going to do this for about three weeks and so that's like when you're doing the work of rehab you're going to different groups you're talking about your feelings you're talking about substances maybe you're going to 12-step meetings you're learning how to meditate you're doing you're getting therapized maybe now that the substances are out of your system now a psychiatrist can actually like diagnose you with something because you can't diagnose someone with a mood disorder if they're actively using substances so maybe you're bipolar maybe you're not maybe it's all the cocaine and alcohol that you're using that makes you look bipolar whereas you're not actually bipolar but once you get kind of cleared out once the substance is clear out of your body then what the doctor can do is evaluate for other psychiatric illnesses things like that okay so this like the you know you're in rehab we'll talk more about what that is and then we get to the third stage and this is what is what I think is the most important is aftercare and in my opinion the biggest thing that separates good rehabs from Bad rehabs aside from people who are like you know openly predatory or unethical is the Aftercare plan so what I see in these 70k luxury rehabs is that they do a very bad job or some of them do a bad job of Aftercare and after care is like I don't want to say this but it's easy to be sober when you're like in a residential facility where you have no access to alcohol and drugs and people are helping you detox and you're hanging out with other sober people all the time you don't have your work stress you don't have your school stressed you don't have your family stressed you don't have your home stress you're kind of in a stress-free kind of environment where you can just focus on working on yourself then what happens is you go back into your old environment you go back into the stress and then it becomes really easy to relapse so good programs will set up Aftercare and so what is like an Aftercare plan from the places that I work look like it's like okay we're gonna where are you gonna go where will you live are there any risk factors there do you have roommates who get like use every day right where are you going to get psychiatric help so they'll help you make appointments and they'll make it even like sort of make appointments and if I'm calling from a rehab and I'm making an appointment I can usually get people in faster so the key thing here is they'll like set up appointments for you so that two weeks after discharge you're gonna go see this psychiatrist and you're gonna go see this therapist and so they set it up for you so that you've got Psychiatry appointments you've got therapy appointments are you going to do some sort of peer support recovery right are you going to go to 12-step meetings are you going to do Refuge recovery which is kind of like a Buddhist inspired peer support program right so it's not about the higher power and and sort of like god-oriented stuff it's like more about mindfulness and and like discovering whatever kind of spiritual stuff and things like that but they'll help you set all this stuff up in some cases the Aftercare will also involve things like you know helping you find alternate housing will help you do things like thinking about you know work or professional things including doing things like providing letters to your bosses that protect your privacy but also like you know explain to your boss that hey this person may need like a graduated return to work things like that so for example when I'm at rehab like sometimes we'd get students so 21 year old and I'm going to write a letter to his Dean and I'm going to say hey the kid needs to like have a halfway kid needs to take uh his his course load needs to be reduced by 50 over the course of this next semester because he's got all this other crap to do he's expected to do a b c and d right he's gonna go see therapist he's gonna go see psychiatrist and we sort of write that in a way that is is privacy protected but an official you know ladder comes from a doctor saying hey like you all need to cut this guy some slack he's trying to put his life together or she needs to try and put her life together Aftercare can also involve starting a lot of these conversations around relationships so like 30 percent of the patients at rehab that I work with is just a rough statistic are going through a separation or divorce a third and so are we patching that up are we proceeding with divorce like what's going on there because that's a bit major stressor so the key thing about Aftercare is it's about preemptively thinking about all the stresses that you could have to go back into and your treatment team at rehab starting to work on that kind of stuff so we don't want to send like if you're going through a divorce and we discharge you after like giving you a massage every day and going for a swim on the beach for 30 days in a row and then you're going back to your spouse who you haven't talked with except for a little bit and you're like yeah I'm sober like it's all good I conquered my addiction your spouse is like awesome and if your therapist hasn't had like conversations with them whereas like we meet with people like once a week we meet with family members if they want to Once once a week we're like hey what are the problems that are going on like what's the stress in your marriage how is the alcohol affected both of y'all how do you feel about that how do you feel about that how does that make you feel how does that make you feel I play referee you know so like if things get too heated I'm gonna like calm things down I'm gonna ask one person to step out of the room we're gonna work on it in the intervening week like we're gonna do some solid family therapy individual work we're gonna all do it together so that when you leave here we recognize that saving your marriage is an uphill battle but we kind of know what we're dealing with instead of yeah it's 30 days I'm sober I feel really good I got daily massages and it's all good okay after care is crucial so now what I want to do is talk to you all a little bit about what leads to success in subride so this perspective is kind of like my take on when people do a good job at rehab what changes for them like when someone comes in on day one and they leave on day 30 what's different and it comes down to four things the first thing is awareness of triggers so substance use is highly environmental like we kind of know this and so a key thing about staying sober is like controlling your exposure to triggers so triggers can be everything from roommates who get high every day two x's who use heroin and who will hit you up it can be even things like uh you know work related stress or family related stress every time my parents ask me like you know when am I going to move out of the house when am I going to move out of the house when am I going to move out of the house every time my my wife or husband nags me about a particular thing it makes me want to forget and use and like it's really really stressful so you have to know what are the things that trigger your desire to use and Trigger Cravings now we're not saying that you have to avoid all of those things because some of that stuff may be necessary but you have to have an awareness of your triggers and I know it sounds kind of simple but like a lot of times we don't think about that in addiction there are even studies that kind of show that sometimes if you ask people okay why'd you relapse they'll say I was doing fine I was doing fine I don't know what happened I just slipped up and the more that I tunnel down into it it's like what do you mean you just slipped up like so walk me through the sequence of events you've been sober for 12 weeks you were sober on Wednesday morning and then you had a binge over the weekend how was Thursday Thursday was fine what about Friday well Friday at 6 p.m I got a text from my ex they're asking like hey you want to hang out and then they sent me a provocative picture and I was like sure right and then we started texting back and forth I met up with my ex on Saturday night and then I used for 24 hours okay well right so like what are your triggers second thing that happens this is what I call deep emotional work this is what leads to success so if you look at addictions the most common feature of all addictions is that they're coping mechanisms so if we look at a human being and they're psyche right so there's like if there's like really toxic stuff down here that I can't manage I'm gonna need to like add a substance to kind of quiet that out so we can think about okay what are the triggers but then what we also want to do is like empty out some of this stuff empty out some of like the deep emotional work right so that this stuff kind of like leaks out the bottom and then where we start to like feel better so this is where like if you look at like the a history of childhood abuse for example correlates with addiction and so like as you start to feel really really ashamed of yourself right I'll give you all just like an example of a thought that people who struggle with addiction will have I'm a worthless piece of crap so why not use it's not like I'm gonna accomplish anything anyway might as well get some joy out of life like I don't deserve to be happy so why not just screw up like why not just screw up my life right it's not like people give a [ __ ] about me these are the kinds of thoughts that you'll have I don't think that those that's true I think people do care about you and I think you do deserve to have a good life but that involves that deep emotional work you can't massage your way to sobriety you gotta actually like do that hard work ask those hard questions what do you want to be in life life what is this addiction done to you what's the harm you've caused do you deserve to be happy in life who taught you that you don't deserve to be happy in life these are like these deep cathartic conversations which sometimes you'll see on on stream next thing that leads to sobriety is development of coping skills okay so development of coping skills is remember that we've we're going to have to face some triggers we can't devoid all the triggers and we can do some of this deep emotional work right we can empty this out a little bit but at some point we're going to be in a situation where we feel emotionally bad or emotionally stressed and we've got to have some kind of alternative as opposed to the substance that will help us emotionally cope now this is really important it's very hard to develop coping skills when things are on fire so the thing about developing coping skills is when you first start to use a coping skill let's say that y-axis is emotional relief and x-axis is time okay if I start meditating today what do you think the emotional relief that I get from meditation is so this is interesting when you're developing A coping skill this is what the curve looks like because this first segment of time it's not like you feel instant relief with meditation right actually at the beginning meditation is even more stressful because you're not even doing it right it doesn't help you at all so it's like you're paying a cost you're not even getting a benefit then things start to turn around and then after like two weeks of meditating you really start to get the hang of it and we know that clinically for example we see statistically significant improvements in psychiatric diagnoses usually by like the six to eight week Mark in terms of mindfulness interventions so it's like really hard to like you can't develop an alternate coping skill while you're detoxing right you gotta detox first be in a good place be stable it's kind of like trying like so I see this a lot where like people will be actively using right they're like they're they're using and they need to learn how to meditate because that helps with addiction it's like trying to learn how to swim in the middle of the Arctic Ocean you gotta learn how to swim in Quiet Waters right like learn how to swim in a kiddie pool learn and then you can start to swim in like like bigger bigger bigger waves so a key part of that 30-day course is when I have a patient who comes in for 30 days of rehab I'm thinking to myself okay like what are the coping skills that they're gonna need 30 days out and we've got 30 days to teach them how to swim last thing is environmental planning so we've kind of talked about this a little bit already but this is where you know as a psychiatrist it's kind of like I'm responsible for this person here right and this is one of the other reasons why I think a lot of rehabs are not affected because they're like my job is to take care of you here it's not to find you a new roommate the good rehabs will will help you go work through that kind of stuff but the key thing is that when we think about these triggers and we think about coping skills and stuff like that the truth of the matter is that a lot of substance use is associated with life stressors so for example in New York maybe 30 years ago in order to get public or subsidized housing government housing you had to be sober because they're like we don't want addicts using it like you got to get sober first and then we'll give you housing for free this is what we need you to do and then someone realized that it's really hard to get sober while you're homeless so New York instituted this awesome program called housing first we're like we don't care if you use or not we're going to give you a roof over your head and lo and behold when people like aren't homeless it's actually easier to get sober as opposed to the other way around there has to be environmental planning involved so what's your work situation like what's your family situation like what's your intimate relationship situation like what's your what what's your friend's circle like what are your roommates like and thinking about all of these stressors and helping someone craft a plan okay so I'm gonna like avoid talking to my mother-in-law for one month after I leave because that's just too much to handle I'm going to focus on getting back into work I'm going to focus on rebuilding my relationship with my significant other and I'm gonna try to move out that's what I'm gonna and mother-in-law comes later and I'm gonna go to meetings I'm gonna see a psychiatrist I'm going to see a therapist you have to like plan things out in a lot of environmental planning and when people do these four things they become aware of their triggers they do the deep emotional work they start developing to develop coping skills and they do some amount of environmental planning this is when oh sorry this is when I tend to see success with with rehabs last thing that we're going to do is go through a couple of examples so here's person one goes to the luxury rehab okay so what they usually do is they do let's say like days one to five they do detox at a hospital locked inpatient psychiatric unit so they detox off of alcohol they don't like it there the food sucks they're crazy people there then on day five they move to the luxury rehab I get a big screen TV I get a private room I start taking walks on the beach and then for the next kind of like let's say 25 days they're doing some work they go to a couple meetings meetings are optional there's no restriction on things like cell phones or devices or stuff like that so I can hang out in my room and like be on my phone if I feel like it I'm gonna have a private Chef I'm gonna do some yoga I'm gonna kind of detox I'm gonna talk some about my feelings people well since I'm paying 70k I'm the boss so I'm paying 70 000 to be here I don't what are they gonna do kick me out on week two if I don't show up to some meeting so people show up like as I start to slack off people show up and they're like hey like you should really come to this like we want you to come this you're like yeah okay I'll come you come the next day day after that you don't come you do the yoga you go for the beach you have some uh you know you have a lot of people kind of like that are very like ego supportive so like they're very compassionate and they're listening to you you go and you vent about your problems right you do a lot of venting and there's like staff that's very very compassionate they're like oh it's so hard to be you bro it's so hard to you be you girl oh like your husband is abusive like oh your wife is abusive they're so neglectful like life is hard for you you're such a beautiful person they don't challenge you they don't be like hey like it takes two to ruin a marriage and it's kind of great and then you leave with a tan you leave feeling good like you're gonna take over the world you've kicked the addiction you've conquered it they don't tell you hey this is a lifelong journey and you're going to continue to struggle and like let's set up a psychiatrist or therapist yeah you don't need that kind of stuff you're fixed option number two okay so you do detox let's say at an inpatient locked facility at day five you move over and then people start to ask you questions so like people are are compassionate but they're also challenging they're a little bit more strict in terms of attendance like they're kind of like hey you're here to get sober you're not here to be this isn't a vacation they're going to emphasize skills building you start doing deep emotional work you really connect with a therapist you really like them a lot you see a doctor a couple times a week you know so multiple Psychiatry appointments meds change if they need to they're willing to offer opioid assisted therapy if you need it and then you know at week two you're also doing things like doing family therapy you're also doing things like figuring out work related stuff you're having tense conversations with your partner about the state of your marriage and divorce they're not pleasant they're not fun but you're starting to do the work here you're doing a lot of challenging work with a lot of support then people on week two start to develop Aftercare plan you've only been here for two weeks since the halfway point and we're going to start planning for you to leave it's kind of weird right because that's what it takes to set up good Aftercare and while we're setting up Aftercare I want you to go to a 12-step meeting I want you to go to an AAA meeting I want you to go to a refuge recovery meeting I want you to go to smart meeting so on Tuesday Wednesday Thursday this week and Tuesday Wednesday Thursday next week you're going to go to both all three of those meetings so one meeting a day and you're gonna tell me which one you like as opposed to these guys who are like oh by the way like you can go to a if you want to and then you go to a and you're like yeah that's not really for me but then what you go two weeks after discharge you go to your first a meeting you decide it's not for you and then you're like I don't need it I'm sober whereas here people are like trying things this is what a good successful rehab experience looks like and then hopefully you've set up good Aftercare and when you leave like you're not it's not a vacation it's that you've been fighting a war and losing all this time but now finally like you you have a plan of attack you recognize who the enemy is you recognize what your vulnerabilities are you recognize that you have some deep emotional work that you started on but that you have a long way to go you've developed some coping skills to replace substances the challenge is that when it comes to rehabs they're not incentivized to do all this stuff in the worst cases people are actually incentivized to set you up to fail but love them I don't think that's the majority but I I wish I could really say that with 100 confidence and and there's also a lot of other reasons why a lot of rehabs are not effective and that's because people show up with the best of intentions right I've been sober for 20 years it worked for me it's worked for hundreds of people but it also hasn't worked for hundreds of people but this it's my way or the highway it's like this is the way to sobriety and if you guys have done like work with sobriety you all will meet these people whether they're like super hardcore right incredibly rigid and so the problem is even if you go to one of those rehabs like those people will say like hey if you show up here and you do the work half of the people wash out and they say it like it's a point of Pride it's the people who are serious enough who will be sober and so either you make the cut or you don't make the cut and I don't think that that's like effectively the best way to to help people with sobriety it works for some people temperamentally and so the big challenge with rehab is that we have a lot of people who are desperate and the stakes are high and it is an intensive expensive treatment and the more that we sort of combine those when you've got a resource intensive thing in a group of desperate people that's when you get mortgages that's when you have people taking out loans that's when you have people selling cars that's when you have people who are like trying to like borrow money from all their friends and family to fund fifty thousand dollars for 30 days of residential treatment that may not even be scientifically valid and when you have a system like this that doesn't measure outcomes that doesn't hold rehabs accountable you end up with what you have in New Jersey which is a situation where you've got a bunch of rehabs that are at the worst predatory and unfortunately a lot of them are probably just religion half of whom don't actually use the standard of care the best evidence-based treatment for things like opioid Addiction in a country where we have an opioid crisis National Health Emergency and half of our residential treatment centers are not even using the best tool that we have the truth of the matter is that residential treatment is like Rife with all kinds of problems there aren't really good checks and balances a lot of people in my opinion don't really know what they're doing you can maybe argue that it's ignorant for me to make that criticism because I've only you know I only worked at two rehabs I worked there for like two to three years it's not like I have 30 years of experience under my belt so fair enough if you want to say my perspective isn't as valid as those other people's but there's a lot of data to support this and so if you're interested in rehab what I'd strongly recommend is if you call a place you ask questions like this ask them what's your treatment philosophy do you see Psychiatry like do you all have mental health clinicians there what kind of clinicians do you all use an nurse practitioner or do you have a medical doctor or is it a team of both do you all have therapists how often will I see a medical doctor how often will I see a nurse practitioner how often will I see my therapist what kind of things do therapists work on what kind of therapy do you use do you all what do you emphasize in your program how much of it is 12-step how much of it is coping skills and this is really really crucially important what does Aftercare planning look like at your facility hopefully if you ask these questions you'll be able to tell because all of them will have the same price tag 50k 60k 70k sometimes or although it can be a lot cheaper in Insurance based but even if you're talking about insurance-based ones like you can ask them these kinds of questions because what we also learned from the the New Jersey commission is that a lot of these places that are Insurance based they'll just keep you there including up to and including falsifying drug tests so you're not allowed to be discharged and when people are falsifying drug tests to keep you there do you think they're actually trying to help you of course not you're a prisoner and every day you're at the prison the facility is being paid eight hundred thousand twelve hundred dollars so ask these kinds of questions before you go and hopefully you know places that can give you good answers or places that I would trust a little bit more so that's kind of my take on rehabs it's a it's a place that's Rife with bad information um because a lot of this stuff isn't published it's hard to research a lot of these places are for-profit so they don't really publish their outcomes they're not really vetted by Third parties there's no peer-reviewed research Publications and things like that so you got to be careful which is unfortunate because the the stakes are high when it comes to addiction
