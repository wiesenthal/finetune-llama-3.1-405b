my kid is bipolar my kid is bipolar and I'll be like what does that mean bipolar so that is woefully incorrect so I mean that could be true right but I don't know if you want to do that I don't understand quite what that is that was actually pretty good that was that was good we're doing Tik Tok reacts chat shall we move on people are going to wish that at some point they had taken a little time to care just a little goddamn [Music] bit okay so this is uh actually somewhat I want to talk about this for a second so you know sometimes like we think about this and like people will say like oh this person is bipolar like they're so distressed they want to you know be what did this person say want to be me having a whole breakdown shaking on the floor and wishing I was I'm assuming that's it would have edit out dead which is why they're saying that but so this is actually pretty common where sometimes when we have emotional lability is the term so we're going to talk for a second about bipolar and emotional lability so a lot of people will come to me especially like parents they'll say like my kid is bipolar my kid is bipolar and I'll be like what does that mean bipolar they'll say like well one minute they're like happy and the next minute they're like raging right they're happy when they're playing their video game and the second I unplug the internet they're like raging at me so this is actually relatively common where sometimes when people have intense internal distress they'll think that they're bipolar but really what it is is emotional ability and what we see is that you'll have this intense distress and then they'll even use suicidal language but it's not really like suicidality this is where you have to really evalu them right so when you're when I'm doing an evaluation this are the kinds of questions that I'll ask be like when you say you want to be dead like what does that mean does that mean that you want to not feel this way anymore and that's why you're saying that you want to be dead or you like don't enjoy life and you Despair and you know like there's nothing to look forward to and then often times if you start to Tunnel down into those questions what you'll find is that when people are are very emotionally distressed the best way we know how to communicate that is with like suicidal kind of language and I know it's kind of weird but it's sort of like I don't feel good on the inside like that doesn't mean anything to anyone right if you walk around you say I don't feel good on the inside like how do people respond to that no one knows okay did you eat something bad like that that's what people are going to say right whereas if you say like I don't want to be alive anymore people understand that that is a that is language that's used to communicate distress you're trying to tell people hey I feel really terrible and then often times when you have people who who have emotional ability as opposed to bipolar disorder you'll sort of see that people will bounce back pretty quickly and so that's kind of common now sometimes this can be a sign of a psychiatric illness I mean if you're having suicidal thoughts you should absolutely absolutely go see someone but bipolar disorder is generally speaking characterized by periods of time like weeks of feeling a particular way it's not like feeling this way one minute and this way the next minute that's really more emotional ability [Music] I don't understand quite what that is so this person I guess this means okay intrusive thoughts I'm confused so y'all have to explain to me what what this person is trying to convey oh brain is overheating from stress yeah so this too I mean hopefully we'll have something for yall soon about this but I think somewhere along the way we've lost control of our minds I I don't know how else to say this but so you know like we control our bodies right like I can do this I can do this I can do stuff with my body but when it comes to like our mind we've like lost control of it and I think honestly technolog is making it worse because what's happening with technology is when I feel bad about stuff now what do I do I don't use I don't force my mind to do something I use technology as a crutch to make it do something so when I'm bored for example example like if I'm trying to study I can't restrain my attention on the object of study why is that it's because when my mind gets bored I'll go watch something and then it removes the need for my mind to be forced to do a particular thing is this does that make sense it's like we used to need to force our mind to do things but now with like technology it's like it's so easy for our mind to be like this like I mean [Music] just right and so what we end up doing is we just end up turning to like when when we're mentally distressed like that what do you think this person does they end up watching something or being on Tik Tok or whatever right and then once you like once you create that sense of distraction you play a video game then the mind kind of calms down and then when you stop doing that sort of thing it starts up again and so then you end up in a situation where you kind of get like this crutch where you're sort of dependent on technology for managing like the overheating thoughts and emotions in your head cuz you're using technology you're using something like an engaging YouTube video or a dopam energic meme or a very intense like horror video game to calm your mind down and create certain states of mind for you and the more that you use the technology to create this state of mind within you the more dependent you become on it because you don't know how to make it on your own and once you get to the point where like you've really lost a lot of that capacity then you end up like this where you just your thoughts are just all over the place dangerous mama I caught the ADHD it's not contagious jimothy but why do you say that cuz this guy on Tic Tac is relatable jimothy don't go self diagnosing on Tik Tac why not Mama because everyone on planet Earth will experience an ADHD symptom once in a while because we all have executive functions the distinct difference is whether those symptoms happen once in a while or they intrude on your daily life and are reoccurring more often I thought everyone's ADHD was different mom well this is just based on the current criteria in the dsm5 which is controversial within itself how do I know if I truly got it told jth that Tik tocker has a link in his bio to a self screening test so you can fill that out we'll talk about it and then we can go to your doctor thanks Mama that was actually pretty good that was that was good more Nuance than I was expecting yeah so okay let's talk about this for a second so first thing is that this is like a pretty accurate representation so remember that ADHD so like is really good actually so a lot of people are going to have symptoms of ADHD right and so this is the problem with sort of like the Google MD which is that like if you look for a particular symptom you know you can sort of find it as part of an illness but the key thing about like true diagnosis is that it's not just whether you check that box it's like it's a constellation of different things it's the severity how often do you check that box this person's good he talks about you know how it's like it's it's everyone's going to experience stuff occasionally it's about the consistency of what you experience which is excellent they also managed to talk about how the DSM is controversial which it absolutely is and if you all are not aware of what he's talking about so let's just talk about the DSM for a second so a long time ago um there were a group of researchers who were trying to figure out how are we going to make the the research that we do uniform so if I'm making an anti-depressant medication and you're making an anti-depressant medication how do we determine whether the people that are coming into our study are depressed or not depressed that's the main question they had what they came up with was something called the diagnostic and statistic manual and they said when we're going to study people who have depression these are the criteria we're going to use this is the line that we're going to draw people on this side of the line have depression or okay for the study people on that side of the line are not don't have depression or not okay for the study but it's a research tool it's it's a set of inclusion criteria for a scientific study which is different right it's just like who gets in the study it doesn't necessarily mean they're depressed or not depressed it's a way of uniform creating uniformity between studies so Along Comes the DSM it's fantastic I think it's a really good Innovation but it's not a clinical tool it's a research tool then what happens is like insurance companies kind of come along and they're sort of trying to figure out okay how do we tell if this person is like getting treatment or not getting treatment if they're doing a good job or not doing a good job and remember that these research studies are tracking certain symptoms within this population so now insurance starts using the DSM to determine whether they're going to pay you to see this person or not because if the person does not meet DSM criteria we're not going to pay you and that's what that then suddenly like it becomes like part of a clinical treatment and now it's being used clinically but the key thing about the DSM it was never designed as a clinical tool it was not designed for humans it was designed as a research tool for inclusion criteria so that creates a lot of the controversy because this is the tricky thing about the DSM is you can meet DSM criteria and have the disease or meet DSM criteria and not have the disease because it's checkboxes the other the flip of it is also true where you can not meet DSM criteria so you don't check enough boxes and you still have the disease and you cannot meet DSM criteria and you can have uh and and you Cann have the disease too so it's kind of interesting because it's not like a gold standard it's like a set of you know five or seven or nine or 12 different criteria and if you have like five out of the nine criteria for major depressive disorder you get diagnosed and so this is kind of like really common and I think it's actually a good representation of how it's really easy to see something relate to it and then want to give yourself a diagnosis but that's not really appropriate and I I actually think this is good what this person is saying is that you know by all means fill out a screening questionnaire and then go talk to an actual doctor because that's what clinical diagnosis is all about this is pretty good so it says nothing no it doesn't say nothing this is important what it does is it's really a research tool so what it does is it gives you a probability but it's not a it's not a diagnostic tool right so it sort of says if I take a thousand people who who check five of these nine boxes you know there's an 80% chance that these people will have depression for example so it's a probabilistic tool that's what makes things really really hard and the other thing about DSM criteria is that they tend to be like subtle and Nuance there's also a bunch of stuff that's not I mean that's a part of DSM criteria that you'll never see on Tik Tok so for example if you're talking about major depressive disorder you have to have symptoms for at least two weeks so the single most thing that is absent from most of the social media analysis of mental health is the duration of symptoms in the frequency of syp it's the time Dimension what everyone talks about is like the actual symptom or what is emotionally relatable without talking about duration and frequency and intensity and stuff like that and that's a huge part of the DSM it's like oh I'm sad today does that make you dep like clinical depression does that mean you have MDD no has to be present for at least two weeks [Music] yeah so this is the problem so this is good in a sense right so I think this person's trying to educate people and stuff like that that's pretty cool um but I think that the challenge here is that each of these symptoms has a differential right so like this is this is what I think is kind of a little bit problematic about this kind of this is why diagnos I I don't know if this what this was supposed to turn into but it's what it's turning into so what we're going to do is take a look at we're going to explain some Basics about diagnosis today okay so this is the basic problem with like social media and mental health stuff so now let's let's look at this here's the problem with this so this is good in a sense so if we look at ADHD at work and people do people who struggle with time management could they have ADH yes that is correct it is accurate do they struggle with deadlines yes that is accurate can they get into arguments at work yes that is accurate and I don't really blame these people for doing this I think they're trying to spread awareness and stuff but the problem is that in medicine we have a differential diagnosis so that means is that there's a bunch of other stuff so let's say I'm a narcissistic [ __ ] am I going to have problems with time management at work very possibly because I don't really care about showing up to meetings cuz I don't care about other people deadlines if it's not important to me then like who cares about that do I get into arguments at work absolutely now let's look at other substance use let's say I am addicted to opiates could I have trouble with time management absolutely could I miss deadlines at work absolutely could I get into arguments absolutely right and like the list goes on like it doesn't even have to be medical stuff it's like what if I'm mentally checked out and don't give a [ __ ] a problem with time management sure do I miss deadlines sure do I get into arguments with people at work absolutely so here's the challenge right so I think that like this is the problem the fundamental problem with this kind of mental health information is that you can check the boxes and the person's right like those are common manifestations it's also really interesting that they included arguments so for example let's go into this for a second because I think this is actually really cool an under underappreciated symptom of ADHD is attentional problems within conversation so a lot of the workplace conflict that I see with people with ADHD is they're like they're having a conversation someone is like hey can you make sure you mail that out before the end of the day and you're distracted so you say yeah sure and then you don't do it and then they get pissed at you the next day CU you're not attending to the conversation and this also manifests as what people think forgetfulness but it's not that you're forgetful it's that it never sank in in the first place you have no problem with recall it's that you weren't attending to that information when it came in so I think this is it's cool because this person is sort of highlighting that it's not just executive function things it's not time management and deadlines and stuff like that the other interesting thing which we won't go into is there's even some contrary research that shows that people with ADHD actually respond better in situations with deadlines and crises so if you have ADHD for example I've seen that a lot of people work really well in real estate with ADHD because they actually have tons of crises and deadlines and that somehow like keeps them motivated to like and strangely enough they're not like fully organized I don't know if you all have like seen like real estate people who aren't fully organized but they kind of like show up and you know they kind of get things done and and stuff like that it's kind of weird but I I think you know when yall are watching stuff on Tik Tok like it's cool to sort of relate to this and the the problem is that that doesn't mean that you have ADHD because there could be all kinds of other things that could be going on as well part 54 if two people are arguing stand between them and eat something it'll help alleviate the tension when you want to motivate yourself ask will I instead of saying I will this makes you want to do it more if you want someone to be honest ask them questions at night people open up when they're tired wait what psychology hacks part 54 if two people are arguing stand between them and eat stand between them and eat something so I mean that could be true right but I don't know if you want to do that like I'm confused like if if my parents are having a fight is this person suggesting that I stand between my parents and start eating food I I mean I know I know it works so there there's there's like there's validity to this I'm not saying it's not it right so like generally speaking when people are angry with each other there's a lot of eye contact there's body language you can kind of disrupt that by standing between them and disrupting the eye contact and body language but I'm not sure there's also a lot of stuff around eating which I think is actually pretty good here because eating is kind of a general so there's this other thing from uh just something you learn in residency is it's it's hard for people to be pissed at you when you guys are eating something together so when people were like mad at me often times we'd start with like food like in the emergency room it's like hey man do you want to eat something they're like no it's like here like have a cracker like I'll have a cracker you have a cracker you're eating you're kind of like it kind of disrupts the flow of things it's actually it's not I just don't know that I don't know how practical this is like are you walking around with a piece of Apple to just stand between people when they're arguing something it'll help alleviate detention when you want to motivate yourself ask Will i instead of saying I will I don't know if I agree with that one when you motivate when you want to motivate yourself ask Will i instead of I will but what if the answer is no right I'm not I'm not sure about that so this could be also touching on motivational interviewing and you know like because so in motivational interviewing we know that telling people to do things before they're ready is bad so forcing people to commit to things when they're not ready to commit is tends to be a mistake what's more effective is asking them because then you're trying to get a sense of what their internal conflict is so this is kind of good because it touches on ambivalence which is like you know before I commit to something I'm conflicted right so conflict comes before commitment and that internal conflict one of the ways in motivational interviewing that we address that internal conflict is by asking people like open-ended questions about okay are you going to study today why or why not and then as people think through why they may or may not study that does actually move them towards motivation so there could be some sense of this that is correct um but I don't know that just asking yourself will I is more motivating than I will because I've seen the opposite too which is later on when you get into you know like later stages of like addiction recovery and stuff you don't want to ask yourself will I have a drink today you want to say like I ain't going to have a drink today come hell or high water it ain't going to happen so at some point you want to commit but there's some value to this it's interesting this makes you want to do it more if you want I don't think that's true it depends on where you are cognitively someone to be honest ask them questions at night people open up when they're tired that could be somewhat true too so people are sometimes disinhibited when they are tired and when they are disinhibited you may get different answers that may be less covered by their inhibitions but there are a couple of important assumptions there the first is that assuming people are tired at night which is like I'm not sure if that's the case like maybe ask him first thing in the morning and I I don't the other thing is that you're going to get just because the answer is disinhibited does not mean that it is a better answer so for example like our inhibitions are a very very important part of our social functioning and so this is where I don't know how to say this but like the world thrives on inhibited people being able to talk to each other so I don't know that you actually want to do that but I mean it's true that people are sometimes disinhibited when they're tired here's a dark psychology trick to make anybody fall in love with you this is 100% manipulation I do not recommend doing this to anybody because it is super toxic and I'm only making a video on it so you can at least be aware of if it's happening to you it's just a three-step hot and cold technique where you first have to build up a pattern of pleasure and validation just making this person feel amazing around you and then you have to break it emotionally and physically you have to pull away from them because this is going to make them feel insecure like [ __ ] most importantly the need to Chase and get that validation back from you that they just got addicted to and then you just have to turn that on button back on again and start validating them this is going to make them fall in love with you but in a very unhealthy attachment Style you know until they figure out what the [ __ ] you're doing good luck so that is woefully incorrect so let's talk about this for a second this may work but here's the biggest is here's a dark psychology trick to make is the word anybody this isn't going to work on anybody this is going to work on a very very small percentage of people that are insecure and can be manipulated by overt validation which maybe that's a larger percentage of the population than I expect especially if this is Tik Tok I don't know but I think so here's the the general principle is true if you take someone who's woefully insecure and you are really really nice to them and validate them a lot they may really appreciate that and then if you start being mean to them they may dislike you and try to get that validation back which is sort of true and I think the person mentioned insecure attachment which is what this sort of sounds like but I don't think this is going to work on anyone so so like let's just think through this critically for a second okay if someone walks up to you and starts just saying all these wonderful nice things about you and then they start calling you names a little while afterward like what are you going to do are you going to try to get into their good graces again if you're like me you're going to be like first of all when someone comes into you like oh my God you're such an amazing person oh my God that's so awesome you're so handsome and beautiful and intelligent and all that kind of stuff my first thought is what are you trying to sell me you know like so I think this works if someone here's here's the biggest problem with I think a lot of this psychology stuff is that there's an assumption that people are monolithic psychologically like that we're like it's like we're not like motherboards where you can just plug something in and it has a particular effect like yeah if you have someone who's very insecure and you start validating them they will like that and then if you're mean to them they will dislike it and they may try to get into your good graces but that starts with a very particular kind of person so I I I don't know that sure it's manipulative and I think people do that right so this is what people will learn these patterns they'll learn like especially if you've grown up in an abusive relationship if this was done to you you learn how to do it to other people which is like I'm going to be hot warm and cold and then what happens when you do that because there is value to that it it sort of teaches people that it's almost like a random reinforcement schedule and so if you create a random reinforcement schedule it encourages Behavior so if you're like nice to people one day and mean to people another day that can actually encourage them that shapes their behavior more powerfully than if you're nice to them you know every single day in a weird way there's a certain arbitrariness that can encourage a particular kind of behavior the problem is that this only works on people who like lack some fundamental amount of security in themselves because if people are like fundamentally secure they're going to be like what the [ __ ] is wrong with you like this person's crazy you know I don't understand what's going on and it's like a gambling Machine Works excellent so I think it can work but it's just it's not going to work on anyone it's just going to work on people who are insecure and you know that it's just weird I I don't know yeah so like workaholic parents is like another good example of just people that you know you they'll they'll treat their kids really nice one day won't treat them well the next day like sometimes you get and Daddy's attention and sometimes you don't get mommy and daddy's attention which can really exacerbate certain kinds of acting out behaviors and I I also don't know I mean this person says fall in love with you I don't think that they're falling in love with you I think they're you're emotionally manipulating them sure but I don't know what is going to happen and like they kind of said this is kind of accurate that it's like it's an unhealthy kind of love because it's not love it's it's some weird I I don't think that you want to be in that situation of of yeah it just doesn't cuz if if you want any kind of real relationship with this person like what's the foundation of your relationship I don't think it's going to grow into anything it's just going to be toxic you know I mean I do think that it's it's the general principle of um validating people who are insecure to get them to like you is like correct I don't know that they're going to like you I mean hopefully they'll appreciate you as a human being and then I don't yeah yeah it's it's founded on on their own emotional security so there's like it's sort of like saying if you want to get if you want to get someone who's starving to like you start feeding them and then stop feeding them and then they'll do whatever they can to get you to feed them again it's like yeah that's kind of correct but that assumes that the person is starving to begin with and has no other place to get food right it's like if you're the only source of emotional validation from someone who's insecure then they can become dependent on on you it's not wrong it's just I don't know what the utility of it is
