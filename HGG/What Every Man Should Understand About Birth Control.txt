all right my dudes today we're going to talk about birth control generally speaking men are totally fine with blood right so like if you talk to most dudes like we're totally cool watching a scary movie where some you know Monster is tearing people apart or we're totally fine playing video games where there's like blood and gore and guts and like finishing moves and Mortal Kombat or like whatever so we're totally fine with that unless it's menstrual blood and if it's menstrual blood we're kind of like denethor from Lord of the Rings I don't know if you all have seen that or remember that whereas Suddenly It's like flee flee Flee for your lives like this dude has been sitting there fighting the armies of Sauron for like his entire life and one thing happens and suddenly he drops everything and has to run away and goes completely crazy that's what we're like when it comes to menstruation hey there thanks for watching and I'm glad these videos have been helpful a lot of times I'll read the comments and see people asking well what do I actually do about it which is a great question and unfortunately the resources out there haven't been that great which is precisely why I started HD in the first place HG coaches are trained on a curriculum that integrates my understanding of what motivates us what paralyzes us and most importantly what leads to Lasting behavioral change if you're ready to take the next step HG coaches can help you build the life that you want they've helped people build careers help people find relationships build networks of friends and even do things like discover their passions or pursue Hobbies so if this sounds like something that you'd be interested in check out the link in the description below so today we're going to talk a little bit about menstruation female ovulatory Cycles which I know are not I know it sounds kind of weird but this is not like bizarre esoteric knowledge that is reserved only for doctors and like Pagan witches right like this is these are normal bodily functions that every human being should know about in the same way that women should understand like okay this is an erection not every time a dude gets an erection does it mean he's aroused right there's all kinds of basic stuff about the opposite gender that we don't really know so today we're going to teach y'all about that because it will help you you a lot okay so let's start by understanding the female menstrual cycle so women have ovaries and men have testicles these are both called gonads okay so gonad is the the non-binary term for like the sex hormone producing part of our body so women's ovaries are situated kind of outside of their uterus so if you look at the the anatomy of a woman right so there's a vagina and then there's a cervix and then beyond the cervix there's a uterus and then the uterus has these two things called Fallopian tubes and then the Fallopian tubes sit right next to these things called the ovaries which are the female equivalent of testicles in ovaries you have a bunch of eggs so basically what happens in the female menstrual cycle is we've got two phases one is called the follicular phase which is when an egg is developing or a follicle is developing and then you've got something called the ovulatory phase which is when the a woman enters ovulation which if you don't even know what that is we're gonna explain that so in the ovaries there are these little things called follicles and then the follicle kind of supports an egg when women ovulate what happens is the egg kind of spits out of the follicle and is prepared to be fertilized so the menstrual cycle is usually divided into 28 days and the first 14 days are the follicular phase which is when we're sort of getting ready to be pregnant and then once the egg is ready we enter ovulation which is when the follicle spits out the egg and then there's a window of about three to five days leading up to ovulation and through ovulation where a woman can get pregnant and if a woman is not pregnant during that time it doesn't become pregnant then what happens is they enter into the phase of menstruation so let's talk a little bit about the female menstrual cycle so we have to understand there are two things going on during the female menstrual cycle the first is that we are preparing an egg and by we I mean women for fertilization and the second is we are preparing the uterus for a pregnancy so these are two separate things right so if we've got a fertilized egg it needs some place to hang out and grow into an embryo a fetus and eventually a child so these are two things that are kind of going on so we're going to first talk about egg preparation so in the ovaries we have these little guys called follicles and for the first 14 days of the menstrual cycle this is called the follicular phase where these follicles are being prepared and basically the ovary selects one follicle which has one egg and then once that egg is kind of primed and ready it spits the egg out and then for a period of about 24 hours that egg can be fertilized if it gets fertilized in that time then what happens is it implants into the wall of the uterus and basically during the follicular phase the the walls of the uterus are growing and growing in what way they're sort of getting vascularized which means that if there's a new human being that's going to be growing there or any animal if it's going to be growing there we need a lot of blood flow to the embryo so during this 14 days that the egg is getting ready the uterus is actually building up a bunch of tissue to prepare for pregnancy okay now if there is no fertilization of the egg or the Egg doesn't implant then the uterus is like hey we built up all this like vascular tissue we don't need this anymore and that then it induces menstruation and what menstruation is is we're shedding the the wall the lining of the walls of the uterus so we built up all this vascular tissue that can literally sustain a new life and now we don't need it anymore so we're going to get rid of it and that's what that menstrual blood is so let's understand a couple of things first the first is the average amount of volume in menstruation is about two tablespoons or 30 to 40 CC's this is it this is all the blood there is I don't know why dudes get so scared this is a small quantity of blood this is not very much right but since it's menstrual blood oh my god let's get terrified it's 30 to 40 CC's for the average woman second thing we have to understand is that there's really only a three to five day window where a woman can get pregnant if they have a normal menstrual cycle so remember that after ovulation so ovulation is when the follicle spits out the egg there's a 24-hour window before the egg kind of falls apart maybe 36 but the key thing to remember this is where nature tricks you is that sperm can stay alive in the uterus for a couple days before that so there's really only a three to five day window every month where if a woman has a normal menstrual cycle she can get pregnant and so as we talk about birth control that's something that's really important to remember okay so just to summarize menstrual cycles first of all are not scary it's okay it's a normal cycle it has 14 days of the follicular phase then we spit the egg out if the egg gets fertilized implants into the uterus and we're on to pregnancy but if it doesn't implant in the uterus there's some stuff that happens in over the course of the next 14 days that's it kind of everything kind of winds down and then we sort of end up with menstruation okay so now let's talk a little bit about birth control so what we're going to do is review a lot of different types of birth control sort of what the efficacy is and considerations for when you should use each one so the first thing that we're going to talk about is we're going to define efficacy so what do we mean by efficacy of birth control so all of the studies on birth control look at people who are using a particular method for one year and what is the chance they end up pregnant or not pregnant if you're using that method of birth control for one year so for example when people say condoms are 90 effective what does that mean that means that if people are having sex using condoms for the period of one year ninety percent of them will not get pregnant ten percent of them will it does not mean that a single usage of a condom means that there's a 10 chance you're not rolling the dice with a 10 chance that someone gets pregnant and now it sort of makes sense because if we understand the menstrual cycle and women can only get pregnant three to five days out of the month if they have normal menstrual cycles and then we're using a condom and sometimes condoms grow up all that stuff has to align in order for someone to get pregnant okay so efficacy is using that birth control over the period of one year what are the chances that it prevents pregnancy so let's talk a minute about condoms so condoms are special they're very special and very unique from other levels of birth control for a couple of reasons the first is that they're generally speaking one of the only methods of birth control that can prevent STIs so this is really important because when we have sex they're usually two things that we're trying to avoid one is we're trying to avoid pregnancy unless you're trying to get pregnant which is totally cool and we're trying to avoid the transmission of sexually transmitted diseases okay so the condom is really the only one that can prevent STIs so if you are concerned about getting an STI or you're having sex with someone and you don't know what their sexual history is you don't know what kind of you know Partners they've had or or how sexually they active they are with other people it's probably a good idea to use a condom so this is where even if you're on birth control as a woman it may be a good idea to use a condom anyway if you're concerned at all about STIs so let's talk for a second about STIs generally speaking there are two kinds of STIs there are viral infections and bacterial infections so bacterial infections thankfully we can treat really really well now so there used to be old infections like syphilis like back in the day that would cause all kinds of problems they can damage your spinal cord get into your brain over time and cause all kinds of you know brain damage and stuff like that but generally speaking we can give people antibiotics to treat things like syphilis gonorrhea chlamydia you take coarse antibiotics and you're actually like cured of the STI which is why it's really really important that if something is happening with your junk whether you're a dude or a woman or something in between if you've got like a sore or something nasty down there or a vesicle or a rash you need to go see a doctor right away and why is that well because a lot of times when something goes wrong with your body especially if it's junk you don't want to show anyone you're just going to cross your fingers and hopes it goes away and this is the thing your immune system's pretty good so after a week it may go away like it may actually do that because our immune system is pretty good the problem is that a lot of these infections can be dormant for some amount of time and then can cause damage long term so if you ever see something going on with your junk you should absolutely go see a doctor okay second kind of infection you can get is called a viral infection so viral infections are a little bit trickier because we don't have great treatments that will eradicate them so good examples of viral infections are HIV which is essentially a lifelong diagnosis things like herpes viruses and other very common viral infection which somewhere between by the way 25 and 40 of the population has okay so herpes will kind of stick with you basically lifelong the good news is that even with viral infections we're pretty good at treating them so for herpes for example the severity and frequency of outbreaks tends to go down over time most people actually not most but you know 25 to 40 percent of people have it and and it's not like ruining lives right left and center the other thing is HIV now has a normal life expectancy we've got really good treatments for HIV now there's also something that's really important to understand is if you are having sex with someone and it's kind of a high risk situation the condom breaks or you don't use a condom even if you've had sex we now have something called post-exposure prophylaxis which means if you have sex with someone without a condom who may be HIV positive you can actually start taking retroviral medication after the sex like 24 hours later and it can actually prevent HIV infection so if you're concerned at all about viral infections you should absolutely once again go see a doctor okay the third thing that we're going to add which is a little bit of a caveat is not everything going on with your junk is a sexually transmitted infection so I've seen some relationship ships get really really messed up through this but let's say someone ends up with a rash their partner ends up with a rash everyone assumes it's sexually transmitted but there are all kinds of other infections that aren't transmitted via sex that can happen to your junk so one example is if the pH in the vagina changes you can start to get fungal infections in there there are some medications that will induce you know fungal infections with penises or vaginas or things like that so not everything that is not all infections of the junk is necessarily sexually transmitted bacterial vaginosis is another good example of that okay so you can still get it treated right so it's it you should absolutely get it treated but just because you have an infection of your junk doesn't mean that you necessarily got it from a partner that's why you should once again go do what see a doctor very good okay so that's condoms from birth control standpoint condoms are about 90 effective so if you don't want to use condoms now we kind of move into predominantly female methods of birth control so the most common female method of birth control is probably the pill okay so how does the pill work remember now that you all understood the female menstrual cycle so remember that the follicle grows and then spits out the egg so how does female birth control work female birth control works by altering hormones so that we pres prevent that ovulation and follicular development okay depending on what kind of birth control you use things can be a little bit different about what part of the cycle it targets but essentially if there's never an egg that gets ovulated out no one can ever get pregnant so what we can do is add levels of estrogen and progesterone which you kind of take on a regular basis and depending on what combination you take it'll sort of prevent a different part of that menstrual cycle this is where it's important to remember that different kinds of birth control can be right for different sorts of people so this is where it's also important for dudes to understand that even though you're taking a pill every day a lot of these birth controls can be very unpleasant so you're taking hormones like estrogen and progesterone which can lead to things like more minor stuff which can be very not Minor by the way like bloating or cramps which are very unpleasant and they can eat birth control can even do things like cause strokes and blood clots so also PSA if you're on birth control and smoking you should really not be on that combination and talk to a doctor about it drastically increases your risk of stroke and blood clots so birth control there are a couple of different kinds if a particular kind of birth control is not working um you know you can try to take a different formulation that has different hormonal balances generally speaking uh oral contraceptive pills are somewhere between 95 and 98 effective and why is that so why aren't they 100 effective or 99 effective it's because oftentimes human beings will forget to take pills so there's a certain amount of human error but basically somewhere between two and five percent of people who are in oral contraceptive pills can end up pregnant so moving on Beyond oral contraceptive pills the next thing um which I think is a really fantastic form of birth control is something called an IUD so an IUD is an intrauterine device so remember that the egg gets spit spit out gets fertilized by a sperm and then that embryo has to implant into the wall of the uterus to create pregnancy so what an intrauterine devices is it's something that is implanted into the uterus through the vagina through the cervix and into the uterus so it usually doesn't interfere with sex because sex is in the vagina okay what it essentially does is creates a minor inflammatory environment or it releases a local hormone like progesterone which is just affects the uterus that prevents pregnancy so the cool thing about intrauterine devices is even though we can use hormonal contraception there aren't systemic effects you won't end up with bloating or cramping or headaches or other kinds of problems because instead of hormones flooding all through your body because you're taking a pill right when I take a pill goes to my stomach distributes all through my body there's a localized effect in the uterus that will prevent pregnancy so the cool thing about iuds is they tend to be 99 effective um and basically they you know it's very hard to get pregnant on IUD because they're very well designed and why is it quote unquote Superior to oral contraceptive pills it's because you don't have to worry about remembering to take your medication every day you can leave an IUD in the uterus for five years or even longer so it's like a you know one-time thing that you can kind of do if you're not planning on getting pregnant anytime soon you can get it changed out every five years and so it's kind of like a good solution if you're pretty sure you're not going to be pregnant anytime soon or don't want to be pregnant so there are a couple of other methods to deliver hormones and essentially and have the same effect as oral contraceptive pills so there are hormonal they're both controlled patches so this is something that you slap on maybe once a month right so instead of taking a pill every day you can just slap on a patch um and and they work similar to oral contraceptive pills it's hormonal in nature they're also shots that you can get either monthly or every three months that will also prevent pregnancy you get a shot sort of does something to your hormone levels and there are even things called other implants where people can you know put a like a little implant subdermally so right under the skin that slowly trickles out hormone hormones that will prevent pregnancy all three of these things tend to be comparably effective we're probably talking about somewhere around 98 efficacy and then there's the last form of birth control which also tends to be somewhat drastic or permanent which is that you can get a vasectomy if you're a dude right so if you're 100 sure that you're done having kids you can get a vasectomy and what is a vasectomy so we have our testicles and then we have our penis right so what happens is our penis is where the ejaculate comes from and the testicles is where the sperm comes from so somehow the sperm has to get from the testicles to the penis and it usually does that through these these tubes called the vas deferens and if we snip those tubes what happens is the sperm can never get to the actual semen and so you're shooting blanks so this is usually close to a hundred percent effective some people will talk about vasectomy reversals just FYI vasectomy reversals are not very effective so I think there's something like 60 effective if you do them within a year or two so if you wait a couple of years after getting a vasectomy you may not be able to have kids naturally okay so it's sort of a permanent birth control solution it's a surgical option for men for women there are a couple of different things that you can do one is in the most drastic cases some women will have hysterectomies usually they have hysterectomy which is a removal of the uterus by the way um usually for medical reasons so someone's got like uterine cancer or something like that you can just remove the whole uterus the other thing that you can do is remember that they're the ovaries and there's the Fallopian tubes and the Egg travels down the fallopian tube into the uterus you can get your tubes tied which is when you sort of sever or tie those Fallopian tubes that the egg can never reach the uterus and can never get fertilized that's another surgical option for women so these are drastic that are basically kind of 100 percent permanent sort of things um methods of birth control so hopefully at this point I know I've tossed a lot of information at y'all but I do think it's really important for men to understand female birth control and why is that it's because most of the options are actually like available to women right and we as men need to first of all not be afraid of the period it's not a terrifying thing and you know women have them every month and it's not it doesn't invoke Satan or anything like that it's just women have periods it's a normal part of their physiology we should also understand as men like a little bit about things like STIs and stuff like that and by the way if you're a woman and you didn't understand this stuff because you grew up in a household where people didn't want to teach you about birth control fantastic right so that's great too so remember that condoms are really the only effective protection against STIs there are some female condom equivalents which basically don't get used very much but condoms are about 90 effective I think uh IEDs tend to work really really well if you don't want to get pregnant for a long period of time if you are on a hormonal based birth control is a dude you need to understand that those don't come without side effects so oftentimes the reason that women are reluctant to take birth control is because it makes them feel like crap and so that's something that is a long-term conversation hopefully between you and your partner about condom use and other things like that and most of all I want all y'all man woman everything in between to stay safe and don't get pregnant unless you want to get pregnant so if you've got a uterus or ovaries I don't care what you identify as if you've got a uterus and ovaries in your menstrual if you're ovulating then you can get pregnant right so just remember that so everyone should act accordingly and hopefully this information has helped you all to stay sexually safe sexually healthy and not wind up with unnecessary pregnancies
