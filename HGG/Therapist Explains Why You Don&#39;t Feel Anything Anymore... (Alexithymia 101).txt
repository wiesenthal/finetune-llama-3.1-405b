attachment is how we learn what we feel on the inside so a child early on doesn't know what they're feeling right so if I'm an 18 month old and I'm walking around and I Stumble and fall do I feel hurt should I panic or should I laugh and if the adults in the room are terrified oh my God little Timmy fell down then the child starts crying he's like oh crap today what we're going to talk about is Alexa thymia so Alexa thyme is the inability to experience your internal emotional state and what I kind of view this as is almost like an emotional color blindness so a lot of times what we don't really realize but a lot of our problems actually come from an inability to experience our internal emotional state we're not really aware of what we're feeling on the inside and there's actually a lot of science that shows that being unaware of what you're feeling can lead to all kinds of problems so alexithymia has been associated with problems with motivation and finding direction and purpose in life so so if you're someone who kind of like is going through life but you're not really sure you know what's the point like you don't know why you're on this Earth You don't really like you look around at other people and you see like oh these people are so motivated like they get up every day and they're striving for something but I get up every day and it's just kind of like a haze right I don't know really why I'm here I'm just sort of existing instead of living and that's actually been tied to alexithymia we also find that Alexa thymia is a common culprit in a lot of psychological problems so leads to problems or not leads to but exacerbates problems like addiction so people who are Lexa thymic are more prone to addiction will even dive into a lot of my clinical experience with working with people with addiction which I don't know if you all have struggled with this yourself or maybe you have a friend who will say yeah I was doing great I was like sober for six months and then I don't know what happened I just relapsed one day and it was out of the blue but what you'll really discover when you work with those people is it really wasn't out of the blue and what was actually going on is that there were slight emotional stressors that were building up over time building up over time building up over time this really good Neuroscience to support this and then when those stressors got overwhelming the person ended up relapsing and remember that these people are colorblind to this which is why they don't really they're not aware of it they think everything is fine even though problems are building in the background and Alexa thyme is also a culprit for problems in relationships so what we tend to find is that when we don't understand what we're feeling it creates all kinds of stresses in relationships we start to send mixed signals because someone asks us hey is it okay if I you know go to this party without you and you're like yeah it's fine like whatever and then you kind of feel resentful but you don't know how to vocalize that resentment you feel ashamed for feeling that resentment and so as a result it kind of sabotages your relationship because you said it was okay but now you're punishing this person for something that you gave them permission for so lexithiamia has been associated with all these kinds of things and what I'd love to do is dive into really what alexithymia is today as well as a little bit about how it manifests in different dimensions and in our lives okay so something else cool to show y'all so a couple months maybe a month ago we looked at a very popular Psychology today article where there was a psychologist who was talking about how men are struggling and dating and what they need to do is become more emotionally available I think the article is really useful in a lot of way made a lot of good points but I think the challenge is you can say like okay like people need to be more emotionally available my question is how how do you learn to be emotionally available can you go sign up for emotional availability class everyone is saying the world needs to be a particular place or gen Z needs to stop being so entitled or this quiet quitting is a problem or men need to be emotionally available and so as the emphasis on emotional awareness increases we've got events like right in the fields right in the fields is all about helping you understand your emotions grazing awareness of emotions hopefully helping you regulate your emotions so that you can kind of boost your EQ a little bit so I'd love to share with you all what we've discovered so far so here is our right in the fields of motion tracking I just wanted to share this with you all today so the most common emotion that we feel in our community is actually happiness which is something that you sometimes wouldn't get you look sometimes at our community and it's like oh man like people are like struggling so much but actually this is what's cool is like a lot of people are happy a lot of people are building their lives and starting to be happy it's like awesome that happiness is actually the number one winner now there may be some kind of selection bias here and this is something I encourage you all to think about for people who are participating in the event I think there's a greater likelihood that those people will be happy now we have to be careful here because are they if I'm happy does that mean I'm more more likely to participate in stuff maybe but I think there's another subtle Association here which is it's people who participate in stuff like this that actually improve their emotions the likelihood to participate in activities that help you understand your emotional awareness the kind of people who will sign up for this are the kinds of people who have done other stuff because they're more likely to sign up and as you do more stuff you will become more happy so out of the first 4 000 people how many of them did touch grass there's probably a really high overlap in fact it's probably the people who did touch grass and really improved from it that are signing up for this too because they're like wow that was so awesome and so the key thing here is that I don't think that happiness necessarily makes you sign up but the more likely you are to sign up for something and engage with something the more likely you are to actually wind up being more happy so other stuff so what is right in the fields so it's a challenge to help you identify the emotions you struggle with and build emotional awareness over six weeks so we're going to start by identifying simple emotions identifying complex emotions identifying obscure emotions recognizing intensity participate in emotional regulation and do emotional reflection and we're going to focus on six emotions over six weeks shame fear boredom anger sadness and happiness hold on a second are you saying that boredom is an emotion and of course in order to encourage participation we're gonna bribe y'all because that's what we have to do is there are rewards Discord events um that we're going to be talking about and so check it out so let's take a look so let's talk about alexithymia okay so alexithymia is the inability to detect internal emotional state alexithymia has been associated with motivational problems we've already said purpose has been associated with addictions and other mental health problems right and these are not just um diagnosed addictions but also like digital addictions like YouTube and Tick Tock and stuff like that and then lastly relationship problems now here's why talking about Alexa thyme is important a lot of people who struggle with these three things will go looking for answers for these three things right does that make sense we're looking for answers so they'll say how do I find purpose in life and what people will do is give them answers about purpose so we'll say like oh like go read inspiring things or like go out and volunteer and go do this and go do this and go do this and go do this and they don't realize that the prop that what's really in the way is actually emotional color blindness because when when you ask someone like if I Google like how do I find purpose in life you're not going to see alexithymia or emotional colorblindness come up how do I overcome addictions you're not going to see Alexa timeia come up I have problems in my relationship I I encourage y'all go look at like you know any kind of relationship advice situation like go look at like a subreddit or a forum or whatever no one is going to say hey the problem with this relationship is that you're emotionally colorblind right what they're going to do is they're gonna say oh like this person doesn't respect your boundaries break up with them and as it turns out there's actually good scientific evidence that all of these things are influenced by alexithymia so let's take a look look at what are the components of alexithymia okay so number one is difficulty identifying feelings okay and now we're going to see so number two is difficulty describing feelings to others right you'll see maybe how this can relate to relationship problems if I can't describe what I'm feeling number three is y'all ready for this this is going to be a KO okay stimulus bound externally oriented thinking Style now you may say what does this mean Dr K this means that in order for you to be motivated to do something there must be a stimulus from the outside that causes your motivation an externally oriented thinking style means that you need external deadlines pressure these are both stimuli right do you all get that in order to act now that's kind of interesting because this seems like a huge problem right I can't bring myself to do something until there's some kind of consequence or deadline I'm like externally motivated and it turns out that being externally motivated is correlated and is one of the features of being internally colorblind which sort of makes sense right because if I'm blind to my internal drivers I'm going to need to rely on external deadlines and pressures and things like that in order to act the last thing that's kind of interesting is a constricted imagination and you may say well wait a second what does imagination have to do with internal colorblindness so there are studies that show that literally people who have alexithymia will have more logical and like less emotive dreams so they'll have dreams that are like really kind of run-of-the-mill kind of like emotionally Bland kind of stuff and what I've seen when I work with people who are Alexa thymic is I'll ask them one really important question I'll ask them where do you want to be in five years and when I ask this you know where do you want to be in five years question people who are lexithymic are like I have no idea I can't even imagine it they can very much vocalize I don't like that I'm living at home I don't like that I'm alone I don't like and they'll use these words like like or don't like right they won't say I'm ashamed of living at home I feel pathetic about myself they'll say yeah I don't want this this needs to change needs to change and then the problem that we get into is that remember they're stimulus bound so even though it needs to change if your parents aren't kicking you out of their basement then you're never going to leave and so they have difficulty Imagining the future and by the way difficulty Imagining the future leads to a lack of purpose because if we think about those people that we want to be like right who have purpose and are driven for something can devote 20 years of their life to create a dream but if you can't even imagine what the future would be like how are you supposed to have visions to go towards how are you supposed to find goals and what we end up doing when we're alexathymic is since we don't we're not in touch with ourselves what we end up doing is just looking at external sources for inspiration so we end up with this kind of bland materialism where we look around and we're like I don't really want this but I guess it would be nice I should move out of the house I should get in shape I should start eating healthy I should start making more money because we like look at all these things but we don't have this internal driver we're stimulus bound and so we just kind of like look outside of ourselves and we're like okay I guess I should do that because that looks good okay so these are the four features of Alexa timeia and as we'll see we're going to break down how these already how these lead to these three common problems so let's talk a little bit about the origins of alexithymia so how does someone become Alexa thymic so the first thing to understand is that there's alexithymia is more often found in men than in women so there's even something called um I forget the exact uh yeah normative male alexithymia so let's talk about normative male alexithymia for a second so what do we mean by normative male alexithymia what we mean is that researchers have sort of found that a certain amount of alexithymia is normal in men and why is this so if you look at how men are sort of culturally raised we're really raised to express one emotion so frustration or anger that's really the only thing that you're allowed to feel as a man growing up this is sort of changing now thankfully but I just saw a social media clip about you know how men shouldn't cry from a conservative commentator but so this is kind of normal where we're sort of taught like you know if you think about like you know a 13 year old kid who's playing sports and they they feel afraid to go to the big match and when they feel fear what are they taught or is that an acceptable emotion no fear is something that needs to be conquered fear is for the weak and heaven forbid you feel ashamed right because like crying and feeling shame like those aren't acceptable emotions those are also emotions of weakness what are the emotions that a strong man feels a strong man feels anger righteousness right and what I really find is that for a lot of men that I've worked with and we'll get to women in a second because things are changing very rapidly is that anger sort of forms an umbrella emotion so I'll give you all kind of a simple example okay so let's say I get rejected by someone that I'm interested in let's assume a heteronormative relationship between a man and a woman so when I feel rejected by someone there are all kinds of things that normally come with rejection right so there could be fear that I'll be alone forever shame at myself for being rejected feelings of low self-worth but is that what I say do I go to my friends and I say hey this per I asked this person out they turn me down and now I'm afraid that I don't have the basic qualities necessary for being in a relationship I'm afraid of being alone for the rest of my life you know like I'm just really scared about what this means for my future that's not how we talk right instead what you tend to see is what what it's a lot of considered toxic uh masculinity which is like oh yeah like she dumped me like screw her and then my friends will also say yeah like you deserve better right and that what they'll kind of do is they'll like they'll kind of ramp me up and this is just true of man this absolutely happens with women as well where people will say yeah you dodged a bullet oh yeah that person doesn't deserve you and they'll take all those fears and shames and loneliness and what they'll do is they'll like replace them with anger screw screw that person they'll get mad at this person for hurting you and so it's very easy for anger to become the umbrella emotion that's the thing that we're kind of normalized to feel a couple of other uh considerations here is that in my opinion this is changing rapidly and I've seen more women who are Alexa thymic in the last you know if we look at like when I started med school in 2010 I'd say the nature of alexithymia and the discrepancy between men and women is shrinking so there's good evidence that a lot of women are alexithymic as well so for example if we look at anorexia nervosa so this is a diagnosis that predominantly affects women 63 percent of people with anorexia nervosa will be Alexa thymic okay 50 of people with major depressive disorder will be alexithymic about probably less than 10 percent of the population is severely alexithymic which is pretty big and then like probably you know up to 30 to 50 percent of the population is moderately or mildly electronic I'm not entirely sure about that number and so what we're seeing is that this is probably changing rapidly why is it changing rapidly so the first is that there's some good news which is that men are getting more in touch with our their emotions that's something that you know we try to do here and other people are trying to do as well I think um women especially are starting to recognize that men have difficulty with emotions so thank you you for your support the other thing that's happening with Alexa thyme is increasing technology use and this isn't gender specific and what we see with increasing technology use is that using any kind of social media or video game suppresses our emotional circuitry like the limbic system so this is like the amygdala to a certain degree the hippocampus couple of other areas and so what happens is if we spend eight hours a day using technology those are eight hours of the day where our emotional circuitry is being suppressed and as our emotional circuitry enters this chronic state of suppression and more importantly as it gets suppressed during periods of critical development so if I'm a teenager and I feel really bad about myself normally like so a lot of teenagers feel bad about themselves and to a certain degree we can't escape those feelings so we are by definition forced to deal with them right so I'm moping around the house my parents notice something is wrong they try to talk to him about it I reject them I go hang out with my friends this is kind of when I was growing up when I was a teenager like back in the 90s right and there was a certain amount of like emotions I couldn't escape from I started falling into a video game addiction because that's when I started to escape from my emotions and now what we're seeing is a generation of kids kids who have a very very very easy escape from their emotions and as we have escapes from our emotions we don't develop them we don't develop our internal understanding of them so as technology use is increasing we're seeing that normative male lexithymia is starting to actually get balanced out and I think a lot of women I'd say women now are more alexithymic compared to Men I'm not saying they're more than men but the Gap seems to be shrinking with technology use okay so the internet is essentially dulling our emotions so as our emotions get dulled what kind of problems does this create so the first is let's talk about purpose and motivation hey chat subscribing to our YouTube channel allows us to help more people with their mental health thanks to your support so far we've already reached thousands of people from across the globe so help us out and hit subscribe wait they have to hit subscribe and click a bell now let me ask you all a question how do you find purpose in life so like how do you find it do you go outside walking down the street and then you find it do you Google your way to an answer do you randomly go and volunteer until you discover purpose in your life that's not that doesn't really work right so I don't know how to say this but purpose comes from inspiration and what do we what do we mean by purpose comes from inspiration it's kind of like if you find my purpose my purpose doesn't come from outside of me it comes from within me and what I've seen more and more in our society is that we've got when people have difficulty finding purpose what I tend to see is that their internal voice has been squashed so I'll see this a lot with controlling parents for example so parents who will say like I don't care what you want you need to do what I tell you to do we see a lot of gifted kids who struggle with finding purpose and I think one of the middle connecting pieces is actually alexithymia because these are kids whose potential was realized right that or noticed by their parents and their parents were like oh you're too smart to do ABC forget what your internal voice is I don't want you to spend time in art class I want you to go you know be an entrepreneur Tech genius at the age of 19. and so a lot of times what we're seeing is that people have difficulty finding purpose because those internal voices were squashed by controlling parents we also tend to find that people who have difficulty finding purpose were also neglected or dealt with some a kind of abuse or had Early Childhood experiences or poor attachment formation so remember that attachment is how we form human relationships and the attachment Theory also teaches us or attachment is how we learn what we feel on the inside so a child early on doesn't know what they're feeling right so if I'm an 18 month old and I'm walking around and I Stumble and fall do I feel hurt should I panic or should I laugh and if you look at an 18 year old who stumbles and Falls the first thing that they're going to do is look to the adults in the room and if the adults in the room are terrified oh my God little Timmy fell down then the child starts crying he's like oh crap I should be worried right now everyone else is worried and so then a child learns to that they learn to recognize their feelings by looking at the faces of others similarly if that same child turns to everyone else and everyone else starts laughing then the child will start laughing too and they'll be like oh this is funny and so what ends up happening is if we grow up in neglectful households so we're not talking necessarily about abuse but even if you you have a parent single parent household who works two jobs and they're not around to reflect your emotions back to you what we discover is that these kids grow up to be Alexa time and as they grow to be Alexa thymic they struggle because they don't know how to look into themselves and as they don't as they don't know how to look into themselves they can't find purpose and what they end up doing is looking outside of themselves for some kind of compass or goal to move towards I have no idea what I want in my life if you ask me so now we can kind of go back to some of our data right so if we kind of go back to this if you ask me what I want I have constricted imagination I have no idea what I want what I want is to have purpose what I want is to no longer live this life I want this life to change that's what they want this is also where you see people who are externally motivated and why are they externally motivated because they're colorblind to themselves because remember what is the relationship between emotion and motivation if we want to understand this go watch a movie any movie doesn't matter what the movie is when there's a protagonist hero or heroine what motivates them to overcome to Triumph against adversity dig really deep and beat that final boss is it logic when the hero is losing or heroin is losing in that critical period comes do they go to the library and do the next four hours of the movie show them doing exhaustive research in logical mathematical proofs to discover the solution and then they hand or Treatise about how the villain is being a bad person to them that is logically perfect and then the then they show that the the villain is flipping through the pages and then realizes logically I'm defeated and then the movie ends no you never see people furiously reading things on Wikipedia and listening to podcasts in order to triumph over adversity and find motivation to keep going right what do you see emotions and if you think about the periods of your life where you've been the most motivated chances are emotions have something to do with it all those moments of life where you're like never again I'm never gonna be in this situation again or you feel inspired to create right is that like logically you're like oh I guess I should do this no you feel inspiration and how are you supposed to feel inspiration if you're emotionally colorblind there's a lot of good evidence to support this as well so we know that the amygdala which is our fear Center is really good at putting the brakes on our frontal lobes it can just shut them straight off so our frontal lobes are responsible for our executive function which is planning and executing tasks so we can wake up this morning and say okay I've got this to-do list and I've got 14 things to do and our amygdala is like yeah we're afraid to leave in the house we're not going to do that today and you're like all right well I guess I'm not going to do anything today but you don't realize it because now the problem with Alexa thyme is you're blind to this component so what do these people actually experience they experience a motivation I'm just not motivated to do anything they don't see the emotions holding them back because what keeps us from acting negative emotions fear of Shame fear of rejection fear so purpose and motivation are absolutely tied to alexithymia next up let's talk about addictions so there's evidence that shows people who relapse are emotionally unaware so if you look at when people use the more that someone is able to identify what they are feeling in the moment the less likely they are to use a substance so for example this is why a uses call your sponsor if you're struggling right let's think about that why should you call your sponsor if you're struggling when you call your sponsor first of all let's understand what struggling means what is the experience of struggling feeling negative emotions why don't we say call your sponsor if you're feeling negative emotions why do we use the word struggling because we're Alexa thymic and we don't even know what these are so all we experience is the struggle do you all see that our experience of it is just that life is hard because we don't even know that struggling struggling is not a real thing it's an umbrella term what a struggle like what does it mean to strong things are hard well what does that mean it's hard for me to do something well okay what makes it hard well I'm terrified of asking my boss for a raise because I don't want to be perceived as greedy okay now we see that there's potential for shame now we see that there's fear now we see that there's anxiety but what we do when we're alexithymic is we just say I'm struggling bro I'm struggling and I've seen this clinically a lot where I'll like work with people and I'll ask them I'll be like hey so like you know you were sober for six months what happened they'll say I don't know what happened I just relapsed I was good one day and then suddenly I wasn't good it just happened and the more that I tunnel down out with those people I don't know if you all have friends who have struggled with addiction or you yourself have struggled with addiction and I don't know how to say this but like if RNG is responsible for whether you you stay sober or not like that's not a winning strategy right because when someone says it just happened that's RNG there's nothing you can do like if it just happened what can you do to overcome it you can't do anything oh I guess just in the future just make sure it doesn't happen again well how so the more that I work with those people what we actually tunnel down into is it didn't just happen there was a slow burn of negative emotion that reached a certain Tipping Point was overwhelming and you didn't know how to cope because here's the common element of all addictions what is the one thing that unifies all addictions emotional coping the one thing right so whether I'm shooting up heroin or I'm addicted to shopping what they do is manipulate my emotions so any substance will kind of mellow you out or maybe activate you right make help you feel good sometimes that's Euphoria but other kinds of Behavioral addictions like technology addictions they dull our emotional circuitry and so as we dull our emotional circuitry this is really important to understand it doesn't make the emotions go away we just lose sight of it and as we lose sight of it it starts to act in other dimensions of our life it always seeps out that emotional energy is there in the brain it just affects different parts of our brain in different ways just because I'm unaware of the activity of amygdala does not mean that the amygdala does not interfere with my frontal lobes doesn't mean that I don't feel fear and it keeps me trapped at home right so the effects on the brain are absolutely there we just aren't aware of them so we see with alexithymia is that people who are addicted there's actually excellent research on this by Dr volkau volkau I don't know how to pronounce it but she's awesome neuroscientist who talks about the neurobiology of addiction and she actually has isolated that they're like particular emotional circuits in the brain that as we raise awareness of our emotions or we look at people who are how are the brains of people who are addicted different from the brains of people who aren't and there's one of the major benefits sorry one of the major differences is that people who are vulnerable to addiction have a lower level of emotional awareness and literally their brains are wired in a different way so what we tend to find is that people who are not aware of their emotions can't manage them so this is where like here's the tricky thing so if I'm not aware that my negative emotions are building up how am I supposed to healthily cope with them right because the goal of overcoming an addiction is you have to develop healthy coping mechanisms fantastic let's develop healthy coping let's meditate but if I'm not even aware that I'm feeling anxious like I'm not even going to bother to meditate does that make sense so in order to develop healthy coping mechanisms we have to know when we need to cope in a healthy Manner and if we're laxatimic we don't even realize it so let's move on now we get into some real problems okay so here's what we tend to find in people who are Lexa thymic and what their relationships look like oftentimes they are cold and distant when it comes to communication so in their relationships they like feel distant so this is what we would call emotional unavailability I'm looking for someone who's emotionally available that's someone who is not cold and distant let's think about what the opposite is right so warm and present this equals emotional availability and I want you all to think a little bit about okay if you're cold and distant in a relationship think about your parents right where your parents warm and present or were they cold and distant a second feature if you look at the science of alexithymia and look at if you take people who are Lexa thymic and look at what else what other communication patterns do you see the other thing y'all are gonna love this social non-assertive communication so sometimes this is social anxiety or we call this social anxiety I'm not saying that they have a social anxiety disorder what I'm saying is that people who are socially non-assertive with communication have difficulty walking up to someone and initiating conversation they have difficulty advocating for themselves right they're non-assertive in their communication style so they're passive so this is the person who will go to a party and will stand there in the corner and wait for someone to talk to them and we call that social anxiety but this is actually associated with alexithymia okay next thing this is the beta mindset right so I'm going to draw a pretty broad correlation here I'm not saying that this is real but what I'm saying is if you listen to people who talk about being betas or get called betas they're non-assertive communicators right so that they're people who will like have lots of feelings but then like won't go and ask someone out so I I think I know it sounds kind of weird but I think a lot of like people like this you don't have to go and take the red pill and become an ultra chat or things like that what you actually just need to do is be aware of what your what Your internal emotional state is and as you become more aware of your internal emotional state you can start to be more assertive in communication and this is where if you look at some of like this community right they're all about assertive communication I think sometimes their assertiveness crosses the the you know the bridge into toxicity and being harmful but I think that like this is the kind of interesting thing about that communities I think they've stumbled on a lot of good stuff but I think they're they're underlying mechanisms are not scientifically based because what you actually discover is that as you become come less alexithymic we're not saying that you need to be a better person you just need to be aware of what you're feeling on on the inside and as you become aware of what you're feeling on the inside you can start to communicate more assertively so this is also there's some really interesting data here to understand about relationships which is that if you look at men men will oftentimes be reluctant to engage in couples counseling there's research on this and if you ask men why why don't you want to go to couples therapy or why are men resistant to couples therapy what it actually comes down to is that men feel like they are at a disadvantage in terms of participating in couples therapy and why is that it's because they don't know how to describe they can't describe their feelings to other people and so what happens is they go into couples therapy and then they have a partner who's very emotionally descriptive and then they feel like their partner does such a better job at explaining themselves that the therapist takes their side and then when the therapist asks okay what's your experience of this the dude is like I don't know right so Men actually feel like they're at a disadvantage when it comes to therapy now I'm not saying that men are at a disadvantage that's a really really important thing to consider so when I work with men for example in couples therapy what I oftentimes find is that if I have an Alexa thymic patient man or a woman right because a lot of women can be alexithymic too it's my job as the couple's therapist to translate this into I'm afraid I'm ashamed so I don't think that men are actually at a disadvantage in couples therapy for the record they just feel that way which leads to their reluctance to engage and then let's try to think through so if you can't communicate your emotions if you don't know what you feel and you can't communicate emotions what is that what happens in a relationship when you can't communicate your emotions well this is where things get hard because what happens is we get into arguments and we get into arguments that are very confusing because the stated reasons that we have don't actually match what we feel so I'll give you all an example so I was once working with a young man who got into a conflict with their significant other and he was concerned because she had a couple of conferences and business trips lined up where there were male colleagues that she would go with right so it was like a group of people from their job so it wasn't just like one one woman and one man but this guy was really really concerned and he was like yeah like you know uh men just want one thing and the the or his partner would say like oh you know these are just my Prof like they're friends of mine from work I'm not romantically interested in them at all they're not romantically interested in me at all we're just friends there's nothing for you to worry about and then the man responds with well like that's just not true all men just want one thing you know they're just biting their time like I I don't want you to go like you know like I don't think it's good you don't understand them and so there's this kind of paranoia that started to come out and sometimes would really result in controlling Behavior right so there's paranoia and controlling Behavior because they're like you don't understand men right I understand men you're in danger I don't want you hanging out with them I don't want you hanging out with them when really what's underneath is fear right so the man isn't able to articulate I feel insecure I'm afraid that I love you so much and I think you're such an amazing person and I have self-esteem problems I don't think I deserve you I think you deserve someone way better than me and so what I'm afraid of is that at some point if you spend time with other men who are better than I am because I have self-esteem issues eventually you will realize that you can do better than me and since I love you and since I care about this relationship I don't ever want that to happen I don't ever want to lose you do you deserve better yes but do I want to hang on to you absolutely and so now what happens is unless the man is able to vocalize that because by the way what kind of shameful crap is that like who says like you like who says that kind of thing how is that chat at all like that's the most beta stuff you could say by the way right which is why we suppress those kinds of thoughts growing up and then we don't know how to articulate them and now we see how this leads to conflict in a relationship because now the discussion is are all men trying to get into your pants no they're not and you guys are arguing up here and then there's no resolution because y'all are each trying to convince each other where the real problem is I feel insecure I'm afraid that you're going to leave me and then the worst part of the situation is because that's the root problem that leads to the paranoia and the controlling Behavior eventually what ends up happening to this person's previous girlfriends they end up leaving because he's so controlling right and you take that to the internet and people like oh my God that guy is so controlling dump him and move on and then like now what's happened now the person has been further traumatized oh my God my self-esteem is so much I deserve I really didn't deserve that people have been leaving me over and over and over again now I really like any decent person deserves better than me and so then the whole cycle repeats and what does it come down to Alexa time you it comes down to inability to understand what you're feeling inability to admit to yourself that you're insecure and sure as hell ain't gonna communicate that to this person that I'm afraid of leaving and so I sabotage myself I shoot myself in the foot and we result in a situation where there you can't communicate with your partner and you end up driving them away because the actual problem in the relationship cannot be discussed or addressed and instead you all end up having 9 rounds on whether all men are trying to get into your pants or not so a lot of what we see is controlling Behavior actually comes from inability to understand and articulate your own feelings now in this example we sort of use the situation of a mandating woman I've absolutely seen it the other way as well right where a lot of controlling Behavior actually comes out of insecurity and so it's not necessarily men to women just just in that direction so what we end up seeing is that alexithymia causes all kinds of problems and when you go look at relationship advice stuff they're not going to say oh yeah the problem here is that you're you know you're emotionally colorblind what people will say is communicate communicate communicate but communicate what right people say communication is the foundation of a healthy relationship but what to communicate what should I say in communication what you should say is be aware of your feelings and communicate your feelings your drives your desires to your partner and so I think that Alexa thymia is a really really common and growing problem we know that less than 10 percent of the population up to 10 of the population has severe alexithymia but we also see that there are high correlations of alexithymia with all kinds of other problems 63 of people with anorexia nervosa have alexithymia we also know that to a certain degree there is normative male alexithymia so there's a certain amount of the way that all men are raised which leads to a certain degree of alexithymia which is sort of really allowing us to feel only one emotion and as we feel predominantly anger we lose sight and don't know how to detect these other emotions as we lose sight of those emotions which by the way technology is increasing is making Alexa thymia worse across the board because the universal effect of technology is to numb our emotional circuitry and especially our negative emotional circuitry so as we have a generation of people who are becoming more internally numb it creates all kinds of problems that we see front and center the first is purpose and motivation I'm so burnt out at work well why are you burnt out at work well I took this job well why did you take the job it's because I had a quiet voice deep inside me that told me that I really want to do this and that voice was first squashed by my parents and then I internalized that dialogue and took all of my hopes and dreams and throttled them and then I ended up picking a job for Prestige and now I call it quiet quitting it starts with Alexa timing so we struggle to find purpose we also know from lots of research that people who are lexithymic have difficulty with their imagination especially around the future we also see a lot of problems that we see with motivation which is that a lot of people will say oh I'm externally motivated I can't do anything unless there's a deadline and this is literally associated with Alexa time it's one of the key four features of alexithymia is to be externally to be externally oriented thinking and stimulus bound which means that you don't act unless there's an external thing that is pushing you to act and let's think about that for a second well why is that well duh it's because you spent the first 20 years of your life turning down the volume on the internal stuff which results in alexithymia I don't know what I'm feeling on the inside and so what are the only things that I'm left to motivate myself with are things from the outside we also see other consequences of this such as a vulnerability towards addiction or worsening of Addicting behaviors there are high correlations between Alexa thymine and all kinds of mental diagnoses so very high correlation with autism spectrum disorders 63 of anorexia which we talked about about 45 percent of binge eating disorders a lot of addictive behaviors up to maybe 50 of people with major depressive disorder will have will be alexithymic as well and so what we're starting to see is that when people get addicted what is what is the purpose of an addiction the purpose of an addiction is emotional coping that's the one uniform thing between all addictions they help us manage our emotions and if I'm colorblind to what I am feeling I cannot develop a healthy coping mechanism because I don't even know that my my trash can is 50 full the only time I notice it is when it's overflowing because that's when it starts to create problems in my life and that's when I end up relapsing the third big Dimension that alexithymia causes problems is within relationships because remember the second core feature of Alexa thyme is difficulty describing your emotional state to others and when I can't articulate how I feel in a relationship I'm sort of at a disadvantage in terms of communication and then I don't know how to tell my partner how I how I feel or even and friends right where like your friends didn't invite you to a party and then like just imagine this for a second like they didn't invite you to a party and you feel hurt and left out do you actually go to them and say hey it was really hurtful to me that y'all left me out I feel neglected and I feel undervalued compared to other friends in our friend group does anyone talk like that maybe increasingly but generally speaking what people will say is there'll be some kind of like weird passive aggressive exchange right I'll be mad at you and be like hey by the way I'm around in the future you don't know how to say that to people or when you do say it because the other person is Alexa that I make and you say hey I feel undervalued compared to other people that makes your friend feel ashamed but they don't realize that they feel ashamed and so what they end up doing is getting mad at you right because they are Alexa thymic too and all they know how to feel is anger so that shame turns into anger and they're like all right bro whatever you're a loser I'm out and that's what the first person is afraid of that they're gonna have a negative reaction so now I can't even articulate my feelings because you've got two alexithymic people which explains so many online relationships where we can't communicate our needs to other people right when you say hey you I feel neglected and undervalued as part of the group and if your friend is not alexithymic they'll recognize oh I feel bad I'm sorry about that it's really hard for me to hear that especially because I've tried to invite you three or four times and I feel like I actually value you more than other people in the relationship here's my perspective that the last three times I've invited you you've declined or you haven't shown up and the reason that I didn't invite you isn't because I value you less it's because I feel rejected when I invite you to things and you don't show up I start to wonder is there something wrong with me that this person doesn't want to hang out with me and then you all like have a conversation about it but if we're alexatheimic on either side let alone both it's going to sabotage our relationship so we tend to see that Alexa thymia causes problems in all three of these dimensions and the real challenge is that unless we're aware that Alexa thyme is even a thing we go on Google searching answers for each of these problems how do I get my friends to invite me to think that's a very common problem no one is out there saying become more emotionally aware right when there's actually strong data that suggests that Alexa time is associated with all this so hopefully this quick foray into like kind of alexithymia 101 is illustrative helps you all understand a little bit about what's going on the good news is that Alexa thymia is not set in stone is there some evidence that it kind of gets classified as a personality trait but I've seen overwhelming clinical success in terms of like teaching people about their emotions so even when it comes to addiction I developed a meditation program for people who had addictions at McLean Hospital where the goal the focus of the meditation program was internal emotional awareness because I saw this sort of neuroscientific deficit and we picked all of the meditations that will help people become emotionally aware and what did we see as we started teaching people emotional awareness meditations they started relapsing less but for a brief period of time they started feeling worse they started acknowledging their negative emotions earlier but then they could reach out for help so made them feel a little bit emotionally worse in the short term reduced relapses over the long term and overall improved their mental health one year out so the good news is that there is stuff that you can do about this you just have to really understand that emotional awareness is a really really key component because it's like it's like literally chunks of our brain are all devoted to our emotions and if we don't really understand what those are how to regulate them it's going to cause all kinds of problems in our life if you found this video helpful check out Dr K's guide we've spent hundreds of hours
