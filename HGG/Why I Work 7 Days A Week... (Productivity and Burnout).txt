so if we really look at it a key thing to understand is that work is quite heterogeneous in nature and there may be some tasks that you really enjoy doing but there are other tasks that you really don't like and all of it kind of becomes work and a big part of what I'm going to share with you all today is how to understand those different segments of work so that you can optimize and actually like become the most productive over a long period of time so I want to talk to you all today about something a little bit different which is why I work seven days a week now this may sound kind of interesting right because nowadays everyone is so concerned about burnout everyone's like oh my God I'm burning out so much I also know that there's a there's a big kind of anti-work movement going on where people are sort of emphasizing I should be working less why do I have to work so much and I think a lot of that is really valid because you know we do have a lot of companies and managers and people like that who are really looking to extract the most labor out of people but what I'd love to share with you all today is a little bit about how I work seven days a week why I work seven days a week and the most shocking part of at all is why I really enjoy working seven days a week and how paradoxically working seven days a week actually decreases my burnout and leaves me feeling more energetic than before so I know that sounds kind of shocking especially if you're kind of listening this and you're feeling burnt out all the time and you're sort of struggling a little bit with like knowing hey I should be working more right you know that there's this like Sigma grind set and that people are like yeah like every day you work you got to be productive you got to do side hustles all this kind of crap and oddly enough I I do work seven days a week but I don't consider myself Sigma grind setting and if the sigma grind set isn't for you and actually you're kind of like lazy and sort of like about optimizing your workflow and trying to get the most value out of the least amount of work which is actually what I do hopefully this will be a little bit helpful to you so let's start off with the way that we usually start things here at HG which is to understand what work means and understand a little bit about why work is taxing and how work can actually be invigorating so there's a there's a famous kind of quote that people will say which is that if you do what you love you will never work a single day in your life and so there's this big debate about passion versus work you know if something is your passion people will also say if you turn it into your job it's the quickest way to extinguish your passion and so there's this tension between should I do what I love and make it my work so that I can work a ton or should I keep my passion separate and work as something like that should be completely separate from my passion work is a price that I pay a sacrifice that I make to be able to support my passions and then that in and of itself leads to more frustration as well because then if it kind of feels like okay I'm working you know five days a week for this tiny sliver of time so what I'd like to do is actually step away from all of that crap and start with the fundamentals let's start by understanding what is work how does work drain us how does work potentially even invigorate us or what invigorates us at work and as we understand some of those fundamentals I'll share with you all some of my experience about how I set up my work week so that I end up being quite productive and actually working seven days a week and feeling more energetic after all of it so let's start with defining terms so when I say work what I mean is something that produces value so I don't consider work I mean there are a lot of things that people you know I think are work and require effort and gain yield but we're talking about things like raising kids doing stuff at home potentially personal development stuff but for the sake of this talk I'm not focused on any of that stuff what I'm actually talking about is something that produces value in the external world right so it could be like doing tasks related to work it could be creative work we'll kind of talk a little bit about that but it's actually stuff that produces value the next thing that I want to kind of point out is that not all work is the same so when we say I'm burnt out from work if you really tunnel down into it not all the pieces of work are actually really what burns you out and this is what where I think we can start to understand this tension between doing what you love is a passion and sort of like how your passion gets ruined by turning it into your job because let's say I love playing the piano I may love the actual playing the piano and teaching students how to play the piano but all the stuff about building a website finding clients securing contracts chasing down people who cancel at the last second all of that stuff Burns me out so if we really look at it a key thing to understand is that work is quite heterogeneous in nature and there may be some tasks that you really enjoy doing but there are other tasks that you really don't like and all of it kind of becomes work and a big part of what I'm going to share with you all today is how to understand those different segments of work so that you can optimize and actually like become the most productive over a long period of time the next thing that we need to understand about work is that there are some tasks that are easier to do at particular times I'll give you all like just a simple example so I can usually teach a room of students at any time time during the day so for example like if I see patients from let's say eight to six and then I have to teach a lecture from six to eight pm I will have enough energy to do that if I just walk into the room and there's a group of students there even if I'm feeling kind of tired and I can kind of acknowledge that tiredness something about the enjoyment of working with a group of students at 6 PM like I can still kinda do it on the flip side there are some elements of work that actually make you tired no matter how energetic you are so on the flip side of teaching is one of the most draining activities that I have which is like administrative work or dealing with insurance companies and when 6 PM rolls around I have no energy left and I sure I can teach but if you ask me oh like Dr K do you want to do your billing paperwork and like write letters to insurance companies at 6 pm on a Friday I'll be like there's no way in hell I'm doing that and furthermore even if I do that work at like 10 a.m on a Monday I will feel so drained afterwards so the next thing we need to understand about work is simply that not all work is the same and that certain kinds of work will drain you more or invigorate you more so here are a couple of examples of different kinds of work that I tend to do on the weekend and some of the advantages of that the first is creative work so in my experience of doing like creative work and what I sort of mean by creative work is like ideating on lectures maybe thinking about particular things I want to talk about thinking about you know how to how to develop educational curriculum program development like this is all kind of creative work sometimes it also means like actual writing so writing fiction or non-fiction or things like that so there's like a certain pile of creative work and what I've sort of found about creative work is that it's not transmissible from day to day I can't do like 14 hours of creative work on a Monday and have it be the same quality as if I do creative work when I'm inspired so it's almost like I have this Creative Energy battery like this particular pool of Creative Energy which regenerates at a particular rate and I can't if I'm like if I run out of Mana when it comes to Creative Energy grinding even further sort of yields very like crappy outcomes so sure I could sit down and write 14 lectures in one day I could technically do that but the quality of the lectures will suck instead if I write like one lecture a day I wake up I kind of get excited by something and I do some amount of work and after about an hour I've got an outline for a particular lecture and I kind of feel like I've used some of that energy and it'll kind of regenerate later so one of the key things that I tend to do on the weekends is some amount of creative work or ideation and this is just the acknowledgment that work isn't perfectly interchangeable so if you've got this battery of energy you can sort of use it on a daily basis and I don't know if this kind of makes sense but I feel really good about myself when I do one hour of creative work on the weekends it feels so awesome to be like you know Sunday at 11AM rolls around and I've like written a really awesome lecture it's something that I want to share with the world it's something that I'm really excited about and the cool thing is since I did it on a Sunday like it's Sunday at 11 A.M and now I feel really great about myself right because I was like I was productive today today hasn't been an absolute waste not that it needs I mean it's okay if it is an absolute waste but I've been productive and so one key thing about working every day is I try to really like use that Creative Energy up because I can't always you know do 15 hours of creative work in a particular day so I find it to be quite efficient the other thing that I tend to do uh on the weekends especially but also spaced out is I tend to do a lot of my work related reading on the weekends so I tend to read somewhere between at a minimum 20 scientific papers a week and what I tend to find is that reading a little bit on the weekend like really helps me so I don't mean just like General reading right so what I'll do is sort of a focused topic that I get kind of curious about because like on the weekends I have some energy and as I have some energy I tend to get curious about things and what I tend to find is especially when it comes to doing things like reading scientific papers I can read five papers a day pretty easily but I can't read 35 papers in one day so what I'll tend to do is a lot of the research that I need to do okay if there are particular topics that I want to look up or like things that I want to learn about that I don't get the time to do during the week because I have all these other random tasks to do that's when I really think about zeroing on on the weekend and doing a lot of my reading now this leads to I think a really important segment which is part of the reason I really love working on the weekends or working seven days a week is it allows my brain to do something that I call mental composting so if we look at Neuroscience we know that the way that our brain processes information is quite complex so a couple of things that we know are pretty almost certain of is the first is that ideas get Consolidated through sleep so if I read let's say five papers or six papers on a Saturday night my ability to learn from those papers and use them the next week is way better better if I actually like give myself time to sleep on it so if I read five or six papers and then I kind of like go to sleep then what what's pretty cool about that is if I talk about them on Tuesday like I'll be able to recall statistics citations things like that so it's like some amount of energy that I start the process of composting the next thing that's really cool about that is that that mental process of composting actually generates ideas over time so if I sit down and let's say try to brainstorm for four hours on a Tuesday and I've got emails and meetings and stuff like that I don't know if this kind of makes sense but it's really hard to brainstorm on a Tuesday at 5 00 PM when you've been in meetings all day if I really want to create an environment that's conducive to brainstorming what I really want to do is give my mind time to like mull over things and what I've really found is that that mental composting yields a lot of efficiency if I space out my creative work so if I'm reading research articles on Saturday you know all I'll kind of remember them a little bit on Sunday I'll wake up on Sunday morning I'll be like oh that's kind of interesting I I liked this stuff from what I read let me investigate this tangent a little bit more so as I investigate that tangent a little bit I start to develop some kind of idea and then when Thursday afternoon rolls around now remember this is five days since I read the first research paper I sit down with with our our content team and we're sort of talking about ideas and I'll say hey I want to talk about this this and this and then as we bounce ideas back and forth I've actually done a lot of the work and so then what happens is like the lecture is sort of like halfway written I can sit down and write it in one hour because I've done that mental composting and we sort of know this about the human brain as well that we do a lot of our subconscious processing and connecting of ideas and pattern generation over time so the bizarre thing is that when I work seven days a week I actually find that the actual amount of work it takes to produce one thing goes down so if you had to sit me down on a Thursday morning morning and say hey I need you to write a lecture in in six hours about this thing it'll take me six hours to write it because I'm not giving my subconscious a chance to play around with that stuff I'm not doing that composting and so what I've actually found is by working on the weekend I can take a six hour task and actually reduce it to three hours and furthermore each step of the way I find incredibly gratifying because I want you all to just think about this for a second once I read something on Saturday I get curious about something let's read something if I get bored of it I'll set it down I'll go do whatever I want on Sunday I have this like kind of new idea I always let me like read about the second thing so I read about the second thing I feel way better about it and now I feel pretty good at the end of the weekend right because I've like I've done some work and then when Thursday rolls around and someone's like hey we need you to write a lecture about this or give a talk about this I'm like fantastic I can get that done in an hour and so that whole process actually like invigorates me because it's like wow this is really fantastic that I'm getting a lot done and it doesn't feel like a whole lot of work the last thing about working on the weekend that I think is really really important is that sometimes I enjoy way doing the work that I hate the most on the weekend now this may sound kind of bizarre but I want you all to bear with me for a second so there's some work that we all really really hate doing and generally speaking when there's work that we hate doing it hangs over our head it sort of weighs us down it kind of mentally paralyzes us makes us feel kind of overwhelmed and I want you all to think about a work week okay so when you think about let's say today's Monday but think about your work week and think about like how much stuff weighs in your mind it's like oh crap I have to do this I have to do this I have to do this and on Sunday night right so Sunday night is like the worst night of the whole week and why is that it's because tomorrow is Monday and so as you go into the week overwhelmed by your least favorite tasks because those are the things that occupy the most you're already burnt out on Monday morning so I want to give you all kind of a bizarre scenario imagine that on Sunday night the least favorite tasks that you have for the coming week were actually taking care of how would you feel about waking up on Monday morning because if you really think about what those tasks are oftentimes they're not actually large volume tasks it's not like 15 hours of work right it's usually like little crap that piles up it's like I have to fill out an expense report I have to take my car in to get registered it's this little crap that weighs on you and then when you're actually trying to do your work right because you sort of enjoy your work let's say I'm a graphic designer but on Tuesday I get an email from HR hey have you done the HR you know phishing training that you're supposed to do that's one hour and you're like oh crap I haven't done it it's a waste of time I gotta do it it's all so incredibly draining and so one of the things that I really discovered that was really bizarre is I looked at my week and I decided okay what is the thing that I hate the most I hate these small tasks where once again if I do one hour of HR training on a Tuesday at 1 pm at the end of it I kind of feel tired and don't feel like doing the rest of my work anyway and so bizarrely what I've actually discovered is is that if I really want to be efficient I want to feel good about it what I'll actually bang out is I'll do one hour of stupid you know HR related work or administrative work or the work that I really hate the most I'll do it on a Sunday and you may ask yourself wait wait doesn't that ruin your Sunday and actually not really so I do the work and then how do I feel afterward imagine Sunday at 2PM the stuff that you dread the most about this coming week is actually done it's invigorating it's actually freeing so now I'm like oh crap like I don't have to actually deal with this crap anymore right like I did it and now I get to go into Monday morning not having worried about this stuff so I know it sounds kind of paradoxical but I actually find that working seven days a week is actually quite invigorating it actually like I feel better about it I feel like I have more energy going into Monday morning having done some work on Saturday and Sunday the main reason for that is because I've realized that work is not homogeneous that there are different kinds of work and if I really want to optimize some of my energetic outputs if I want to optimize the value that I produce it actually means spacing out some work it's sort of really giving myself an opportunity to take advantage of my Creative Energy battery and making sure that I use some of it every day it's also giving my mind a time to like mentally compost so that I can start to generate a lot of ideas and that those ideas come out cleaner because my subconscious has already played with them that in turn leads to better outcomes right so once your ideas are organized in your head and you sit down and try to produce something out of it it ends up being like way cleaner and better received and the last thing this is the most bizarre thing that I discovered and this was through a lot of introspection is that the tasks that actually burn us out if we actually bang out even half an hour of them or an hour of them on the weekends it can be so mentally freeing like it actually it's like the feeling of checking things off your list and now you're going into Monday morning and you don't have to worry about that stuff because what is it that really Burns you out it's having to worry about that stuff and then since you're grappling with that crap you can't focus on the work that you actually enjoy your creative work takes a dip and once your creative work takes a dip that's the reason that you're actually there then you're not producing at the level that you really want to and as you're not producing at the level that you really want to you get increasingly frustrated and that sort of leads to burnout so I know it's quite paradoxical but one of the things that I've really discovered is that working seven days a week not only reduces my burnout it actually makes me like more productive and makes me feel more invigorated and also frees me up during the week to focus on the tasks that I really want to at work so I hope that's been a little bit helpful I know it's kind of bizarre it certainly isn't what I would call the sigma grind set but I'd encourage you all to think a little bit about the heterogeneity of work and really think about how to optimize your own Creative Energy if
