today we're going to talk about male type anxiety and that may sound weird because isn't anxiety anxiety but it turns out that anxiety is a gendered concept men experience anxiety very differently for from women and this is a big problem because if we look at our research on anxiety what we find is 2third of all people diagnosed with an anxiety disorder are women and so what's the reason for that let's just think about that for a second right does this mean that women are twice as likely to be anxious as men actually no it means that our definition of anxiety is a gendered construct and the way that women experience anxiety is what we think of as traditional anxiety but the way that men experience anxiety is actually completely different so male type anxiety is characterized by two things low perceived control and physical symptoms now this may sound kind of weird so let me explain what low perceived control is who have anxiety their experience of life is like this I'm surrounded by problems that are unfixable I sort of feel like I have no control over my life I kind of look around and I see see situations that I can't fix like my girlfriend is unhappy or my wife is unhappy or I keep on having conflict between my wife and my mom and I don't know how to fix this or I don't know what to do about my job my career prospects are crap the economy is crap I can't buy buy a house I can't date like everything is falling apart I can't control my life and everything is  so you may look at that and think but isn't that everyone like doesn't everyone struggle with this isn't just this the normal life and the answer is no it turns out that there's a good chance that anxiety is at the root but even weirder than that is that we have it kind of wrong so if we look at the world right now what we see is that there's a lot of problems that I can't fix and what we think goes on is that the world is objectively bad I cannot fix these things this increases our stress and then gives us a perception that we are out of control and we think that's an accurate perception right the world is therefore I can't fix it that's not in my head the crazy thing is that you're right it's not in your head it's way weirder than that the weirdest thing is we look at research on anxiety is not that this stuff is in your head but actually you create the situations that are unsolvable because you have this stealth anxiety now I know that sounds really weird so I'm going to say it again we think okay the world is crap I'm out of control right so the the circumstances come first and then maybe Dr K is making some point about oh this is like mindset or like cognitive reframing or it's all about perceptions it's about how we see the world and if I change the way I see the world things will be better and it's all in my head no no no what's actually going on is if you have occult anxiety this creates a perception of low perceived control and this per perception of low perceived control then creates events in your life that are unsolvable now if that sounds crazy hear me out because we're going to get into the science of it okay I'm going to show youall a lot of different research which are going to be pieces of a puzzle the tricky thing about this puzzle is that it's not going to make sense when you see one particular piece when we stitch it all together is when we will see holy crap the way that I am understanding my life and the way that I can get control of my life is actually very different from what I thought so bear with me when people hear that we offer coaching at HG their first question is like what on Earth even is that so here's the basic problem when you struggle with something in your life you don't see the problem from the outside you see it from the inside the value of a coach is that they can look at your life from the outside they can understand what's going on and they can help guide you to improve things like motivation accomplish short-term goals and even increase a sense of purpose in life and over the long term we also see improvements in feelings of depression and anxiety and the best part is we've had over 100,000 coaching sessions and we incorporate that feedback to continually improve our program so if y'all are interested in actually making a change in your life check out the link in the description below so this is from a paper called men's anxiety a systematic review so let's take a look at what men's anxiety looks like as such young men reporting increased anxiety severity were more likely to report physical symptoms headaches loss of appetite body Tremors and sensations of losing control instead of social disruptions tearing and interpersonal distress compared to age matched women so let's understand what this means okay the first thing we've got to do is Define it right so this is characterized by low perceived control and this is characterized by physical symptoms now why is this significant so if we look at anxiety diagnoses across the board they are 2 to one in favor of women so for every two women that's diagnosed with an anxiety disorder we have one man that is diagnosed with an anxiety disorder and why is this it's because our clinical criteria for an anxiety disorder are characterized by these other things that are more common in women so a lot of these characterizations are internal feelings like being worried being anxious right that's the word that we use these are anxiety disorders but it turns out that men don't feel that anxiety in the same way that women do and there are a couple of really good reasons for this the first is that women have more estrogen and estrogen as a hormone makes us more aware of our internal emotional state so women are able to feel their emotions more easily but it isn't that simple so in behavioral observation studies of boys and girls boys were disproportionately encouraged by parents to confront stressful and fearful stimulants whereas girls were more commonly comforted by their parents when displaying a fearful or anxious response so sure estrogen is is at play but then the way that we're socialized is also at play and what boys are taught to do is confront and fix our problems as opposed to doing some kind of emotional support or awareness okay so now we see these are like two reasons why men don't experience anxiety quote unquote normally because we're actually socialized to not focus on our feelings but to fix our problems okay so this is a second reason so this is why men men's anxiety and women's anxiety is different it's because the way that we're raised is because of estrogen so what contributes to men's anxiety in contrast higher endorsement of masculine Norms including restrictive emotionality restricted affectionate Behavior towards other men and over heterosexual presentation were all associated with increased levels of anxiety in young and adult men what on Earth restricted emotionality and heterosexual Norms hold on a second Dr K are you telling me that if I'm straight I'm more like likely to experience anxiety kind of right so many years ago I asked chat hey chat how should I deal with my anxiety and they were like Sagan nuts bro and it turns out that they they were right because now we have data that shows us that heterosexual Norms I.E preference for for a particular kind of genitalia is associated with higher levels of anxiety turns out that's not actually what the paper is saying so let's understand this okay what we mean by heterosexual Norms is restrictive emotionality and sort of burying our emotions so the manly man is not very emotional right so I'm like a man I'm G to fix my problems there blah blah so we don't talk about we fix them like if you we fixing that's what we mean okay has nothing to do with what your genital preference is it's entirely about your restrictive emotionality so this creates another challenge because if we are manly men right we just like good men like as boys we're like be a good man what this means is we're not aware of our internal emotional state which in turn means that even though our anxiety is high we don't feel anxiety right instead what we see is oh my God this situation is out of control and I can't fix it now we get to the craziest part which is remember that I said that the real tragedy of men's anxiety is that we believe our life is out of control and we sort of think like oh Dr K is talking about like oh we need to do something cognitive right to change my perception and then like once I like understand this all in my head then everything will be better no no no no no the crazy thing is our low perception of self-control doesn't just shape our internal environment it actually creates the problems that are unsolvable now if this sounds insane that's because it is so here's another paper fantastic paper from hour who's at mlan at Harvard so FY ry's an awesome person um the stress generation framework posits that characteristics behaviors or circumstances within an individual's life context contribute to the occurrence of dependent stressful events so this may sound crazy so what this sort of means is that more recently arbach art and Abella found that low perceived control a belief that one may have the limited ability to change views of the self world and future contributed to Greater dependent interpersonal stress the crazy thing about hour boox research is that it demonstrates that low perceived control isn't just in your head and it's not that you misinterpret the world it is that when you have low perceived control which is related to male type anxiety which you can't feel which we'll get to in a second when you have low perceived control it shapes the way that you interact with the world and creates unfixable situations so this a simple example okay so let's say that I I'm worried that I can't make my wife happy and so if I sort of believe that in some way that will affect my behaviors right I will try a little bit less because what's the point in making her happy if I'm doomed to fail what's the point in dating if I'm never going to find anyone anyway so as we start to have some of these perceptions of low uh low perceived control what the research actually shows is that this creates problems in our life it's not that the problem comes first and then I feel like I'm out of control it's actually the other way around perceived control as predictors of anxious symptoms and stress so the key thing about this paper is that this comes first it doesn't come next this predicts the anxiety this creates the anxiety this creates the stress it's not that the stress creates the P perception of low control it's the other way around okay here's me and here's the world and the world is and then what ends up happening is We believe We conclude I can't win right this becomes a logical conclusion so what ends up actually happening what the research shows us is here is me here is my perception of low control this creates a situation that is unsolvable this then generates stress now this gets kind of weirder right there are a couple of other things so this perception of low low uh perceived control is anxiety that we are blind to so we don't see it okay there's no seeing of the anxiety that's an eyeball we don't see the anxiety now why is this important why do I believe that anxiety is at the root of this so now we go back to the amygdala so see our amydala like men and women both have amigdalas we both have this  part of our brain like lizards have it too that this is where anxiety comes from the problem is that subjectively we don't experience it as anxiety so when the amydala lights up in a man because of our restricted emotionality because of our heterosexual Norms because of the way that we're taught to fix our problems we don't feel this anxiety but it's still active and let's understand what the impact of this anxiety actually is so let's say I have a problem that is of five difficulty and then what ends up happening is I have five units of anxiety and then what happens is these combine to create my actual perception which is 10 units of difficulty now I know this sounds kind of weird but I want youall to just think about this for a second right so think about the friends of yours who are anxious and they're worried about stuff right so when they're worried about stuff How likely is that thing to come to pass right so I'm paranoid that oh my God my teacher is going to kick me out of class because I sent an email asking for an extension so when anxiety when the amydala is active in our brain this isn't that they're they're not dumb or anything like that this is literally what happens in the amydala what the amydala does is amplifies the perception of things going bad so what it does is it like if if the risk is actually like 10% the amydala will literally amplify it to 20% or 30% or 40% okay now this is where things get really tricky so if we have amygdalar activity that we are not aware of because of emotional restriction now what we have is we have 10 units of difficulty and the actual difficulty is only five but this is our perception over here so now this problem seems larger than it is and this is where we get into really tricky things because once it starts to get out of control right because we can't handle 10 units 10 units is too much then get back to this so furthermore when evaluating socialized gender roles and coping Behavior individuals with higher levels of masculinity were more likely to employ problem-based coping regardless of biological sex so what this statement is talking about is that basically like the more masculine you are the more you try to fix your problems right and then this suggests a strong adherence to traditional masculine Norms may impact expectant coping behaviors in men prompting oriented problem solving approaches in in the face of elevated anxiety levels so this makes sense okay so I'm going to translate this for a second once again so this means is like if you're a dude and you've got a problem in life what do you do about the problem you fix it right that's all this is a fancy way of saying the more manly you are the more you just fix your problems because that's the like what else am I supposed to do with problems right if you're listening to this and you're like Dr K that's dumb what else are you supposed to do except for fix a problem like what else can you do here here's the problem in contrast there may be a threshold at which the tendency to revert to problem-based coping strategies exacerbates anxiety if Solutions cannot be reached by men accustomed to self- remedy okay previous research evaluating stress and coping suggests that problem-based coping may only be effective when stressors or situations are controllable or can be adjusted what this means is that problem based coping only works if you can fix the problem so then what happens in men when we can't fix a problem so now what let's go back to our diagram okay so this is important because if we can't fix the problem what does it do so now we get to see how everything ties together so here's what really happens here's me I am faced with a problem and then I have this occult which means hidden anxiety okay so this problem is five units and this anxiety adds five units of difficulty it's like we're playing the game on hard mode and this once we start playing the game on hard mode now this is 10 units of difficulty okay this mob is now too high for our level because we're level five but because of our occult anxiety we perceive this as level 10 as we perceive this as level 10 this creates stress why does it creates stress it creates stress because if we are faced with problems that we cannot fix what happens we get stressed out right so let's understand this so if I were to say Hey you person who is watching this YouTube video I want you to wash your hands does this stress you out no I don't need to be stressed out if I'm washing my hands because I am capable of doing it no biggie I can wash my hands stress is created when we Face problems that we perceive as unsolvable so as we perceive this problem is unsolvable this increases our stress increases our cortisol furthermore increases our anxiety even more and then also leads to physical symptoms headaches tension muscle aches all this kind of stuff nausea dudes have like the just these weird like aches and pains and like I'm not sure I need to go to the gym but I can't go to the gym like all this kind of stuff happens and then these two things then lead to a perception of low perceived control right because now this problem is too big to solve and then this leads to dependent stressors these are the actual problems that get created in your life this is the actual sequence of things it's not this up here it is actually the opposite it is this over here here's you here's a real problem plus anxiety this makes it overwhelming but you don't really see this remember this is we are not able to see see that this creates a stress response this then creates dependent interpersonal stressors this creates the problems in your life this is what the research shows and this is the real tragedy of male type anxiety first of all why are we not diagnosed with it because most people are not aware of this picture you all have to understand this this is put together from two places I did a bunch of research but then I also work with a bunch of people who are blackpilled so when I work with people who are black K what do they say they say this is going wrong this is going wrong this is going wrong this is going wrong I can't fix my life this is screwed this is screwed this is screwed this is screwed and then Along Comes Dr K now everyone thinks oh my God Dr K is a miracle worker like maybe Dr K can fix me but I can't fix all those problems I can't fix any of those problems right I can't fix the dating crisis I can't fix this other kind of stuff I can't fix any of that so it turns out that when I work with someone who's blackpilled what I really Target is there underlying occult anxiety so this whole sequence can be broken apart if you understand how it works and understand where to target things where is the real Inception of this the Inception of this is the unfelt anxiety that exacerbates your problems the the real place to Target this is when your amydala amplifies the size of a danger right and I want you all to think back to when you were little kids and you were scared in your room at night and when you were scared if your parents tried to tell you hey there's no real danger this problem does not exist could you understand no this problem does not exist of course not the child believes that the shadow on the wall is a monster it takes this hypothetical fear and turns it into a reality and the crazy thing about people who are blackpilled and they will dispute this is they are living in the same world that we are living in right we're all living in the same world things are hard for everyone but they say oh no no but my chin is smaller and I'm 5'2 everyone has some objective disadvantages I'm not talking I'm not saying that but I'm saying fundamentally this part we need to really focus on and this has been my experience when we target the anxiety when we reduce the anxiety this whole Cascade falls apart so then you are faced with problems that are no longer overwhelming once you are faced with problems that no longer feel overwhelming then your stress level goes down as your stress level goes down your perception of control increases and this is the Beautiful Thing Once your perception of control increases you actually start fixing the problems in your life you stop creating additional problems because of your perception of low self-control and we hear this advice everywhere right just get started just get started just get started just act and this is the tragedy of male type anxiety we probably have a bunch of men out there maybe as much as 5% of to the population so one out of 20 men who's experiencing anxiety in some way but they're not aware of it all they see is that the world is black pilled I can't do anything about this I can't do anything about this I can't do anything about this I can't do anything about this and the tragedy of that is it is that belief that creates the objective situations and just in your head this actually creates the problems in your life so what do we do about it start by first of all does this picture fit you right do you look at the world and is your primary experience of the world hey or not may maybe not primary but a big part of your experience that I feel out of control if you feel out of control you may have this male type anxiety the icing on the cake is going to be if you also have these like physical symptoms and stuff like that this is going to be really another really important sign the cool thing is the way that we're going to fix this by all means go see a therapist get a diagnosis start doing Psychotherapy all that stuff is really fantastic but the couple of things that we need to change are first of all our emotional awareness to recognize is my amydala in a hyperactive state right and you won't feel worried or tearful or anxious you'll just be like stressed out right so the the the main thing that you're going to feel is stress and physical symptoms and and low perceiv control then you have to do the hard work of uncovering that anxiety uncovering these distortions uncovering the source of your perception that your control is not there in life and as you target those kinds of things so we have a whole guide to anxiety we do all these different exercises and community events and stuff like that basically focus on that anxiety because it's not going to look like anxiety but do all of those same kinds of things so physical exercise is really great for men um Mind Body practices are really fantastic too but really Target that anxiety and what you will see is something that I've seen with black pillars over and over and over again who I've worked with is that something changes once we start decompressing that emotional energy literally once we start calming down the amydala suddenly this is a child in a bedroom who sees that this is not an actual monster this is just a shadow and it could be a monster monster could be a monster let's be honest could be a monster things could be bad things may not work out but their their amydala is not amplifying the danger and making it feel more real as that goes away our sense of control increases and once we have a perception that we can fix this game of life then things actually start to get better we see those dependent stressful events start to improve and then their life objectively gets better so if you're a dude out there in this fits please please please take it very seriously consider seeing a professional about it consider working on your anxiety and if yall want more information check out our guide to anxiety and the last thing that you can do remember those heterosexual Norms lead to an increased experience of anxiety that we don't even feel so I'll let you figure out what that last thing you can potentially do is take care [Music] n
