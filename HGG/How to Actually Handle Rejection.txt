so rejection sensitivity sensitivity is really common and people are always trying to get rid of it if i am afraid i'm ugly if i'm afraid that i'm overweight what am i gonna be sensitive to and the standard answer is get rejected over and over and over again and that's by standard answer we're not saying it's wrong there's a certain truth to it right but that's not easy to engage in and it's not sometimes helpful whereas if we think about it each of those rejections is associated with a lot of pain right it hurts like you can't just ask someone to go outside and go swimming in lava every day for like a week like they're not gonna do that right it's really hard so how can we understand this a little bit better and how can we sort of potentially get some control over i have a tough time handling rejection hey everyone i could really use some advice about how to get rid of this rejection sensitivity i'm having the most small sign what the most small sign of rejection makes me feel absolutely miserable i get insecure and feel hurt at first and then angry at the person that i feel rejected by there were many times where it left me miserable for days or even weeks now it happens more often that i sometimes react openly to it by being a bit off or being a bit colder just to regret it a few minutes later because it just turned out to be in my head this is really in the way this is really getting in the way of making friends or finding some at least but i can't shut my emotions off in that moment i'm 22 and shouldn't be such a child anymore does anyone on here know how to get rid of this so this is something that is this is something that a lot of people struggle with that we have a difficult time handling rejection right and what we're looking for is a way to get rid of it so this is where like you know a lot of people will say like oh you know you just like handling rejection is about developing thick skin right so even we'll say that we'll say like okay it's like it's about practice it's about experience you know you got to get rejected over and over and over again survive it and then you'll realize that like you know it's not that bad right and that's how you get over handling rejection you just have to be rejected which there's truth to but if you really think about it like it's terrifying right so if you tell someone yeah like the way to get over your phobia of snakes is to spend more time with snakes like that's the reason that we have exposure to therapy and psychiatry we're like oh yeah like let's let's expose you to it the only way to learn how to handle getting rejected is to get rejected which is maybe true right but like it's actually terrifying if you really think about it it's like really really terrifying because these people don't want to you don't want to do that it's like if you have someone who's afraid of snakes and you're like the solution to get over your fears we're going to drop you in a pit of snakes like they're not going to want to do that if you have trouble with rejection and you you get you're sensitive to rejection you have trouble handling it you're not going to sign up for it right in fact it's that's not like a personal failing which by the way a lot of people feel like they have right there's a lot of self-judgment here so you're almost like rejecting yourself in this process well i'm such an idiot for being so sensitive to rejection i should have grown up by now which in that moment what are you doing to yourself you're rejecting yourself you're not accepting yourself you're not cutting yourself any slack and so this is sort of where it honestly starts right so why are we so sensitive to rejection generally speaking as human beings the things that we're sensitive to are the things that we ourselves are insecure about or the things that we do to ourself if i am afraid i'm ugly if i'm afraid that i'm overweight what am i gonna be sensitive to comments that other people make about me potentially being ugly or being overweight and sometimes what'll even happen is they're not even making comments about my weight right like but the way that my mind is so primed it's gonna assume that a neutral comment is going to be interpreted as a comment about what i'm sensitive to so rejection sensitivity sensitivity is really common and people are always trying to get rid of it and the standard answer is you know get rejected over and over and over again and that's by standard answer we're not saying it's wrong there's a certain truth to it right because once you get rejected a couple times and you survive then you'll realize like oh it's actually like not that bad or it won't devastate me the way that it i thought it would but that's not easy to engage in and it's not sometimes helpful right so it's not like go out there and get rejected a thousand times then you'll overcome your rejection sensitivity whereas if we think about it each of those rejections is associated with a lot of pain right it hurts like you can't just ask someone to go outside and and go swimming in lava every day for like a week like they're not gonna do that right it's really hard so how can we understand this a little bit better and how can we sort of potentially get some control over it okay so let's talk about this okay so how do we overcome rejection sensitivity okay so the first thing to understand is that oftentimes the rejection sensitivity the sensitivity itself comes from self perception right and we kind of saw that over here we look at this like you know i shouldn't be such a child anymore right so like we'll see that oftentimes so the first thing that you can do is on a core level like try to understand where did you get the idea that you were worthy of rejection because if you're sensitive to something chances are it's a fear that you hold internally right like so what i would kind of ask yourself is why are you rejectable and as long as you have the belief that you are rejectable it's going to be easy to be rejection sensitive right so this is actually like the cap the foundation of it so this is where if you you do something like see a therapist or like work on your some scars or things like that so a lot of like spiritual practices and stuff you'll discover this kind of thing right as we like meditate and do this kind of stuff you can do it sort of clinically or non-clinically if you've got a you know serious problem and you have social anxiety or like real problems with your relationships i'd recommend a clinician but you can do this kind of internal work without necessarily going to therapy okay so that's the first thing is like understand the core of your sensitivity and if you can work on that core of sensitivity by exploring when did your brain learn that you are rejectable and then as you think about those experiences as you really process and you realize that chances are the reason you're rejection sensitive today is because there was someone who rejected you super hardcore and hurt so much and you carry that hurt around with you and you you're so afraid of that happening again that like you know it's kind of projecting into your current life okay second thing is that when people are rejection sensitive what they want to do is get rid of it right we want this thing to just go away and so this in a sense is one way of getting rid of it but like the goal here is to how can i say this the goal here is to change our reaction or change our mind whereas what we're going to share with you today is a couple of things that you can do um that may actually help with this okay a couple of other things that you can do the next thing to think a little bit about is when we sort of talk about other ways to get rid of it there's sort of the thick skin approach right which is if you get rejected enough you'll get thick skin and then it won't hurt as much hurt less right but this is the kind of thing that's like absolutely terrifying because i want you all to understand this so if you have a person who's rejection sensitive and you tell them to like get rejected and this hurts like this is the whole point that you're trying to avoid this is why you want to get rid of it right you're trying to avoid this at all costs you want to be cured of the rejection sensitivity so everything that your mind is doing in terms of even this kind of stuff so when we get rejected we feel hurt so what do we do when we get if we get rejected right so sometimes we internalize it for weeks i feel hurt on the inside but i'm not gonna say anything to anyone for weeks so like when we get rejected we just take that feeling we stuff it down in there we live with it it ruins our life for days or weeks and you're telling this person to go out there and get rejected they're gonna get rejected once they're gonna go for days or weeks feeling bad about themselves and then you're gonna be like good job now go out there and do it again or what happens is that and then what happens they get fed up with dealing with internally and then what do they start doing they start lashing out they get cold right this is what this person said now it happens more often that i sometimes react openly by being a bit off or being a bit colder so what's going on there it's like here's our bucket of bad feelings and so why are we and it's filling up with the toxicity of i got rejected i got rejected rejected and then at some point it starts overflowing and so now we start sometimes we'll lash out but what's more common is we'll start acting cold right and why do we do that it's because like it's kind of passive aggressive because we can't actually lash out like we can't like overtly get mad at them but we're gonna punish them for hurting us so i'm gonna give this person the cold shoulder and then what happens then is like this screws up our relationships because on the one hand like here's this person that could be my friend that makes me feel hurt for weeks and then i give them the cold shoulder and i don't really understand like what is going like they don't understand what's going on i feel hurt by them and so now like they're asking me hey for hey you want to go grab dinner sometime and you're like i don't know maybe and then the friend is confused because they don't understand what's going on there's all this rich internal stuff that's going on within me when i get rejected which they have no idea about and so then it gets confusing for them they stop texting me they get frustrated that feels like another rejection and then like this whole cycle repeats again right so what can you do here so i do think that there's value in all of these things but there are two other things that i'm going to show y'all that are kind of like really important one is perception and the second is communication so the key thing here that a lot of people miss out on on rejection sensitivity is how their perception is screwing them so let's look at this and we can see it right here the most small sign of rejection makes me feel absolutely miserable this is the key thing so a lot of times when we talk about growing internally or growing psychologically we're always trying to control our reactions or we're trying to control our internal environment or we're trying to control our actions right so if we think about like if if someone has a problem okay there's signal reaction and action and if you if you look at what people are asking for and where solutions are right it'll always be here and here and we're missing a third of it so let me give you all an example so how do i get rid of this feeling how do i overcome my social anxiety how do i stop thinking about this how do i not get hung up on that right how do i let go of an ex how do i get over this relationship how do i stop thinking about her all the time thinking about him all the time how do i stand up for myself how do i set boundaries right how do i speak up for myself how do i talk to my parents so everyone's talking about the reaction and the action how do i stop feeling this way i want a magic bullet or magic wand that takes away the reaction i want to shape my behavior and so there are solutions there for sure here's what we're missing the perception because if you can alter your perception that'll change your reaction and by definition will change your action right because the action is based on the reaction the reaction in turn is based on the perception so that one area that i think is very very very underutilized in terms of self-growth is being critical and shaping your perceptions so let's think about this a little bit more carefully so this the most small sign of rejection makes me feel absolutely miserable now if you are imagine you're in a relationship with this person how can you work how can you interact with them how can you avoid this right if i'm your friend and we'll see this like sometimes with these like horror texts right of dating apps and things like that where like the smallest sign of rejection makes you feel miserable but it's like it's not actually a sign of rejection they're not actually rejecting you it's just life right so if i don't text you back within five minutes you feel rejected your perception is oh this person is on on the cusp of rejecting me rejecting me and let's understand why this is this isn't stupid it's because i don't know how to so when we get rejected it hurts a lot okay so when we get rejected and we get weeks of misery what is our brain going to adapt to do it's going to learn how to like predict this as easily as possible right so if something is like so like we've seen this in for example parents of children who have had serious accidents where like if you have a serious accident if your child is a serious accident you take him to the hospital the first sign of that thing repeating triggers the parent and that's absolutely adaptive it's absolutely evolutionary we're not going to let it get to that point ever again we've seen it in i've seen it in marriages where there's a lack of you know the people have had affairs and then what happens to the person who's cheated on they're paranoid in the first sign of infidelity creates an explosion of reaction y'all get that so this is not it's not like this person is stupid for a small sign creating a reaction it's because if there's a bad consequence and it happens once our brain is going to learn how to predict it if it happens again we're going to learn how to predict it if it happens again we're going to learn how to predict it and then eventually what happens is like you know the signal over here is small the signal over here is larger the signal over here is larger right and so smaller and smaller things are going to cause us to react which is just our brain's way of protecting us it's like you know there's there's rain clouds in the sky there's thunderstorms there's thunderstorms there's rain clouds there's regular clouds and there's the beginning of clouds there's a change in barometric pressure our brains and our survival mechanisms have learned how to move earlier and earlier and earlier and detect smaller and smaller signs and the more the emotional impact is the smaller the signs that we're going to look for so what can you do recognize that this is what your brain is designed to do but that it is a maladaptation so what you really need to control is your perception the the key moment is here that you can work on so if you have someone where you've the smallest sign of rejection that's where you need to catch your mind you need to say hold on a second what actually happened and before you because once you jump on that conclusion once you board the train of rejection you're sol you're screwed so how do you avoid boarding that train how do you avoid getting the reaction and then engaging in the action how do you avoid that right so this is this line and then this line the way is by noticing the perception this is the key thing so what are you perceiving what actually happened how are you interpreting it that way these are the questions that you need to ask yourself and start with the smallest thing possible right so if someone doesn't text you back rather than like oh my god i'm getting rejected and like texting them back like oh like why aren't you texting me text me back text me back takes me back i'm so mad at you or then what happens is you adopt the cold shoulder right so then when they text you you and your mind are like i'm not gonna i'm gonna they made me wake i'm gonna make them wait and you resolve to yourself that whatever they text me i'm gonna not respond to them for 24 hours that'll teach them because that's what's going on right and that doesn't help your relationship so notice the perception why does my mind why is this interpreting it this way right like what are the other possibilities here this is where cognitive reframing comes up so like go through a differential diagnosis for what you perceive as a rejection ask yourself why does my mind perceive this as a rejection and it's going to be really hard because you're going to automatically jump to that conclusion but look at the actual thing like write it down like what did they do and how do i feel and this is where the antidote the second antidote to this is communication so this is where like communication isn't perfect right so if i don't text you back there could be a thousand reasons for that and anytime there's a disconnect between two people communicating like resolves that perceptual problem so if you didn't text me good night like every night i feel really hurt by that i feel rejected by that but i never understood that you don't really like get any value out of that right so like it doesn't really mean much to you when i text you good night it's not that important to me because human beings are all going to be operating off of their internal like road map of what's okay and what's not okay what's important and what's not important because what's important to you may not be what's important to them and so how do you resolve that perceptual gap because here's the problem is you're judging their actions based on your internal roadmap which is why a small signal makes you feel so so rejected whereas they're completely oblivious to it because it's not that big of a deal to them and it's not that you're stupid for it being a big deal to you or they're stupid for not understanding if there isn't a right or wrong here the key thing here is communication now the tricky thing here is that people who are ejection sensitive are terrified of communication and this is the last thing that i'll kind of leave you with if you're sensitive to rejection sometimes communication can be absolutely terrifying because these techniques like the cold shoulder these passive aggressive kind of moves preserve some degree of safety they preserve like some amount of like nebulousness into which you can't truly get rejected and so sometimes if you're rejection sensitive having a conversation is opening yourself up to the biggest possible rejection because if we if i tell them that texting every night is really important to me and it matters a lot to me and then they don't do it then it's a rejection of the highest order because i've explained to them how important it is right so it can be terrifying to try to have communication but i'd say if you're sensitive to rejection sure you can deal with the core of it you can sort of try to make your reaction go away you can start to adjust your actions yeah vroom right but at the end of the day what you got to be super super super careful about is your perception this is the thing that is missed the most because it is in your perception that the whole cycle starts so you all got to be super careful about that okay questions no baby elephantism is next are such signals types of trauma sort of right so this is where so trauma shapes our perceptions and shapes our behaviors but trauma is not the exclusive thing that shapes our perceptions and shapes our behaviors right trauma is a particular event that shapes our perceptions and behaviors in a particular way so i would say that people who are rejection sensitive have probably undergone some kind of trauma but i don't know if it's like it's a word that gets thrown around a lot right so like sort of is the answer how to be more mindful of perception the first thing is to look for it the first thing is when you react pause and track back because here's the thing if you're rejection sensitive you really want to look at how you feel in the moment and you really want to look at all of the stuff you're going to do i'm going to be cold to them i'm not going to respond to them i'm going to show them i feel hurt i can't believe they did this and then your mind like boards this train and it's like thinking about the future and thinking about how you feel and thinking about how you feel what caused the rejection or the source of the rejection gets you just blow right past that man so go back and say hold on a second what made me feel this way and what do they actually do because if you can alter your perception then it changes the reaction and then it changes how you act the perception is key because oftentimes with rejection sensitivity we are sensitive what does the word sensitive mean it means that a small signal creates a large response my skin is sensitive don't touch it there i'm really sensitive about my weight don't talk about my weight right so that the word sensitivity literally means disproportionate reaction to a small signal and so focus on the signal that's where you can start to shape your reaction to the signal because once once the reaction happens then it's really hard to manage so it's the thing that people leave out and by all means like get rejected i mean the more you get rejected we'll see this a lot with dating for example right you got to put yourself out there a couple times to realize that you'll survive a rejection okay giggy chad get rejected yeah so that's like that's hard for people who are rejection sensitive right it's really easy for people who are who have the confidence to be rejected to tell people who don't have the confidence to be rejected just go get rejected for people saying just change your perception so the first thing is recognize that perception is part of the equation and then explore it you'll be surprised at how how low hanging the fruit is yeah does rejection sensitivity have roots sometimes in a lack of validation from an early age absolutely it often times because your brain learned to be wary of rejection somehow you all get that like it learned that lesson that rejection is dangerous rejection hurts and so it had to learn that lesson somewhere yeah so notice the perception and challenge your beliefs that's a great way to put it we're not saying that you have to explicitly just challenge them right because for now right now you just taken them for granted there's no scrutiny and that's where like you'll be surprised at how far a little scrutiny goes is becoming the observer like in meditation a good way to get a new perspective 100 yes so as we become the observer we separate ourselves from the reaction and therefore the reaction dies down right so i think there's a there's a video in dr k's guide to meditation about how we fuse with our thoughts and how it is that meditation is a scientifically validated intervention for all mental illnesses like that's like i think that's fair maybe not all but you know a surprising majority of them so it helps for borderline personality disorder helps for depression helps for anxiety helps for adhd so how does that work it's because on a fundamental level meditation helps you pull away from your mind and be more objective and the common thing about all these mental illnesses is that we get caught up in our mind so there's some videos in there about the nature of thought and like how does thought work and how does mind work and how do we separate from our mind and what happens when we separate from our mind okay yeah so someone's saying i had an anxiety attack yesterday because of rejection and doing the observer thing suddenly calmed me down it was insane absolutely so what if what about if you have trauma and the meditation triggers it so i i recommend particular meditation techniques for people with trauma so here's the thing to remember about trauma and meditation when we have trauma our mind develops suppressing mechanisms or protective mechanisms where we wall the trauma off often times when we meditate especially from the mindfulness tradition and let's remember that mindfulness is like five percent of like the meditative tradition the problem is that it's become the most popular so everyone assumes that mindfulness is meditation so mindfulness is about observing and letting go and pulling back and so when you create that kind of vacuum sometimes the trauma gets sucked past the defense mechanisms and that negative pressure in the mind that vacuum in the mind pulls the trauma up so that's why if you look at you know clinical clinical interventions meditative interventions they tend to be more grounding in nature so they're not going to create a vacuum in the mind in fact the opposite so if you look at mindfulness practices in dbt they call them mindfulness practices but they're really grounding meditations they're really focusing your mind in a particular place it's the opposite of a vacuum and so there so if you have trouble with trauma and mindfulness that's what i'd say find a competent teacher who is like trauma informed and can teach you an appropriate meditation for trauma is there a difference between buddhist and hindu meditation sure but that assumes that buddhist and hindu meditation are also monolithic which they're not right so buddhism has tons of traditions of meditation with lots of different techniques hinduism has the same but generally speaking i'd say that there is more overlap between the traditions than within the traditions so there is tantric buddhism and there is tantra hinduism which are basically very similar so the difference between vajrayana buddhism and like mahayana buddhism is greater than the difference between hindu and buddhist meditation essentially but this meditation is hindu meditation it's all the same tradition which i know sometimes will like offend people but let's remember that the techniques that would the taught and the techniques that would learn were from quote unquote hindu teachers right like they're all the same this techniques are the same you
