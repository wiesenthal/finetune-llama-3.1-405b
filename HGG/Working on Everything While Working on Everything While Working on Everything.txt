a society has told us you can't not do this it makes you a bad person if you don't work on your relationships like what kind of human being are you oh my god like if you eat processed food what kind of human being are you you know i want to get married at this age i'm gonna have my first kid at this age i'm gonna get second get at this age i make this much money i'm gonna retire we have like this timeline right and we think that life is a race recognize that it's okay if your life is a dumpster fire it's not actually a dumpster fire unless it's a dumpster fire focus on like two or three things at a time and it's okay to not be perfect you don't have to be like life is not actually a race you don't have to be ahead of the pack i don't even know where the pack is [Music] so one of the challenges in life is that you're working your job while working on your mental health while working on your relationships while working on physical health while working on your family while working on your sleep habits while working on self-care while working on exercise while working on personal goals while working right so like i think one of the things that's happened is we've started to realize that a lot of this stuff is work that you need to spend some time on right like you have to devote time to it so i get the sense that in my parents generation you know no fault of theirs but people weren't quite as cognizant like about mental health and the fact that mental health needs to be like taken care of right so uh you know the concept of seeing a therapist when my dad was my age was like pretty foreign especially in india or even like 20 years when he was like 20 years old it was like completely foreign like they didn't exist in india or very few of them did and then the other thing is like when it comes to family and relationships and stuff that too was sort of like they just kind of worked themselves out right so like when in 20 years ago 50 years ago 60 years ago just to like share a story with y'all so when i talk to my grandmother now about like relationship stuff she like shushes me so she'll be like oh like you know like there are problems in every marriage there are problems you know these things happen like don't dwell on them just you know everything will be fine and there's kind of like this sweep it under the rug mentality and i realized that like a lot of that sweep it under the rug mentality comes from a social situation in which change is not viable so like talking about it or complaining about it or things like that were not like really useful interventions so my grandmother grew up in a time where divorce was like unheard of and economic options were very few and far between right so you like get married you have a joint family unit the joint family unit which means that you live with your parents and potentially like siblings or in-laws or whatever and so you'll have like 10 12 14 people living in a single household and the reason for that is because people were like farmers and you like needed to have shared labor and shared resources and stuff like that you had your own internal small economy she grew up in a in a village that had like 150 people and you know going to the next village over which was like a three or four hour walk was like a big deal so it was like an event right it's kind of like for us flying internationally people would like go you know once in the first 20 years of their life they're like oh yeah i went to like that other village and oftentimes it'll be for some kind of occasion like you know getting married or something like that there just wasn't a whole lot of like viability for changes divorce economic freedom independence so like talking about family stuff wasn't a d it wasn't a thing like there was no point in talking about it because you you're dealt the hand that you're dealt the power dynamics are also very very like or strong right so like they're hierarchical so like if the head of the household doesn't like what you're doing you don't have any kind of recourse there's no option b you're gonna have to live there and they don't have to listen to you so that's sort of like i think what's happened is that attitude which may have been quite severe in india like back in like 1930 1940 places like that i don't know exactly what things were like in the u.s and not everyone in india lived in that sort of situation right so there's heterogeneity there for sure but i think the the big thing is that there wasn't a cognizance that this kind of stuff you work on like physical health maybe people were aware of you got to kind of take care of your physical health don't eat a bunch of sweets you know like exercise here and there and then work too was something that was sort of like handed to you back in the day and now i think what's happening is we're gaining an awareness as our society changes as we have upward mobility as we have lateral mobility as we have the options to choose our relationships to a certain degree choose your work and also as the stresses of this current society bear down on us things like sleep and family and mental health are like more under attack right so when i was like a farmer a hundred years ago like i wake up when it's time to wake up and i go to bed when it's time to wake up there's nothing to do there's like literally like there's no electricity so like once the sun goes down like unless other people are willing to socialize there's like nothing to do i can't stay up till 4am doing nothing there's like literally nothing to do and so now what we have is we have like entertainment in our fingertips right you can stay up all night long if you want to like there's plenty to do you can text people you can browse reddit you can you know troll people on twitter like trolling people on twitter is a 24 7 kind of activity and so like now we've realized like oh crap this stuff needs work but when do you have time to do it right because work needs work too and work is no longer like show up at nine and leave at five like clock in and clock out right everyone wants you to distinguish yourself you gotta be a leader you gotta get promoted gotta get a raise you can't be content at work you gotta hustle right you gotta have your hustle at work you gotta have your side hustle there's hustle and side hustle right and so we gotta have hustle gotta have side hustle gotta make your boss happy boss now has to make you happy which we'll see right it's just so much stuff to do like when are you supposed to have time to do this like the by the way there's no entertainment here you got to work on your relationships got to work on your family set boundaries with them talk to them manage their emotions it's a pandemic gotta move in with them your sibling is like doesn't respect your boundaries they're expecting free child care from you because they decided to have children when you have decided not to have children because you're still focused on your career but they got pregnant and they're six years younger than you are and now they're losing their weekends and they're like i don't understand like i need a break and it's like you should have thought about that before you have kids and then what they do is they start messaging your parents then your parents start messaging you and then like right so now you got to work on that and your sleep is screwed up and you're drinking too much coffee and mom is a q anon sure right so oh my god like don't get me started on man i have seen vax and anti-vax philosophies like tear apart families during the pandemic it's wild like like you need to get vaccinated because grandpa's got heart failure and is on oxygen already and can't afford to get sick because he's on prednisone and it's like i'm not going to get vaccinated because i'm not a sheeple and then like tears families apart right and then like people say oh yeah i'm vaccinated and they show up at christmas they're not vaccinated they're asymptomatic carriers of kovid grandpa gets sick of kovid dies and then oh it's bad right i mean it's just so there's just so much to handle right now and like i don't know how people are supposed to get a break like i don't know it's just overwhelming there's just so much stuff you need to do i mean i think that this is where like i don't have wild wisdom that is gonna make this easy i think this is the society that we live in where we're you know we're being assaulted on several different sides like we're managing so many things i think part of the upside though to this that's kind of weird is that we're at least aware that these are things that you can work on right so like people have resources at their disposal for like the first time in human history about how to deal with a parent who has borderline personality disorder how to deal with a child who's narcissistic how to support a child who has an addiction like all these kinds of things we have resources for we have tools for sleep habits right we've got melatonin which you can get over the counter and we've got you know apps that you can download that will help you train your sleep schedule and we also have things like sleep studies and therapists and cbt for insomnia and all this kind of stuff we also have all these people who will you know tell you how to be successful at your work on youtube right and it's great because we have all these resources and so surely what that means is everyone is getting promoted right because i watch these five videos about how to get promoted how to make a million dollars how i made my first million in two years and so everyone's walking around with a million bucks because look at all these people out there telling us how to do it and it's so easy and so sometimes what happens is we're kind of like we do this sort of stuff and then we're kind of confused when like i'm watching all these youtube videos and it's not working right and then we wind up like this because the subtle thing here is that these are all things that i need to work on because i have to work on your job and i have to work on my mental and i have to work on my physical i have to work on my relationships i have to do my family i have to do this i have to self-care exercise sleep habits hustle side hustle try hustle right because that's what successful people do if you want to have a successful marriage you got to work at it man if you want to have a successful career you got to work at it man if you want to exercise properly you got to work at it girl right because we got to do all this stuff because here's this person on instagram telling us how we should exercise and here's this you know doctor on twitch or neuroscientist who has a podcast who's going to talk about sleep and meditation and now i got to meditate we didn't even she didn't even include this meditation is a big one i got to learn how to meditate right so what do you do about this stuff the first thing is take a step back take a big deep breath and figure out that or understand a couple of things you can't work on everything at the same time it's just impossible you just really can't the other thing to understand is that if you work at something it doesn't take work forever so generally speaking the establishment of a habit is the hard part and once the habit sets in or once you make some kind of progress once you learn how to communicate better in a relationship that carries with you so everyone wants to do everything by a certain time and so i'd say let go of that you know i want to get married at this age i'm going to have my first kid at this age i'm going to get second get at this age i make this much money i'm going to retire we have like this timeline right and we think that life is a race so like somewhere along the way we got the idea that life is a race i'm behind oh my god that person is crushing it they made their first million by 2 this person made their first million by 22 right because we have that now with esports and streaming and youtubers and all this kind of stuff i remember being at the twitch awards oh sorry not twitch awards the streamer awards and meeting other streamers and like you know because like you meet people and then you make small talk and i was like you know hi my name is all look it's nice to meet you there's like another stream in there and they're like oh my god i'm such a huge fan i'm a sophomore in college and i'm studying psychology and it's like we're peers right it's wild i think it's great that they're studying psychology i think it's great that they're a very successful streamer but somewhere along the way we start making comparisons and we think that we got to go fast and if you look at that tweet what happens is like we're trying to do it all at once because society has told us you can't not do this it makes you a bad person if you don't work on your relationships like what kind of human being are you oh my god like if you eat processed food what kind of human being are you right like if you don't hustle and side hustle and try hustle and quad hustle right like what kind of human being are you like you're not gonna be one of the successful humans there's like the successful humans over here who are crushing it and rocking it and posting stuff on instagram and like doing all this stuff pen to hustle like i'm gonna develop you know if we ever decide to do something besides healthy gamer i'm gonna develop the penta hustle machine that both allows you to eat exercise meditate work and nofap all at the same time it's going to be this device that you plug yourself into and it's going to do everything for you all at once there's gonna be a chastity belt there's gonna be a meal tray we're gonna we're gonna stick in a gastric tube so you can get ideal nutrition you don't have to waste time cooking or eating because you know what the worst roi is consuming food and then we're gonna do this thing where we have a constant we're gonna have two ivs running one with ketamine and one with caffeine that way we can like reduce our sleep to highly efficient three hours a day with biofeedback and then i'm gonna take this device and i'm gonna stick it into a sensory deprivation chamber so i can get utter relaxation with vr goggles so i can interact with people in the world right because this is what's happening now we have this like tech hustle culture too who are saying oh by the way the solution i don't know if you guys know did you guys know this the solution to this problem is a sensory deprivation infrared sauna do you guys didn't realize that right like we're gonna oh by the way download our app it'll help too it uses science and look at our board we have a scientist on there because we got to do everything all at once so here's what's happening right we have to do everything all at once and then society is there you could talk about capitalism if you want to but if you're looking to buy something that doesn't exist someone will make it for you they're like oh you're trying to do everything all at once didn't you know that there's this device that improves your meditative efficiency by 88 absolutely we have a scientist on our board and didn't you know that you would sleep better if you ate organic purchase this thing and it will improve your life having difficulty with your relationships here let us sell you i i literally i kid you not i once talked to someone who's having trouble communicating with their child and they purchased a set of musical tapes that will make their child more emotionally aware and better able to communicate and they were just they made their kid listen to the tapes like and they were like i'm confused like he's not talking to me and i make him listen to the tapes and after he's done listening to the tapes he still doesn't talk to me right so like take a step back focus on one thing at a time recognize that it's okay if your life is a dumpster fire it's not actually a dumpster fire unless it's a dumpster fire you may feel like it's a dumpster fire but when you try to do everything all at once it feels overwhelming so take a step back focus on one damn thing at a time if you get bored of one thing focus on two you get bored of two focus on three don't go past three right so okay like this week i'm gonna try to get my job in order i'm gonna try to clean my house and i'm gonna pay my bills don't worry about exercise and sleep like if you need to eat fast food or frozen pizza eat fast food and frozen pizza don't worry about it your heart will be okay for like a week and then like do them one at a time and put your mind to it right like really focus on one thing if you want to focus on relationships then focus on relationships that's a good one because if you learn communication skills it'll help you at your job right cut yourself a break focus on like two or three things at a time and it's okay to not be perfect you don't have to be like life is not actually a race you don't have to be ahead of the pack i don't even know where the pack is like you know i don't know like people you know half the world is like not half but like a third of the world is like literally below the u.n poverty line right so like you're okay and if you're below if you're in that bottom third then like that's going to take some time to fix so cut yourself a break is the most important thing focus on like a couple things at a time and recognize this is like if they have one bit of wisdom that maybe people haven't heard before recognize that the way that you feel this way is because society is making you feel this way that doesn't necessarily mean it's true right because we live in a culture where we're bombarded by like people working on these things constantly so i see this a lot with people who are like spiritually hungry where they're like going to this retreat and going to that retreat and going like i need to be like more in touch with myself like i need to understand myself better like i need to learn how to forgive like i'm like i really need to learn how to forgive like i've been struggling to learn forgiveness for so long and then i realized like i can't forgive others unless i forgive myself because i read this book that talks about how forgiving others sorts of forgiving yourself and it's like bro if you're beating yourself up for not learning how to forgive you're like defeating the point like you guys get that it's like oh my god i can't forgive like forgive yourself for that why don't you say it's okay not to forgive and then like mind blown right it's okay to not forgive that's forgiveness so like we we get into this like cycle without even realizing it right it's like in this like wellness cycle where it's like oh i gotta work on this i gotta work on this i gotta work no you don't you don't actually have to work on it right you're allowed to be not a perfect child to your parents you're allowed to tell your parents you know what i just don't have the bandwidth for your bs right now i love you guys i just need to take a step back you're allowed to dodge phone calls you're allowed to do that even that what i just said requires a certain amount of like self-understanding and being able to communicate you're allowed to not answer the phone if someone that is stressing you out doesn't you know you don't have to answer it right now now if you have some kind of relationship at some point you don't want to like ghost them right you want to disappear off the face of the earth like send them a text message let them know you're doing okay but like you don't have to answer i just don't have the bandwidth for this right now so here's the concrete piece of advice i just don't have the bandwidth for this right now right so like that's something you need to learn to tell other people and learn to tell yourself it's okay just don't have the bandwidth for it right now that's fine right questions that's my wisdom it's like be aware of what society is doing to you and don't fall for it yeah there we go so out fair saying then i should have more bandwidth exactly right so i bet you if someone came up with a product that they claimed turn 24 hours of a day into 26 hours of a day someone would buy it someone was like we've discovered this supplement that alters the perception of time and the speeds up your neurons by 18 and allows you to get 26 hours out of a day instead of
