about a week ago i stubbed my toe against a table leg and boy did i get pissed off damn that table leg then i kicked the table leg for doing this to me and then i hurt more and then i felt more angry the despair of anger hi i've heavily i've heavily suppressed emotions throughout life with video games or simply by refusing to acknowledge the emotion slash pressing the mute button on it and i've started doing a lot of work to identify and feel my emotions good job friend i'm getting to a point where i'm comfortable with most emotions also good job friend and feeling them reliably but i have a complicated relationship with anger you and everyone else i come from a home where anger was the tyrant that made everyone miserable and i witnessed the effects it had on my mother and sister which made me promise myself never to feel angry as you might guess because our emotions are a mute all that wasn't a viable strategy and it led to a lot of pain for me that pain continues with my relationship to anger today i'm comfortable with the idea that i need anger is a healthy part of my life i want to know more about it and how to effectively handle it when it comes up but because of a lifetime of denying it i'm always at a loss how to become comfortable with it i sometimes still reflexively try to suppress it or deny it and when i do feel it and allow myself to feel it it's followed by guilt and intense self-judgment this relationship with anger is making me feel broken and helpless in regards to the feeling feeling like i'll be able to use it as a healthy tool it's supposed to be and that only adds more stress on top of the negative feelings i'm already experiencing do y'all have any guidance on this kind words or thoughts are also welcome thank you for your time fantastic post so the thing about anger is that it's different it's different from the other emotions we can come to accept things like sadness like getting in touch with your sadness is a good thing you know a parent who is sad is deserving of sympathy we understand oh my my mom is mom or dad is very anxious about me it's because they love me right that's the way they worry about me they worry because they love so if we look at all of our negative emotions a lot of them are acceptable except for anger a sad parent sympathy a worried parent oh we understand that's because you love your child an angry parent how dare you and like this person we see why anger is demonized right because anger makes people miserable we blame people for for being angry and so this becomes a challenge because then like how do we develop a relationship with anger we can understand developing a relationship with anxiety overcoming anxiety it's understandable that i'm anxious it's understandable that i'm sad when i turn to my friends and i say i'm having a rough day i'm super sad today i lost someone that i love i'm sad and the world is like oh like let me give you a hug but if i'm angry how does that what effect does that have on people around me and if you grow up in a household where you saw the danger of anger what happens is anger gets demonized right because anger is a dangerous emotion it's a bad emotion like oh sure like we can get in touch with our sadness oh my god like let's watch a sad movie and like all cry together and bond oh my god like i'm gonna have so much compassion and empathy for the sadness of the world and the starving children and the refugees and like oh my god it's so sad it makes me so sad everyone give me sympathy and empathy oh my god and if i'm having a trauma response because i've been traumatized in the past and i'm afraid of something that's not my fault i deserve compassion and love i'm afraid of this because i've been traumatized and as i share that i receive lots of support but not anger right and anger is kind of interesting because we also see this kind of i'm opening a little bit of a can of worms here but we also see in gender dynamics that anger is the one unacceptable emotion for everyone for both genders this is kind of interesting because if someone is at work and they're a woman and they're angry they get called the b word or the c word it's not acceptable can is a woman allowed to be afraid sure is a woman allowed to be sad sure but is a woman allowed to be angry no no right it's used as an attack also true for men i recently saw an article i didn't look at it was clickbait about this guy andrew tate which i keep on hearing about still not sure who he is and now he's mobilizing angry men not mobilizing sad men not mobilizing fearful men or anxious men angry men right i'm not trying to get into that but i'm just pointing out that like what's the word that we use angry men or evil men right anger is the unacceptable emotion i'm not commenting on whether he is or i don't really even know who he is or anything like that i'm just saying like i saw this article and i've observed that when we're even we're trying to bash both genders if we toss the word anger in there it's unacceptable right it's kind of interesting so that's what makes it universal it's not actually gender specific so we demonize anger because anger is the opposite of compassion compassion is like a good thing right we sort of like put those two all like kindness are angry kindness are angry so what happens it's really tricky because how do we develop a healthy relationship with this thing because anger isn't like the other emotions even freud sort of talked he has a lot of really interesting stuff to say about anger and one of i think this is his theory that depression is anger turned against the self so when i'm very depressed and i'm like oh i'm terrible i'm not a good person people deserve better you know people would be happier if i didn't exist all these kinds of thoughts that's all hatred against the self and so oftentimes what i've seen as a clinician is when people are depressed what it actually is is anger at its root freud was really brilliant with that observation so when we don't deal with our anger it manifests in all kinds of weird ways it can sometimes manifest as depression it can sometimes manifest as explosions right which once again then we blame ourselves because we explode at someone because we feel too much anger we've been suppressing it it's not really working out explosion and then we blame ourselves oh my god i got angry again i lost control of the anger do we blame people for breaking out crying no do we blame people for having a panic attack some people do and that's devastating how dare you have a panic attack we may perceive some things around those negative emotions like shame or weakness right that's fair but none of our emotions get vilified the way that anger does so how does one start to develop a healthy relationship with anger i'm going to give you all one really simple answer works really really well i've used it a ton so let's start from the top the first thing is to acknowledge that anger is different different for a lot of different reasons societally we're taught now as we become more in touch with ourselves emotionally as we start to accept that crying is okay for both men and women as we start to accept that anxiety is a problem people suffer from panic attacks people suffer from trauma we have a lot more compassion towards those emotions we don't have compassion towards anger blame we blame people for being angry and furthermore a lot of times the reason that we blame people is because we see the damage that anger causes other emotions cause damage too i once worked with someone he's going to be somewhat of a chimerical person who fell in love and fell in love with someone who wanted to have a child and they thought when two people are in love nicest thing that you can do if someone wants a child is to bring a child into this world a child that is born of love between two people just turns out the two people weren't married and that they were married to other people but it was love and love conquers all and love is a good emotion giving into love and like bringing a child in this world is a start as a source of love it's a wonderful thing except one of them had kids with someone else and was married right but we don't think about love as a bad emotional like love is great like love conquers all love conquers even your prior marriages and love conquers like the responsibilities that you have towards your existing children love conquers all but societally we don't look at that right like you look at all of your movies and love is a force for good and the villain is angry anger is always a part of the villain so we vilify anger so understand this within yourself now how do you develop a healthy relationship with anger it's one really simple thing you can do start by understanding that all emotions exist for a reason so if you can't forgive yourself for being angry because that's what a lot of people will try to do at the very beginning if you can't be compassionate understand that emotions are information first and foremost and start by asking yourself what is the anger telling me what is the anger saying because if we don't want to judge ourselves for being angry we have to understand it we have to listen to it doesn't mean follow what it wants you to do listening to it means literally listening to it or not i guess metaphorically listening to it it doesn't mean following its direction because anger like why have human beings all human beings are capable of exhibiting anger feeling anger why is this conserved through human evolution it's because anger is a useful emotion and the place to start if you have a judgmental relationship with anger is with information and understanding so often times anger manifests as a sign of something like disrespect so as you ask as you start to feel angry instead of suppressing it ask yourself you know what what am i angry about what is the anger telling me and then you may find something that's really really important which is that oh i'm being disrespected or i'm being treated unfairly or i feel like i'm being treated unfairly and that's really really important because i want you all to consider two situations one is where you suppress the anger and you are being disrespected and as you suppress that what's going to happen you're not going to address the disrespect you will continue operating in that situation as you continue operating in that situation you will continue to be disrespected as you continue to be disrespected you will continue to squash down the anger and your life will not improve and you will suffer through every minute of it and the more angry you feel because you push it down and you continue to get disrespected the more you're going to beat yourself up and the more you beat yourself up the more you will allow yourself to be disrespected it's going to be a vicious cycle in the wrong direction which is exactly why anger explodes because we suppress it right and we sort of know that suppressed anger explodes so anger is a useful form of information and as we listen to our anger as we start to recognize okay where are you coming from it starts to build a healthy relationship with it because now you're not judging it you're not squashing it down you're not giving into it and letting it explode you're listening to it what is the information that you're trying to give me and oftentimes anger is a response to hurt right so if you think about what's the most basic form of anger that people reliable form of people that anger experience it's when they get hurt it's a protection against hurt so if i like you know i'll give you all a great example so about a week ago i stubbed my toe against a table leg and boy did i get pissed off damn that table leg then i kicked the table leg for doing this to me and then i hurt more and then i felt more angry right so like if you all have ever gotten angry at an inanimate object i think there's like a great subreddit about this stupid people fighting things or something right like when you get angry and like think about that doesn't make any sense it's not the table legs fault but it's a natural human reaction when we get hurt to feel angry and if you want to understand how baked in it has nothing to do with other people it's all just the way that we're wired all you got to do is stub your toe and you'll see how anger is a response to her so once again ask yourself when you're feeling angry how was i hurt and get to the source of that because what tends to happen when we see these abusive angry households what's usually happening is those parents that are abusive or angry or explode aren't in touch with what the anger is telling them and so they displace that anger onto other people they don't acknowledge their own hurt so when i've worked with people who have things like diagnoses like antisocial personality disorder which is like kind of like sociopathy or when i worked with people in jail when i worked with criminals what i tend to find is that a lot of them are angry and the reason that they're angry is because they've been hurt in some way so if you want to develop a healthy relationship with your anger start to ask yourself about how have you been hurt what is the hurt that underlies this anger because anger is just a source of information we're not saying embrace it we're not saying love it we're not saying because you're not ready for that yet the first step for 99 of people that i've worked with is to understand what anger is trying to tell them and hopefully you'll know this very simple principle that when someone is heard when someone listens to you when someone feels heard and listened to the emotion goes down and then you'll be able to develop a relationship you'll be able to control it even then controlling really isn't the goal living with it is the goal but it'll decompress it some and then you'll start to form a healthy relationship with anger and you'll start to realize that your anger is only looking out for you just like all of your other emotions right we have these emotions because they're evolutionarily advantageous so if you want to build a healthy relationship with anger really really challenging because society treats anger unlike all of the other negative emotions it's the only emotion that is almost universally demonized vilified right and even if you look at these hero these movies where like the hero is on his quest for vengeance or she's on her quest for vengeance when a hero or heroine is on their quest for vengeance what do they do at the end they forgive compassion anger doesn't take it all the way to the end it's always compassion at the end so we treat anger differently it's the only thing that we don't allow ourselves to feel it's the only thing that we judge ourselves for feeling and so if you want to start to develop a healthy relationship with anger start by asking yourself where is this coming from what are you trying to tell me because all emotions are sources of information they're ways that your brain processes different experiences that you have as you start listening to it and we're just going to be curious right we're not giving into it because that's too dangerous we're just going to listen to it that non-judgmentalness that listening that communication is what's going to form the foundation of building a healthy relationship with anchor so someone's asking about stoicism so let's talk about stoicism for a second so i i i'm not an expert on stoicism like i've read meditations my marcus aurelius i've been told by other people that marcus aurelius is not the best stoic philosopher i'm not an expert on philosophy but i think the key thing about stoicism at least from my understanding of it is not in the absence of feeling it it's in the control of the reaction to it which is exactly what the buddhist and hindu traditions say right so this is where like if you look at these eastern philosophies they don't emotions are a part of life it's in our reaction to it that we success is good or bad so virtue is not in in an absence of feeling it it's not the goal is that numbness right so if you look at like eastern perspectives the goal is acceptance it's not denial which is what suppressing anger does it's about accepting your emotions so i think stoicism is basically i want to say it's very similar it's sort of acknowledging that you're allowed to feel that way but not letting that thing control you and you retaining control of the emotion as opposed to the other way around um so how do you deal with other people's anger even if it's not aimed at you my reaction is typically fear so that's a great question so how do you deal with anger in other people my reaction is fear so the control that you should exert is in your reaction so and this works in a sense really well although it's very scary so if someone is being angry with you and they're behaving with you inappropriately how do you manage their anger you don't manage their anger you manage your own fear so what happens when people deal with other people's anger is they walk on eggshells oh no i don't want to make them angry i don't want to make them angry and in doing so you breed bad behavior because when they get angry you accommodate so the right way to deal with other people's anger is to actually not be controlled by your fear and if someone says something inappropriately whether they're gonna blow up or not you face them with strength you don't face them with fear you say hey i understand you're angry right now but what you're saying is completely unacceptable you need to tone it down a notch if you need to go take a walk go take a walk i care about you i love you but your behavior is completely unacceptable you want to do it calm you don't want to give on to your own anger you don't want to give in to your fear you don't want to admit mistakes that you didn't make that's how you deal with other people's anger and the interesting thing is there's like tons of research on this on boundary setting and there's even a book on borderline personality disorder called walking on eggshells which talks about how when you are dealing with people with bpd the more boundaries you allow them to cross the worse the behaviors and the explosions and things like that become so like dealing with other people's anger is about setting appropriate boundaries and not reacting to your own fear now there are a couple of important caveats to this which is that you may exist in an environment where you can't set boundaries and there's an inherent power dynamic right so like if i'm like 15 years old and i have an abusive parent who gets really really angry and i try to set boundaries with them and it just doesn't work because they're physically stronger than i am they have financial control over me and things like that that's a really challenging situation you'd be surprised though at how far that can go right and and it's even saying something like i understand that you're my dad and you hit me because you think you can i do not think when you hit me it makes you a good parent i do not think it teaches me the right lessons i'm really curious what are you trying to accomplish by doing this and that's the kind of thing that if you tell to a parent may make them angry but if you manage your tone properly and stuff like that i have seen progress in those kinds of situations because oftentimes parents aren't evil right they lose control of their anger and like even pointing out to parents that what you're doing hurts me do you understand that is that your intention is your goal to try to hurt me so like these are hard words to say to people in power dynamics but like sometimes that's what you got to do and if you can't do that or that's unsafe then unfortunately the only thing is like bide your time or seek like you know safe haven resources i'm not suggesting that you challenge someone who has a power dynamic over you but if you're asking what the right answer is that's what i think the right answer is sometimes you got to be smart about it right it's like biding your time until you can leave the house and then never look back how do you deal with anger once you've become independent you do not let guilt win that's how you deal with anger once you become independent if you've been dependent on someone who's angry with you do you all understand that you buy your time play it safe don't challenge them and then gtfo and once you gtfo and they no longer have power over you their tune will change come home for christmas no i'm not going to do that why are you mad at me because you've been physically abusive that was in the past it still hurts i'm sorry i'm i'm confused what are you expecting that to do when you say i'm sorry what effect do you think that that has i'm curious when did you start to become sorry like for the years that the abuse went on did you feel sorry uh yeah of course then why didn't you do something about it uh it was hard for me okay the damage is done right like don't let like this is the other i know it's kind of we're moving off topic here but how do you deal with anger you don't give in to the other emotions whether it's fear or guilt or anything like that i'm feeling angry just talking about it because i'm thinking about all the people so this is like good right so now i'm feeling angry and we're going to meditate in a second i'm feeling angry because i've worked with a lot of people who are in y'all's shoes who have been in unfair power dynamics and it makes me so angry that those people were taken advantage of and so i'm listening to that anger and i'm using that to help me speak because if you're out there and you're listening to this like i'm speaking for you i don't even know if that makes any sense right and anger isn't a negative it's not a bad thing and if you've been treated unfairly and you feel angry about it and there's an unfair power dynamic like i do believe that if you act in a right way you will get some degree of peace and closure and sometimes that peace and closure means severing a relationship with someone having that person want a relationship and then slamming the door in their face and then you're gonna feel guilty and then you're not gonna give in to that and you're gonna tell yourself that like it's okay for me to feel guilty but this person does not deserve a relationship with me they had their chance well i'm sorry like you should forgive let me explain something to y'all no one should forgive forgiveness is not entitled to anyone forgiveness is purely at the discretion of the aggrieved party no one is owed forgiveness you
