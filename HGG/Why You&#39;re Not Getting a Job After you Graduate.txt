i didn't learn anything there's so much i don't know i'm so incompetent no instead of what you say is here's here are the skills that i learned i'm proficient in a b and c and you've got to be prepared in something if you've got a portfolio here are the six things that i'm really hoping to learn because i think they'd really enhance my ability to like make graphics all that stuff that you don't know okay i feel like i won't be employable when i graduate right now right so i'm a graphic design student and i mean you know the how the jokes of the unemployed art student go but even if i have trouble finding a job due to mostly external reasons i think i can cope with it if things are looking pessimistic i can accept lower paying jobs and move towns etc not an insanely big deal however the thing is that my university doesn't really teach us how to design they just give us projects and make us try our best it's too late for me to transfer and i'm honestly very frustrated with my uni but you may say why don't you teach yourself how to design that's the thing when i tried to do that i barely had time for the insane workload i was given it's always a balancing act between learning the basics of what you're in uni for and doing assignments i just don't know what to do any anymore there's so many things i don't know and i don't trust myself to learn them over the summer as the past two were spent being depressed in my home i'm already picturing the crappy state of my portfolio as i try to apply for jobs no one cares if it's because my uni is a uni a job is a job i'm already seeing this now as i struggle at my work internship and i honestly feel horrible like a mix of self-hate and incredible frustration towards my uni i seriously don't know what to do okay so this unfortunately is a problem that i've seen a lot during especially covid so what's happening is i've seen a lot of university students feeling more and more pessimistic about their opportunities their work opportunities after college so a lot of people are feeling like really really you know not good about this so what i'm seeing a lot of is that sometimes we have college students who are like afraid that their university is not preparing them the way that they're supposed to be universities aren't teaching right especially with like online school and stuff like that like it's been really hard because the quality of education that most people are getting is going down furthermore they're so busy and or so mentally burnt out that the independent learning that they should be doing to fix things is like just so hard because they're either mentally burnt out or there's a lot of busy work or other crap like that so it's sort of like you're placed in this situation you can't transfer you're not getting the skills that you need you don't have time to teach yourself the stuff and so you're kind of just like doomed right and there's this kind of attitude that people have that i'm screwed because i'm not going to be employable and like i can see you know it's sort of like you're you're on a train that's headed towards a cliff and you can see the cliff coming you can see that there's a there's a railroad there's like railroad tracks that are going straight towards the cliff like you can't change direction you can't slow down the train you're like committed and like they're they're there's the cliff and you're kind of screwed so it can be very very very scary for people to like be in this situation where they feel like they're not getting adequately prepared the tricky thing here is that there are a couple of different pieces to this puzzle that we have to consider in order to understand how to navigate towards like becoming employable the first is it's kind of weird but where is your idea of how employable you are right so the first question you've got to ask yourself is how qualified are you to know how employable you are so this person was kind of saying i have a crappy portfolio i can envision the piece of crap portfolio that i'm putting together whereas you have to really stop for a second and think a little bit about like do you know what people who are looking for entry-level you know graphic design artists are looking for right so you're going to get your first job out of college like what are they looking for what are the requirements how much of what you actually do in the workplace do you even learn in college right so let's kind of start there for a second because the truth is that chances are you're actually going to be totally fine and we'll get to that in a second but like most people you know who are hiring for the first time understand that you're coming right out of college most people also understand in the workplace that when you hire someone out of college what really college is for is or unity is for is developing a foundation upon which you build your skills so just as an example like you know in medical school is intense right so medical school is like four years and it's there's a lot to learn in medical school you're studying a ton and you probably learn like i probably learned like five to ten percent of what i use as a psychiatrist in medical school in the next four years during residency you learn like 95 of psychiatry so it's kind of bizarre but that's true for a lot of other professions too and graphic design i think is generally speaking in a sense no different is that people know that you know if you're out of college you're out of college you're not going to be expected to be perfect so then the question kind of comes in like then why does this person feel this way right where are these thoughts coming from where is the pessimism coming from and let's kind of take a second look at the post and kind of highlight a few things okay so jokes of unemployment right at the start um if things are looking pessimistic so this seems kind of optimistic right doesn't teach us how to design they give us projects but they don't really teach me anything i don't know what to do they feel like they're learning the basics they kind of spent some time depressed at home i'm already picturing the crappy state of my portfolio as i try to apply to jobs no one cares right like i'm already seeing this now as i struggle at my work internship and honestly i feel horrible so this is kind of tricky but and this is something i've seen a lot during the pandemic like i said so i'm going to point out to you all a little bit about what's going on in the mind and how this person is coming to conclusions so if you're someone that thinks that you're not prepared for the job market you have to remember that your mind is making that conclusion right but how qualified is your mind and what is your mind influenced by let's take a look so if you feel if you're a college student who feels unprepared let's start to understand a couple things one is how qualified are you to know your employability second thing is where does your mind get the idea that you're unemployable okay so first thing is that you're not really very qualified because like how many people have you interviewed for design positions do you know what companies look for when they're hiring are you part of hr if you you know like you don't know right like i know it's kind of weird but like you have no idea what people are looking for and actually this person seems quite attractive uh in terms of a lot of the things that they're doing so this is kind of weird but like the short answer is like you're not you're not an expert in like desiring uh hiring graphic designers you have no idea what people are looking for so we're not saying that you aren't uh maybe maybe you should be pessimistic i don't know but let's just start by sort of understanding if you're a college student you have no idea what people who are like actually hiring or looking for the skill set that matters to them things like that you just don't know right so you're just first thing is you know how qualified are you the answer is not very so if you're not very qualified why are you freaking out right and it turns out there's a really good reason for this so in college especially like pre-pandemic so in college what we get what a big part of college is developing confidence and what i've seen more and more often is that like this confidence kind of comes from things like grades it comes from being you know a junior or senior and working like being a ta for freshmen for example right so like comes from grades comes from junior senior comes from generally speaking like learning more advanced things over time it also comes from feedback from peers and professors so this is really important right because a lot of confidence isn't actually learning the on on the job stuff it's like learning things like work ethic deadlines this is really what college is about and then we get these different kinds of things that give us confidence so here's what i've noticed during the pandemic during online schooling so as more programs move to online these kinds of confidence developing things get decreased because you're not interacting with freshmen as much you're not quite a ta even if you are a ta if it's online you don't really form relationships with people it's kind of like you're just kind of reviewing work and stuff like that so what's happening is that as our as our college situation and our pandemic situation changes i'm noticing a global decrease in the amount of confidence that people have coming out of college okay and then this is creating further problems so once you lack confidence now we're answering this question a little bit better so once we determine that we lack confidence then what happens is our mind concludes we are screwed now is this person applied for a job no do they know what employers are looking for no and yet their mind still comes to the conclusion that they're screwed but where does that that conclusion stem from it stems from a lack of confidence i'm not blaming this person for doing that that's what happens to everyone right so unless we're given confidence through some of these reinforcing measures unless one of your professors because i think this is the problem they're faced it's like their professors are too mentally checked out they're not saying hey you're doing a really great job what i'm not hearing from this person at all is anywhere in here someone telling them hey you're doing good a good job you're doing great you're managing the workload i know it's a lot we're not seeing any positive reinforcement and when there's an absence of positive reinforcement in our college experience or in any other part of life that leads to lack of confidence it's not a personal failing on this this person's part it's like it's not their job to be naturally confident confidence comes from the reinforcement of people who are more experienced than you are and in the absence of that they're going to naturally end up with a lack of confidence then they're going to conclude that they're screwed this in turn is going to activate the ahamkar right so remember ahamkara a-h-a-m-k-a-r-a the sanskrit word for ego is a defensive mechanism that arises to protect you when you are feeling bad so when we lack confidence the ahamkar activates a hum card to the rescue and then the hum car unfortunately does a couple things that can be weird one is it makes comparisons right so how does this person know that their portfolio is going to look like trash it's because they've looked at other portfolios right so even if you look at this how does this person okay so that's the thing what um so like it's always a balance act between learning the basics of what you're in uni and doing assignments i don't know what to do anyway there's so many things i don't know right so they're like they're aware that there are a lot of things that they don't know yet they're they're aware of the growth that they need to have that's actually really healthy we'll see that in a second but all they're focusing on they're not focusing on the things that they they do know and all the things that they've learned they're not focusing on the fact that they've successfully completed assignments what the hum guard is going to do when we lack confidence when we have the ahamkar this is going to result in cognitive distortions okay these cognitive distortions are all going to be negative in nature so they're going to focus on all the things that you don't know because you're not even going to appreciate you're so buried with all your workload that you're actually doing that you don't even appreciate how much you've learned because all you've felt week after week month after month after month is that you're like alone in the ocean stranded by yourself with no sense of feedback right you're trying to navigate through fog and you can't see anything so of course you're gonna feel lost because you're not getting any feedback from anyone this in turn is going to result in i'm unemployable because you're going to look at all the other people you're going to go look at like design portfolios of professionals who have websites and you're going to compare your crappy design portfolio to theirs and then you're going to conclude oh wow look at how awesome that person is forget the fact that they have like eight years of experience you're going to conclude i'm unemployable because this is my competition now this is where things get really tricky because once you start looking for a job with this attitude what do you think this attitude is gonna do in terms of shaping the job that you get here's what's gonna happen okay first thing that's gonna happen is you're going to avoid the best jobs okay you're going to avoid the best jobs for sure because you're on there's no way that this person would hire you right because you're unemployable so the first thing that you're going to do is knock out the 50 of jobs that are awesome or like not awesome that are that are good right so the top 50 so let's say here's all the jobs that you can get this is the perfect job this is the shittiest job that you can get the first thing that you're going to do is x out this so now all that's left is the bottom half next thing that's going to happen is like when you go in interview places because of your lack of like confidence in yourself you're going to naturally attract toxic workplaces i know it's kind of weird but this is almost a situation kind of like when you have been abused growing up you look for partners that will continue to abuse you because it's like it feels right right even if it's not good for you it feels right so when someone when you go to an interview and someone cheats you with a little bit of disrespect or they're like yeah you know i don't know if you actually have what it takes but we'll give you a chance that's actually going to align with your internal sense of self so you'll be like oh like these people like know what to expect from me so let me work there so over time what you're going to do is you're also going to shoot yourself in the foot in terms of negotiations and because you think as you think so little of yourself you lack that confidence right and so like what you're gonna end this is this is what gets really tricky so when when i say toxic workplace why do i say toxic because someone with more confidence would be able to walk away from like mistreatment during the hiring process right someone with more confidence who recognizes the value they bring to the table if a boss is like are you willing to work nights and weekends and not get paid for it are you willing to get me coffee and like someone with confidence is going to be like no whereas like you if you're worried right so look look at how much they're already willing to compromise against themselves to make it work right self-compromise you're gonna shoot yourself in the foot you're gonna compromise right it's tricky then what's going to happen this is the worst thing they're going to get a job it's going to be toxic they're going to burn out and then what is this going to do reinforce their original beliefs i knew it i knew i was unemployable i knew i was unemployable now you're burnt out now you can't even work right we're back to the summer where where is this they gave us uh why don't you teach yourself it's a balancing act yeah like i barely had time for the workload i was given like burning out can't learn stuff during the summer the summer is supposed to be a break right it's not supposed to be where you learn you knew it i told you so your mind is like hey your hum car was like i warned you about this buddy i tried to protect you by telling you that you shouldn't expect to get a job look at you dumbass thought you could get a job becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy right and then then the cycle just repeats now you make more compromises it's tough right this is what our mind does i'm i don't think that i think this person is awesome for the record but that's what our mind does all right so like like we we see this a lot where like our mind will tell it like warn us hey don't try and then when we try our mind is like i told you so why did you bother i tried to protect you from this you should have never applied for the job in the first place and then we end up getting stuck because we don't want to like our mind is like don't apply for the job don't apply for the job i'm so anxious i tried to change my life and i got smacked down we can sometimes start to form negative opinions about the world oh then like all workplaces are toxic right like all kinds of things can come out of that so here's the crazy thing i think you are very employable why because you are self-directed you get your stuff done without guidance or support you have humility maybe a little bit too much you know what you don't know a couple of other things that i'm sort of picking up here is that you're isolated so here's what i'd say we're going to kind of start at the end and we're going to work our way backwards okay when you apply for a job you can say hey i have a design degree from this i've completed this many projects i'm highly self-directed so unfortunately the university i had didn't have a whole lot of hand-holding like they just sort of gave us projects and they were like figure it out so the funny thing is like this is how a graphic designer works in the real world now right so like we even employ them at hg like we employ designers and like self-direction is huge because what happens is someone comes to you and they're like hey we want you to make this thing and then it's like up to you to figure it out right like companies are going to hire you so that you can do it so you're actually perfect this is great if you had a bunch of handholding like oddly enough i'd be more worried about you in the job market your university experience actually mirrors what a lot of like work experiences can be like this is great it's a huge thing sucks for you don't get me wrong i'm not saying that like i wish i didn't wish things were different for you it'd be really nice if especially people could give you feedback that's what i think is really missing um but you're like you're self-directed you can manage project timelines you are good at like learning skills on the fly right so this is what i would say like in in your application so i put together your portfolio don't worry about how crappy it is because it's it can only be so good right and you're like people understand you're new at this so like this is where what you kind of like this is what how you spin it so you can just say look so i'm good at managing project timelines i'm self-directed i have a list of stuff that i'd like to learn more about that i didn't get a chance to learn in university so you have to change the way you say things right you didn't say i didn't learn anything there's so much i don't know i'm so incompetent no instead of what you say is here's here are the skills that i learned i'm proficient in a b and c and you've got to be proficient in something if you've got a portfolio here are the six things that i'm really hoping to learn because i think they'd really enhance my ability to like make graphics all that stuff that you don't know right i and i'm good at learning skills that are needed and i'm good at managing my own work i went to university that was actually i wish i had a little bit more structure now here's the cool thing you're also going to be careful about where you work because you're isolated so when when people at the job interview this is where the lack of confidence comes in people the job interview are like do you have any questions for us if you lack confidence and you're not selective you're going to say you're going to ask some generic question that you googled what questions should i ask in a job interview instead you are going to be very careful about the questions that you ask so you're going to ask them what is like the community environment here at your workplace do people work sort of siloed or do they work like together okay and you're gonna pick the place if you're feeling isolated that people collaborate you can even tell them i'm really interested in collaborating with other designers to learn from other people and share what i have is that something that i'll get to do here you want to know that ahead of time okay second thing is what are the learning opportunities because remember the problem you need to fix is this right you don't trust yourself to learn them so what you're going to look for in a workplace is i'm really interested in structured learning opportunities or opportunities to learn these particular things like and how does that come across to your your prospective employer the way you come across is not like demanding or ignorant in fact it comes across like the exact opposite way hey this is someone who's actually like interested in like learning more and they're kind of you kind of come across as a go-getter it's going to increase your esteem for most employers right you'll get that and so suddenly like with this situation you're actually a pretty strong candidate if your portfolio sucks it sucks but like you have no idea if it sucks or not right you have no idea what an entry level designer should be capable of i i don't know i i can't judge that maybe it does i i just don't know but i guess based on the mental stuff that i see here your cognitive bias is actually making your work appear far worse than it is okay so i know it's kind of weird but this is the last step before you do that um what you need to do is offset your emotions okay so like you need to do some like internal processing here and really think a little bit about answering these questions where does my lack of confidence come from right what does it feel like to be a student at this university what would have to happen or have to be different for me to feel confident and now now this is kind of interesting so this is like a tricky question that you can get trapped by a lot so what's what your cognitive distorted mind may say is learn all that stuff if i knew how to do all that stuff if i had a really beautiful portfolio then i would be confident but those aren't real goals i know it sounds kind of weird but that's not like a real thing you can do right it's just sort of like this weird vague idea of i'll be confident when i'm confident like having a beautiful portfolio what does that even mean like how do you measure whether your portfolio is is beautiful so this is tricky where your mind will say oh if i had a brilliant portfolio then i'd be confident but that's kind of like your mind is setting you up for a task that can only fail because how do you have a beautiful portfolio who measures that how can you move one percent towards a beautiful portfolio how can you grind 10 15 20 towards a beautiful portfolio you can't that's it's an unachievable goal now for those particular skills you can pick one and start to learn it but be careful so what do y'all think is gonna happen if this person picks a skill and starts to learn it do you think this will increase their confidence or decrease their confidence tricky [Music] right now do you think this will actually increase their marketability or decrease their marketability it'll increase their marketability if they learn a skill but it'll decrease their confidence okay now hold on a second hold on a second hold on hold on if this is the situation that they're in what do you think that says about the relationship between their confidence and their marketability uh-oh it's almost as if the two were are inversely proportional right so as the confidence goes down the marketability goes up so skill acquisition is our x-axis right and then so like the funny thing is they could be right here which actually means they're quite marketable and lacking confidence which is how we get to this post you'll see that so you have to be really really careful about how your mind works because sometimes your mind will like sort of have the opposite effect that you think it's going to have okay so you gotta process those emotions and then hopefully over time what i i'd say is that last thing to kind of consider is that like let me just think about this if i did this right so yeah employability offset your emotions yeah and what i'd really try to do is get some feedback so this is going to be really important so a lot of times people in this situation who lack confidence avoid feedback they avoid it okay and why is that it's because you're afraid that someone else is gonna tell you what you believe could be true about yourself but as long as you don't hear it from them like you could be wrong right so when you ask for feedback what you're actually taking away is hope unless you get feedback like there's the hope like so it's kind of tricky because when you ask someone else what they think of you it's so it's so difficult but this is the problem is that like you're kind of stuck now because the confidence is actually going to come from positive reinforcement from other people to a certain degree i know we've sort of said that it comes from within but that's a little bit more complicated and so now you're kind of tricky but like i'd say start getting feedback because if we're really talking about your employability you should like you need to get feedback because that's really what's going to fix it and be aware that you're going to be afraid of what they're going to say so just be aware of that kind of going in right that's where we have to kind of offset your emotions and this is where like offsetting your emotions this is where like going to therapy you could work with a coach you could talk to friends you could do introspection go for hikes right but just like get the f off the internet and don't just compare yourself to random portfolios for people who have paid people to have really strong seo right because like if you're googling portfolios like there's gonna be all kinds of factors that go into that you're not getting a fair sample when you google a portfolio google knows which portfolios are the most attractive to look at so it's going to show you this the top .0001 of portfolios on the internet right like there's all kinds of crap that is going into your cognitively distorted head and search engines are not helping right so got to be careful about that so offset your emotions and get some feedback right so ask people hey what can what here's my portfolio would you be willing to take a look what improvements do you think i can make to make myself more marketable for my first job it's a question you can ask your professors make sense so you got to get feedback and the other wild thing may happen when you get feedback actually i think it's pretty good i think you're well positioned for an entry-level graphic design job and then boy one of two things will happen so if you get good feedback oh boy what a mess if you get good feedback one of two things will happen one is you'll gain confidence i'd give this a 25 chance the other thing that'll happen is mental gymnastics to convince yourself that you are unemployable 75 and what does this look like he's just saying that because they are my professor you'll get that or it can manifest in other ways what it could do is he says oh yeah overall they look really fantastic i'd consider adding more color then what your mind is going to do is ignore the positive and jump to the negative and really pay attention pay attention right because that's what this bad boy is going to do so just be pay attention pay attention to what they actually say right so it's tricky so get some feedback manage your emotions because you want to go in like not feeling like you're the worst person on the planet because if you enter the job search that way it's going to be tough it's hard enough as it is even for someone who's who's confident right there could be all kinds of other stuff like imposter syndrome is huge here um and then ultimately i think you know you may be more employable than you give yourself credit for so just to kind of summarize you know i know it's tricky because a lot of times we feel like especially as college students like we lack the feedback with the pandemic and with more online learning and some of these degrees like graphic design that are a little bit more siloed like as college students it's like really hard to be confident about your job prospects pile on top of that like everything you're seeing about how the world is falling apart and it's just food for your cognitive distortions and then your cognitive distortions get really really really big you lose your confidence and then your lack of confidence plus your ego which sort of arises in as a result then creates conclusions for you that you're not really qualified to make like you have no idea what an intro level graphic design person is looking for right and remember there's that that famous joke or whatever about you know the the there's like a famous piano teacher let's say and they have two students that come to them and one is like hey i'd like to learn piano and they'd say okay how much experience do you have and they say i've never played a piano in my life they're like great i'll charge you 100 bucks a week the second person comes along and they say i want to learn piano from you and they say okay how much how much experience do you have and they said i've i have five years of experience great i'm going to charge you 300 bucks a week and they said well wait hold on but i i already know how to do half of it why are you charging me more and they're like yeah well like i have to i teach you to unlearn a bunch of crap so i have to like wipe your slate clean whereas this person's slate is already clean there are a lot of jobs that really just prefer good especially for intro level positions really are looking for good work ethic and good self-direction they'll teach you what you need to know or they want you to do things in a particular style anyway so you have no idea how employable you are but your lack of confidence will convince you despite the fact that you have no objective information you have no experience hiring intro level graphic designers so you don't really know what they look for but your mind doesn't tell you that it's ignorant right instead what does the lack of confidence will start coming up with answers for you it'll tell you hey you're screwed and we see this a lot in online learning pandemic related stuff siloed fields because you don't get that kind of feedback and confidence from your peers from your professors things like that so at the end of the day you've got to be careful because if that lack of confidence is what's in the driving seat when you look for a job first thing is you're going to ignore all the best jobs that you those may have been the right places for you because with your work ethic and the right kind of community maybe you could have really knocked it out of the park but you're not going to apply for those because you don't think you you're going to get them reminds me of my first research assistant position at harvard medical school which i got because i was the only applicant i applied for 140 positions and the ones that were at the medium level universities had the most competition and some of the most like this is like a glut of mediocrity for jobs sometimes where the most competitive jobs don't actually get as many candidates as like the medium competitiveness jobs right bizarre because everyone was like oh i don't think i can get the job there oh this feels right to me this is like a better fit oh wow these people are paying 75 000. i don't i thought i'm only worth 50. let me apply for the 51. so you got to be careful about that kind of stuff so you may end up being more employable than you realize and if you're not careful you're going to select through a selection bias you're going to pick for worse jobs and then even in the interview process you're going to gravitate towards toxic workplaces that treat you the way that you feel about yourself because then it's like then there's no imposter syndrome you'll get that if you end up in a toxic workplace that treats you like crap and you feel like crap you're not gonna feel like an imposter it's gonna feel at least it's fits whereas if they treat you really well because you're grossly misunderestimating your value you're gonna feel like an imposter you're like i don't understand like i'm not i don't know that much why are these people treating me so well they're saying i'm doing a good job and it's going to take you a little while for that to sink in that maybe you're actually work worth something so what you got to do in order to overcome this is first of all recognize that you may be more employable than you realize you have a lot of good stuff going for you right you're self-directed you're interested in learning you're you want to do a good job you've completed a lot of projects it sounds like you can handle high workloads so i would emphasize all that kind of stuff right that you're a workhorse you're self-directed you're interested in learning and you've got to offset those emotions and focus on that confidence recognize where all these thoughts coming from they're coming from some emotional place and so like dig into that and work on that because you don't want that to be front and center when you go looking for the job and the last thing is as terrifying as it is get some actual feedback from people who can advise you about like what how you can strengthen your portfolio or how to start building one and the fact that you're thinking about it it sounds like you don't have one yet it's actually perfect so what you can even ask your professors like what makes a good portfolio or ask people who are like if there's like a job placement department at your university ask them like how does one build a strong portfolio and get some actual answers from people who may know more and then start moving towards that and be aware though because there's one really tricky thing that we don't want to uh forget one tricky tricky a lot of traps here but this is the main trap is that even if you get good feedback sorry even if you get good feedback so recognize this that as you start to improve and as you start to build your portfolio you may get this discrepancy between confidence and marketability that the better you're doing your mind may tell you that you're doing worse and even if you get good feedback there's going to be another kind of mental trick here where your mind may try to convince you that the feedback is not actually valid even though you're the one that asked for it so be careful about those two little tricks okay you
