and so the tricky thing though is that like this translation that zell alluded to that there's like there may be some amount of scientific truth out there but when it comes to applying it to our individual situation like that's where things get tricky and there we go okay hey welcome everyone how's everybody doing today i'm good thank you good good i'm glad finally it's nice to have you um so welcome everyone to week three so i noticed we have a new face so i think we should go ahead and probably do introductions but before we do introductions let's actually start to think about um so we'll have ms ashrox introduce herself and then what we're gonna do as the group is try to orient her to what we're doing here so if y'all remember a little bit about like what the scope of this is what the goal of this is what our responsibilities are because i'm sure you all can imagine it can be a little bit strange to come in you know after we've gotten started but you're still totally in the early phase so it's like not a big deal at all so um what we ask in terms of introductions is why don't we go ahead and introduce ourselves and then um we can share a little bit about what's you know where people can find us so like what kind of streaming we do what kind of content creation we do and um if there's anything in particular that you want to work on over the next few weeks we can sort of share that as well so i'll go ahead and you want you want to start sure why not welcome in everybody to the you know beautiful massage rocks all right welcome no i'm kidding but um i'm miss hatchbacks i'm a twitch partner twitch ambassador i've been streaming for six years now it's been a very long time and i usually play video games that's my main form of content but i'm diving into more lifestyle mental health and i'm really excited for everything that has to come so usually i stream late nights because i work full time at tiltify as their community manager so that's where you'll catch me in a daytime on their twitch channel talking with different charities and different fundraisers and for the next few weeks i want to prioritize understanding my feelings more and how to combat imposter syndrome because that's what i've been struggling with lately so that's my goal and i'm happy to be here thank you so much for having me welcome thank you so much for being here who's going next uh i can go next um so hello everyone uh my name is michael otherwise known as smirky um i've been a decade-long content creator uh lgbtqia plus variety streaming specialized in a game called toontown which used to be a former disney mmo alongside games like club penguin and pirates of the caribbean online and like back back during your early childhood if if you know you know um but basically um i love playing games with other people multiplayer games interactive experiences with a bit of sprinkle in single-player you know games and a variety of genres as well whether it's like a party game or rpg game or anything like that um and i also do a bit of charity work as well and i fundraise on platforms like tiltify um to raise money for lots of amazing causes that are important to our community um and uh yeah uh that's all i can think of saying right now so i'll just keep it short and sweet like that cool okay next or no you got it if you want do i sound okay i didn't get to do an audio check i do okay i'm good uh hi i'm metric seconds reporting live from stolen wi-fi outside of a pharmacy um i uh recently damaged a tendon in my foot and walking has not been fun um so my folks helped me with it and that's why i'm not home but uh i've been streaming for almost six years and specialize in strategy games especially darkest dungeon recently switched to variety and yeah overall feeling the burnout from doing one game a lot and kind of trying to figure out where to go from there so great hello my name is ruby true and i stream um wellness mindfulness kind of content um i stream asmr and sound baths um yeah if it's relaxing and it's chill then it's basically my jam and um yeah considering the content i stream i i was thinking about this earlier this week i want to say stop saying i suffer with or struggle with i have anxiety um and adhd i don't struggle or suffer with either of them that's something i'm really working on saying out loud and uh yeah just learning to manage those things and help other people have good lives and manage those things themselves that's my aim cool okay um what's up i'm zell uh i am a streamer slash youtube person um most people have seen me from various things like offline tv or all chat back when that was a show at uh riot games and i have done work in the magic the gathering space as well and um been featured on uh youtube channels like the command zone um for my personal stream i stream video games uh i talk a lot about anime uh that's like my thang i guess uh but then yeah uh stuff that i want to work on basically everything but uh i think you know i'm just here to get a little bit more grounded and and stuff and like i'm somebody who is always doing a lot of different things and maybe uh i should be focusing on specializing more um so yeah that's uh that's that's me awesome okay so thank you all very much for introduction so my name is olik i'm known as dr k i'm a psychiatrist by training um and i stream on healthygamergg we do a lot of mental health related content and the reason i started streaming was because i noticed that i was having the same conversation in my office over and over and over again and that that conversation wasn't actually clinical so it was like teaching 40 people like the same general concepts and and so i just had the question about you know can i have this conversation publicly and can people benefit from it and so that's how we got started and i love gaming and stuff but i don't get to stream that quite as much hopefully that'll change in the next couple of months but we will see so who wants to who can tell us or maybe tell um and miss ashrox what do you go by um miss ash ash okay those are perfect um so who how can we help mizash try to but how can we help orient her to like what what are we doing here like what is this we're developing tools to overcome our hurdles as content creators like emotionally and dealing with the stress of it all i guess cool anyone want to add on to that or share a different perspective when i think of words i'm not having a good word today um [Laughter] we're supporting each other and helping each other to be able to find our similarities and differences so that in sharing we can you know find things that help ourselves um and yeah that's that's kind of the gist cool yeah and there's a variety of different topics that we're discussing in pursuit of that i guess goal to kind of um you know better but to to kind of i guess like relate to one another have discussions about like uh the realm of content creation and you know there are different things that we all go through each of our communities are unique we all come from different backgrounds things like that but in that we can also um find things that are really meaningful to each of us through a lot of the conversations that we do have here i think i'm caught up to speed i got this awesome you got this so what about some of the particulars like who's responsible for change in the group all of us yeah all of us right i don't know what was what was ash about to say hold ourselves accountable i mean at the end of the day we have to use those steps and whatever we learn and apply it to our day-to-day to prioritize our mental health more in this space cool and and how does this like work like what do we do on a week to week basis like what's the structure it looks like we have yep so it does look like we have homework and i mean do we just like kind of show up here and talk about our feelings for an hour and a half and then we're kind of is that what this is no what is it then if we were to sit here and just talk about our feelings we're not gonna move forwards it's just kind of like a venting which part of it can be that but it's understanding when that venting needs to take a turn and also equally share the the sharing and the conversation so that it leads in a direction to i don't want to find answers say answers but these in a direction to find solutions to help us understand ourselves better and each other better um to become better content creators and people anyone want to add on to that or have something that they want to share okay is al did you have something uh no actually i'm leaving i'm just kind of i'm just kind of nodding like you know i think people have covered it i mean yeah like uh we have homework we have some uh structured like topics to kind of unify around and share our different perspectives on and the hope is i think through that shared experience we come away with uh actionable um things that we can take to then change about ourselves or you know help ourselves and uh and yeah and we're accountable for that so great so what i'd love to do is just take a couple of minutes to try to kind of formally summarize i think you all have said all the important stuff but um part of what i think my role is is that there is a lot of like let's say science or experience or certain medical concepts psychological concepts which may apply to our discussions so for example there's research on imposter syndrome there are particular things that people with imposter syndrome do and so part of what i'm going to be trying to do a little bit is to share some of that information with y'all and then we're going to kind of try to work with it so the first thing that i'm going to kind of start off with because i love what ruby mentioned about venting so is to just kind of outline a model for a change so like this is going to sound kind of weird but like why is life hard because we make it hard how do we make it hard we over complicate everything how how does that work why do we do that what's the difference between me over complicating something and me simplifying something therefore it becomes easy like why don't we just make everything simplifying why don't we simplify everything and make everything easy for ourselves because we want better ourselves honestly and and i think we expect things to go in our way every time like every situation we expect it to go our way and when it doesn't then we break down and then we don't know how to kind of compile those feelings okay in my opinion okay i know that happens personally i mean not no it's not awesome i i i have this problem where when someone says something insightful i applaud it but oftentimes what they say is like negative so it's not awesome that things fall apart for you but it's awesome that you're articulating that and understanding that so i apologize for that you're fine i was gonna say oh sorry so no you got it you got it um i was gonna say i think we often over complicate things because we feel like we should know what we're doing and we should have everything figured out and by putting expectations upon ourselves we don't share our [Music] i don't want to call them weaknesses um but like the internet is very good at only showing like the highlight reel and it's easy to compare ourselves to someone else's highlight reel and as a content creator it's very easy to see numbers see success i put it in inverted finger commas because someone can appear successful but be very unhappy or struggling and i think that's where as content creators specifically we over complicate things because we don't reach out or people believe they should be in a better place they'd live up to their name or and things like that so it can be a quick spiral yeah i think to kind of add to that a little bit is just like we go through life without any sort of comparison point you know we can only experience the things that we experience and therefore like it's hard to go through and understand success metrics that work for you that will work for everyone right so it's not like it's not like a math problem right like the key to success isn't this thing that you it has like unified rules around it and so yeah i think we we over complicate things because you know we are complicated people and uh you know no solution kind of applies to everything about us specifically uh really and so like i think that's what the over complication comes from is that we try to apply our unique circumstances to potentially simple problems and over complicate them that way i've got a question for zell or anyone else so he says that like you know we have no like we only live our life right like i don't so as he put it we have no points of comparison where do our expectations come from i think they come from like media consumption right that's uh i think that's part of it is like we consume media on the internet or whatever and we apply that stuff whether consciously or unconsciously to our own lives and then we create expectations around them also just through lived-in experiences through the people around us so like we take in things from our family as we grow up or our friends and those give us you know small comparison points as well um so honestly just life around you i guess okay so like i'm gonna kind of point out something that i heard and i'm curious what y'all think about that and we're going off on a tangent by the way so zell saying like life is hard because we only live our life but we have these like we have no like points of comparison right we can't live in someone else's shoes so we can't sort of figure out a universal formula for success but what we need and so that's why life is hard because we go like looking for things but we we have our own unique bundle of advantages and disadvantages and yet we create expectations based on things outside of us it's like how what happens when we do that like if i'm a unique person who has advantages and disadvantages i have a particular spawn point right when i rolled this life on this earth i got a particular gender a particular race a particular ethnicity a particular location a particular socioeconomic status a particular set of parents and then my expectations seem to come from people that are not in my specific spawn so what does that do for us like what what happens when i have expectations that come from media family etc i think we we we attempt to apply them to ourselves as if they were our spawn points as you put it and so but then the reality is sometimes it's it's just different right like it doesn't necessarily apply and that delta between your expectation of what you want that you're trying to compare yourself to and your actual self are too you know those things can be a big thing and those differences in expectation can cause a lot of like i don't know stress and mental damage okay so did y'all catch when ash was talking she said something about expectations did y'all catch what she said about expectations ash do you remember what you said anyone can i don't think i remember what i said yeah so that brings up another good point so part of what we're also going to be doing here is training specific skills i don't expect you all to remember what everyone says at every moment so ash had said something but over time we're going to like literally become better listens listeners okay so ash said that she has expectations for herself this is sort of in relation to like the venting conversation or we kind of segued that way so she has expectations sometimes doesn't live up to those expectations there is some kind of consequence let's call it emotional damage and then kind of you feel bad about yourself because you didn't live up to things ruby also alluded to this when she talked about like oh i should do particular things right and when i hear a should i hear an expectation y'all with me there those two are the same things and then we're sort of left with like this pile of unhappiness and so this is really important to understand so if we wanna if we wanna think about why life is complicated it's because we don't i'm gonna sort of offer something okay this is a hypothesis so i would say that oftentimes if you think about situations in your life where like you were struggling i would argue that you really didn't understand the situation so simple example of this is like if anyone's been through a breakup and you kind of think that the world is ending when you're going through a breakup and you'll be alone forever and and all this kind of stuff right and then you don't know how to like take a step back but a couple months later you take a step back you kind of realize oh actually the breakup was probably good for me in the long run we just weren't meant to be together but there's kind of a lack of understanding there may have been particular expectations around that relationship which leads to a certain amount of suffering so this is kind of how we run through life that where we sort of don't understand stuff now the other challenge that zell kind of pointed out is that we are individuals with unique spawn points but there are there is stuff like science out there right so we do know that like we're not all the while there may not be a particular tutorial or walk through for your specific life there are general mechanics around you know what how life works so we know that there's some science around resilience some science around emotional wellness some science around performance and so the tricky thing though is that like this translation that zell alluded to that there's like there may be some amount of scientific truth out there but when it comes to applying it to our individual situation like that's where things get tricky so this is a precisely why we have the model that we use here at hg which is like there's some amount of concrete information but applying it to an individual requires like individual exploration and so what we're trying to do here is applied learning so as opposed to reading a book which is a one-size-fits-all solution or just going on a personal journey whether that's a personal journey that's like spiritual and i'm hiking in the himalayas or i'm seeing a therapist or i'm just like you know journaling for a long time what we have is a unique opportunity where we can work with each other so people can like piece together their experiences right so i get the sense that all of y'all have probably struggled with expectation but we can sort of like talk to each other and the other really interesting thing is that i don't know if this kind of makes sense but is it easier to see the problems in your thinking or easier to see the problems in someone else's thinking someone else's absolutely i am anyways oh yeah right and so the cool thing is that ash may be talking about all these expectations that she has which are like completely like based on inappropriate things that media has put in her head and the four of y'all are going to be able to see that as clearly as day ash isn't going to be able to see it the cool thing though is that once you see it in her it's going to be easier to see within yourself so the problem with solo exploration is that your mind is biased so what we're going to try to do is inquire with each other we're going to try to bring stuff out of each other but in doing so we're going to understand like the rules of the game make sense that's kind of what we're doing here last point that i want to mention about venting so why we don't this isn't about venting but venting has a very important point which is that when we're emotionally activated it's harder to see things clearly so we are going to vent some but the purpose of venting is very specific it's not venting to nowhere it's venting to decompress some amount of emotion so that we can see things clearly so that we can understand so that we can simplify and ultimately make our life easier does that make sense okay i'm gonna try to summarize with a formula and we can to support this formula we can offer citations from science or ancient spiritual traditions or clinical work y'all tell me if you want more detail on any of those realms but here's basically why life is hard the first thing is we don't understand what we're doing avidya or ignorance is the root of suffering and like once you understand stuff i don't know if you all kind of get this but like once you understand something things become just easier right once i understood that oh like you know whether it's a video game we're playing once you understand the rules it's like now it all makes sense so understanding is going to be our our key goal what gets in the way of understanding is a compromised mind so when our mind is not functioning clearly due to emotions or other kinds of things it's hard to see things so another role that we're going to have is to try to purify our mind so that we can look at things clearly and once we can look at things clearly we can understand things the other problem that we run into is that how does our mind become impure so we've already figured that out because when we set an expectation for ourselves that's unreasonable and then we fail to live up to that expectation what does that do to my mind it causes emotions and things to get in the way of you seeing clearly exactly right so expectation not living up to expectation results in emotional damage emotional damage impacts clarity of mind impact on clarity of mind leads to a lack of understanding of like what we're doing okay so then later maybe now maybe later we'll see we're gonna dig into like where do expectations come from and how can we on an individual level start to understand okay like what are like how why do i expect this for myself and we'll discover a lot of other interesting things like there's a hypothesis that having an expectation is the source of suffering as well make sense questions about any of this because that's what we're going to try to do okay so we we do have homework so i'm going to kind of pivot to that for a second and then i'll offer a couple of options about how we want to spend our the next hour okay so we had homework which was assigned um ash if you didn't do it no big deal or if no one did it that's totally fine too not a big deal but generally speaking uh the homework that the time that you'll put in between sessions will just help us advance things quicker okay so our homework for the week was to think a little bit about uh do you all remember what it was um yeah it was what do you want and what is holding you back great so why don't we kind of go around for show of hands who had a chance to do the homework okay so let's just start with the three all then no big deal if you didn't get a chance to do it so why don't you all share with us in like two to five minutes like a summary of what do you want and what's holding you back and for smirky and ash what i want you all to do is pay attention to what they say and i want you all to think about okay if our goal today is to like understand what we want and what's holding us back what are some common themes we can explore at the end of this like y'all are going to give us the direction or give us options for the direction okay take it away i'll go first so um when i think about what's holding me back um i kind of have this fear of the blank page uh whether it was like you know in fine art or writing or anything creative the moment i start it's like what's the point if the outcome is not going to be the result i wanted and being result oriented basically just stops you before you really get there um and i mean part of that expectation problem in and of itself is uh i was one of those gifted kids who was told that they were gonna go change the world and stuff and uh yeah that did not happen so um i mean the gifted programs are really really good for setting up really bad depression cases decades after uh i'm sure tons of people could associate with that if all they told you was you're super smart and you can do anything that's not true i mean you could be smart but you can't do everything like it's just not happening um so the moment that i hit something that i can't do immediately it's overwhelming and so just like initial difficulty breaking it down i immediately say to myself well you're supposed to be smarter than us and that ain't true uh i guess um there's also uh one thing that my one of my best friends told me is i struggle with my follow-through um like so committing to making like tick tocks every week or you know making sure that i'm on time every stream or or um eating right things like that it it being in the schedule and and making sure that it gets done like i want those things but there's always something in the back of my mind that says oh it's okay you know you you suck at this anyway um and i don't necessarily forgive myself but i just tell myself well you you were gonna fail so i guess that's what kind of holds me back is i already knew that i was to mess up from the start so yeah how is it what is it like to hear metric say that hard saddening like i feel sadness for you to to feel those things about yourself is i can relate uh with following through it's oh there goes something yeah i can relate with that um i'm supposed to post stick talk today oh it's fine i'll just do it tomorrow i don't feel good enough to do it and you just feel like a failure all the time um but we're not failures we're here to make impact we're communities and it's just always that voice in the back your head saying nope you're not good enough to do this today and you try again the next day well not good enough to do it next day still not good enough to do it so i can relate on that level absolutely and it sucks we have communities sorry we have communities that love us and appreciate our work and it's still just that voice taught us no we're not yeah like they're so supportive and then like if you like are totally honest about this stuff because like reaching back to like authenticity you know and being our authentic selves like i want to be honest about how i feel it's like when i when i say like you know i really want to stream this game but i have no idea if anyone's going to watch and then you know a bunch of people say oh we will totally but like i don't want to hold them to that that's like it's not you know so that nobody is owed like no no nobody owes me their time um even if you say you're gonna be there like god knows it's like it's not your job to be in my stream right like um and so managing what content i do how i change things up like the other day i i did a darkest dungeon stream which you know i hadn't done in ages and then somebody came in and literally just said i'm here for darkest dungeon and that's like my main game it kind of made me feel like well damn like i'm not saying you got to be here for me or the community or anything else but it's like i didn't want to know that and then since you're so we're we both are result oriented and then we don't see those results it just makes us backpedal even more when we should keep pushing and be proud of our work because i think yeah something else i have to learn not to be so heavy on the results and engagement from stuff i should just be proud of my content because the more you're proud of your content proud of the stuff you're doing that will attract more people you have to be proud of yourself in order to succeed you no i relate totally okay so i'm gonna i guess one oh so one thing i forgot to include i'm sorry was like i feel like there's like three kinds of people in this world which i know is very reductive but there's the people who like are willing to put themselves out there which i think we're all kind of a part of you know whether or not we're like introverted irl or not but a part of us wants to put ourselves out there there's people who like more or less consume and judge and i'm not saying it's necessarily a bad thing but you know they're relatively quieter um and maybe they don't want to be like you know public creators or whatever and that's fine but there is a definitely a smaller group of people on the other end who they only publicly put anything out when they need to tear something down and that's like for folks like us that's like the one thing that we have to work around and you know a lot of people say well if you're not willing to take like trolls or whatever then you can't be doing this but there is like a certain limit to how much you can take so sometimes when i'm thinking about trying something new i think about like those people more than say a normal consumer of content because i'm more worried about them okay so yeah anyway so i'm gonna actually give you all a choice so i know that we just have done one person's homework review but i'm tempted to kind of go off on this tangent of expectations that we should put on ourselves this idea of being a failure this idea of being results oriented but i'll kind of leave it up to the group do you all want to dig into that or do we want to continue talking about homework um i'm kind of on homework but okay others like what do others want to do great so let's continue with homework then did i do mine as i was the one that said are we just doing the what's holding us back a bit right now whatever whatever you want to share from the homework okay so i actually found the homework very inspiring um and i spent every day of the whole last two weeks working on it not in a physical way but um [Music] in a mental way i spent every day re-looking at the questions and spent part of my daily practice or whatever you want to call it focusing in on um [Music] mostly what's holding me back and then that led to what i want um [Music] so yeah i wrote i've been thinking about it for two weeks what was holding me back is now the question i know i've not completely worked through it and like you can't just like magic away things but um [Music] it's very similar to metric and ash and what was holding me back was fear and self-judgment and finding excuses allowing others to affect my emotions um [Music] i've recently just solved my house and i've moved back in with my parents for a short intermission before i move to another country so i'm in a different space um which throughout my yoga meditation practice because not having private space um [Music] i found quite quite hard to to get back into that practice um so i got myself back into my some meditation practice um some asana and some pranayama and taking pride in the knowledge that i have and the things i worked on prior to this point and knowing that i can [Music] because what was holding me back was not being confident in my own knowledge that i actually have a bit like how dr k is saying how does that feel to hear someone else say those things about themselves and if it hurts and it's sad like it makes me sad to hear someone um effectively like self-sabotaging in in ways and i have this practice of saying the things i'm feeling out loud to myself and then imagining if someone else was saying that to you and i wouldn't let them if all the things you're saying to yourself you wouldn't let someone else say to you then why are you letting them say themselves say them to yourself and this is something that i preach and i realize that i i can never be i i'm a human being i can never be perfect um and this is a mindset that i've spent my whole life kind of going and then like pulling myself back out up again and then going in and and i can be in that mindset whilst i'm on the hamster wheel and getting nowhere but i feel like i'm trying to find or starting to hit that place of is it eustress um and i forced myself to make a instagram reel that i'd wanted to make for about two years and it performed better than any of my other instagram reels because it was authentic and i'm doing that thing and where i nearly cry about like something um because it was authentic and it came from a place of um passion i guess like people could tell from the real i hope that it means a lot to me and yeah it was scary to press post but posting it almost felt like ripping off a band-aid and opening up a new book of content creation for myself so yeah that's the two weeks um when i did my coaching with one of your coaches dr k they would leave me homework and then they'd be like okay you've gone on to the next homework and then you've gone on to the next homework because once i something clicks like i have to keep going on it but that's how i can easily get on the hamster wheel again as well i'm very aware that like i can i can take that feeling and then i actually wrote down like maybe it's dopamine chasing as someone with adhd and then i lose the direction so i'm i'm trying to think about this differently and focus on it differently so yeah that was that was my homework awesome how did people uh how do y'all feel listening to that i wish i could have done that so what is that feeling metric uh not envy's not appropriate i'm happy for her because like envy implies like like i don't know it feels like it takes away from the person who achieves something um so if it's if it's inappropriate to have the feeling use the word inappropriate right right if it's inappropriate to have the feeling that means you're not feeling that correct no it's not that it's more like i mean i want that too but how do i i don't know if there's a word for you know a positive feeling of wanting the same if there's a word for that so sometimes when we see someone else doing something and we are happy for them and we want it for ourselves sometimes the word that we use is inspired is that what you're feeling though metric are you feeling inspired yeah let's see yeah okay any other feelings i mean it's easy to go back on myself and be frustrated and think like well you know why can't i think like that why i mean it's like what's holding me back it's like oh no i did the thing again so um i don't know uh yeah all good stuff we'll we'll get we'll figure it out metric any other any anyone else want to share their reactions to ruby's sharing i'm proud of you you know you say you have anxiety and you're up here speaking in you know in front of hundreds of people about your experience and how you're working through it so it is inspiring and i think you're very strong for that so that's my reaction and i want to be like you when i grow up but it is hard you know allowing i mean we're content creators it's hard not getting feedback or you know seeing troll messages and not getting engulfed with them and allowing that to stop your content creating so i'm proud you posted that reel there's plenty of content pieces i've been thinking about for the last six years and i'm terrified of it um but i think i have a unique experience with being a black woman because i feel like the industry is constantly against me i try not to let it get the best of me but it's hard especially when well this is why i stopped ex expecting things because you know you see your peers that don't look like you get a certain amount of engagement or numbers or something and you know you won't get that back but you just keep trying so that's my constant struggle i think in particular that's what's holding me back so that's my quick homework actually okay straight up the first time i ever heard of you was the trolling that you received when you were doing gtarp which was like all racially motivated and everything and i was just like oh absolutely like so yeah it's like i'm doing ten thousand other wonderful things but that's being highlighted of course i post like awareness but yeah and and i mean it's like yeah the i would rather found out about you through you know something positive that happened to you or something that you did rather than like you know something that just sparked outrage across twitter so but that's how this works too i guess so yeah in a constant battle of do i share this to spread awareness i mean people know these things happen to us but i feel like i have to continue to talk about it because people still don't believe like oh how are you getting racially targeted in games like what do you mean don't you live in this world it happens to us no i'm always in a constant battle of do i post do i post this should i share this and then i'm i have the mindset now of just not feeding into the hate and sharing it just sharing my wins the positive things and keeping up with that but does someone fill us in in terms of what what we're referring to like what happened oh what happened okay yeah totally i was playing gta rp in a new server this is my first time doing rp i was really excited um i'm not sure how i was targeted i think the server wasn't really protected so anyone could join it so i was playing as the ems and i was picking up a body on a street and i got ran over by a truck and of course there's invoice in-game comms so they were just screaming hard er hard er over and over and over and screaming my twitch name and then it happened a second time on a different day after alerting the server admins hey something's going on here there's somebody targeting me on my stream they see it happening happened twice so after that it did blow up because i post the clips on twitter and then i joined no pixel so something good came out of it but it just sucks that i had to be seen in that light you know and being vulnerable so yeah that was my first time being targeted it actually happened again a few weeks ago when i was playing the forest and they have these illegal mods to install into forest i guess this old game and the same thing happened a bunch of horrible things that i don't even want to repeat but yeah i don't know if it's through twitch or through what where i'm being targeted but yeah those are just the only two instances that happen in six years so i'm happy about that but still traumatized by it it's terrifying on online games but i just keep pushing i hear things every single day it's ridiculous thank you for sharing so i have my own struggles on top of being a marginalized creator so yeah how is that fair i don't want a struggle i don't want to say struggle i don't want to say struggle it's just something that happens but that's why i try to just keep good people around me stay positive of course i'm going to have bad days and that's normal to have bad days and i want to share when i have bad days and be transparent with my community hard it's just hard if it helps you if you want to laugh one time one of my mods told me that he doesn't see color and i was like don't give me that crap and he's like no no i'm actually color blend and i was like oh see that's funny so there you go zell you want to share uh your homework uh sure um so yeah like uh things i want i guess starting off with that um i think for me it's a lot of just i want to make stuff that i'm proud of i think a lot of the work i've done um thus far has been good but like i specifically i also want things that like are my responsibility of things like i've been part of a lot of other big projects around me i'm like one of the people in it so like you know i was one of the founding members of offline tv i was uh you know a talk show host on a show owned by riot uh you know i was a guest on this other show that uh you know is now big and so like a lot of my success i feel like has come uh from kind of being in the right place at other people's point of journeys and so for me a lot of what i want now is like i want to prove that i can do it myself and that i have stuff that i can show the world that uh that i'm proud of um i want to have fun uh you know like i i want to enjoy the things that i'm doing i want to uh not worry about finances and uh you know as a content creator um and i think like part of what's tough about being a content creator sometimes is like you want to be not results oriented but at the end of the day you know we live in a society where you know money is at the end of the day important and like you can't you can't ignore that um and that's part of like the probably for me anyways like that's part of the the ticking cycle of like what creates these expectations um in terms of uh what i want to focus uh or like what i want to work on what i struggle with or what i you know have a challenge with um for me it's uh like kind of like what people are saying like kind of commitment but like for me i think one of the hardest things was is now that i'm kind of on my own and trying to prove to myself that i want to make my own content and stuff like this that uh it's hard to choose a path um i think i relate with metric a little bit you know like i was a gifted kid you know um and the thing is that i have like the track record to show that i can i actually kind of feel a little differently in some ways because like i really genuinely believe in myself that i can do whatever i want to do but it's actually because of that that i uh have a hard time choosing you know like i i know i was good at math and sciences and so i got my degree in mechanical engineering but then i liked making video content and so my first job out of college wasn't that it was to make videos for an esports team and then like you know i and then i started playing competitive smash and then i you know like i just jumped around to think the thing and like um [Music] and what the end result is now is that like i'm really good at a lot of things but as a content creator i think it's important to have like your main thing that you're known for and so um personally speaking that's like a challenge for me uh another thing i struggle with is just like asking for help from people i think too um you know this is for specifically content creation it's made it hard to uh like do collabs because um i think like talking to other people about uh content uh is difficult for me um in general i think just that's just like a life thing for me is just like i've kind of always relied on myself and again part of that like belief that i can do anything is that i've shown to myself over time it's like a it's like a reinforced behavior for me that like i know that if i work hard enough at something like i will be able to do that thing um and so on that front it also makes it more difficult to like ask other people you know for either friendships or collabs or whatever um and then the last thing that was kind of on my well actually no this is part just another list uh part of the list but life balance as well was uh something that i struggle with where it kind of content creation always feels like this 100 or 00 deal where you're either maximizing everything that you possibly can or it's kind of not worth doing you know like for example if you made a youtube channel and you posted one video a month starting out it probably doesn't feel like enough compared to like someone on a weekly schedule or on a daily schedule and like especially because like content these days is oriented towards uh consistency at like a rapid pace you know like most of the big channels when you're competing against uh you know people with a lot more resources than you you know they have teams of editors who can pump out video after video after video and so like you know um and the truth is that that's just that's just playing the numbers game and like uh like i think there was a video that ludwig put out that i thought was really insightful about content creation which is just like every every youtube video every content piece that you put out is a lottery ticket and so the more lottery tickets that you put in the more likely that you're going to succeed somewhere along the way and one of your lottery tickets might win and so like it kind of feels like again it's kind of like well is it worth it to just pick up one lottery ticket a week or if i'm going to make lottery tickets i might as well get as many as i can to try to maximize my percentage right um so that's definitely like a thing that goes in my mind about life life balance and then the last thing is i wrote a couple of fears that uh that i have is just like um fear of not meeting my own expectations potential which is funny because we talked about it just now about how expectation is the source of suffering and um and i mean this has been a common theme i think with a lot of the things that people are saying is just like how our expectations continually bring our suffering um and the the trouble i have with that statement a little bit is like i feel like i'm conflicted because on one hand these expectations i feel like are necessary for me to feel like i'm working uh on something that i can be proud of because i feel like if i don't have any expectations i feel like i can't i i guess like there's that fear that i i lose my sense of like quality i guess and like part of like making good content is understanding what is good and therefore creating an expectation from it um and then my last fear that i wrote down was just complete misplaced judgment at my own potential so like i've talked i think a little bit now uh right now where like i feel like i could do anything and i have a proven track record but like what if that track record is completely like just luck you know and like uh what if i was just at the right place at the right time uh for all these things and what if like i'm not really as good at things as i think i am and in that case as a content creator am i even in the right space to to be here and like do is that is my belief in being a content creator completely misplaced so can i interject is that okay yeah just because i would say the right place right time thing like as far as content creation goes luck is a skill um it's it's it's one thing to want the opportunity it's another thing to be ready for when the opportunity strikes and so i think you're writing off the fact that you were ready for those opportunities when they presented themselves um that's that's what i would take away from that it wasn't that oh i was lucky to have these chances it was it was good of me to like you know strike while the iron was hot so i i wouldn't i wouldn't take that away from yourself what is your instinctive reaction to what metric said i think uh yeah i mean i think like there's a part of i'm conflicted because on like what is your instinctive reaction uh what came first we know you're conflicted and we know what the two sides are which one came first he wanted to punch me he wanted to punch me yep no i mean it was like i guess denial at first um okay yeah so now we're going to learn something really important so when this is exactly why we're doing this right so remember we talked about internal biases like we can't see stuff for ourself right so when when metric says what he says is that supportive or or unsupportive supportive is it validating or invalidating i think that's happening right what would that be up to you or sure what do you all think though i would say on the surface it's invalidating what cell's expressing but underneath it's a it's kind of if it it's like you say it's up to zero if it hits the right place and zell it could be validating but did it hit the right place since okay so we're gonna do a little experiment right zell bro this sounds terrifying man because here's what i'm here's what i'm hearing okay i'm hearing that like objectively you have a ton of successes behind you like you ran a podcast for freaking riot you're one of the founding member members of otv like that's amazing man at the same time you're you're never the lead right you're like second fiddle to someone else's thing and so what i'm hearing is like did you just get like did you because we're talking about lottery tickets did you just win the lottery a couple of times or is it like really you is it your work or did you just get lucky like i can totally even like or or is it even like his win i guess yeah how does it feel to hear me say that so uh i don't even know where to begin i mean like yeah i feel yeah i'm not sure i i'm actually i'm not actually not sure yeah um right so maybe we'll run a couple of predictions so what i'm imagining the reason that you have trouble answering it is because it's bringing up a lot of conflicting feelings so on the one hand i'm guessing that you feel heard and understood but you also feel terrified because maybe i get it and what if it's right and so like maybe we're on the same page but the page that we're on is not a good page it's a crappy page but we're there together how does that is that what you're feeling maybe like resonate with you not resonate with you yeah i think that resonates a bit you know cause like uh yeah it feels like yeah i mean there there might be some truth behind it and it might be a tough pill to swallow potentially but also at the same time yeah like you said it does feel like you're on the same page i guess okay yeah so now this is really important right so are y'all hearing i'm thinking about how to ask this so right now zell is conflicted when i say what i say like let's let's try this on precise actually it's gonna be facetious but zell you should believe in yourself you can accomplish anything that you put your mind to thanks man i believe in you you're amazing you've done so much awesome stuff in the past and like if you've been so successful how could you not be successful in the future believe in yourself you were gifted from day one remember so so this is where i mean that that wasn't really fair i'll i'll try to do a a metric did a far more authentic job so my point is this when we're struggling like there's something that kind of bothers me a little bit that's going on i don't know if we're really ready for that but there's like too much false positivity here do we want positivity absolutely but there's like a little bit too much false positivity the interesting thing is that the false positivity is not coming from interactions between people so what metrics said to zelle i think is very authentic and very positive the false positivity is when we're talking about ourselves and i don't know that we're ready for that yet but like actually i don't know how to say this but when y'all tell yourselves i can do it what does that do to you and then it sets up the initial expectation so right like so like and if you can do it and you don't do it what does that say about you that you that i failed yeah right yeah because i don't know there was a comment that metric made earlier that stuck with me um about like paying attention to you i'm sorry um oh yeah no sorry uh no it's okay there was a comment that stuck with me earlier about how like um because metrics was like oh yeah i did the whole like gifted thing and then uh you basically were like thinking about um you know you you were like it was kind of like yeah i can't do this but then you were kind of like um ah it was you were kind of like oh but that that's not really like you know worth it like you know it's it's not sorry words um because because you because you because you commit to what it is you commit to but in the back of your head you kind of run with this notion like oh you know what's the point if x y or z like you kind of have this this thing running in the back of your head um and i forget the exact quote the exact verbiage but there was something in there that stuck with me and i guess that's kind of i don't know i'm only bringing it up because it it feels like you kind of circled back around to it how it's like oh like you know you've committed to this thing but do you truly in the back of your head believe it even though you have committed to this thing and you're like yeah i can do this but is that really what you believe that you can do or are you just saying it just because i guess that's what i'm trying to say right so here's what's happening when we commit to something where does that commitment come from yeah does it like just come from oh i've done it a million times and i've you know is it like part of the i guess machine or is it like a true authentic genuine like yeah i'm like ready to go i'm ready to commit to this thing yeah so the i was going to say is it the should that i was talking about like last time that should feeling didn't exist when i made that real for instagram that did really well the should feeling wasn't there the i'm doing this because it feels good was there and i want to and i've been holding myself it's a com making that content felt separate from any other content i've ever made it's not even a minute it took me like four takes two of them i forgot to turn the microphone on because i was really nervous and then i laughed at myself and then the last one was perfect and i just put it up online but ruby and did you try to make it perfect no why not i just spoke is it because you're trying to make it perfect the way that you get the best views no not always no no no because if you're too perfect people can um [Music] almost write you off they can they can see they can't see like they can see through it that it's curated and it needed to be in that moment i needed to record it then and put it up if i didn't record it then and put it up when i was in that moment and i felt the calling to do it basically you could argue that that in itself is your perfect video right like because perfect doesn't if you yeah i didn't care if it was perfect or not i just needed to make sure it had the message that i wanted to say in it and people would understand that and i listened to it once and was like okay it works it gets the message across it doesn't need to be fancy it doesn't need to i didn't see anyone else or look like i have this habit before of um okay i want to make a video like like this but i'm gonna look up if anyone else has done it oh that's terrible see what other people are doing or and like call it research but it's not really research it's just like a little self-sabotage because you you knew what you wanted to do but yeah it was just a little talking yourself out of it you're doing that self-destruct thing again aren't you like yeah so let me ask you all a question we're gonna go back to zell for a second this is all really fantastic so if if we spend the next couple of weeks telling zell that we believe in him we believe in yousel you can do it see here all the ways why your lack of faith in yourself is undeserved because you have all these successes and we're going to support you because that's what we do is the goal of this group support we asked this question at the very beginning i think we'd have to ask ourselves is it the end goal or is it part of a bigger goal so what is what is our goal for zell what do you all think what do you all want to see him do we want him to be self-sufficient okay so that when we're not around he can do the things that he wants to do okay or at least try to do them okay i want you all to pay very close attention what were the what does so sure we're going to help him to be self-sufficient but self-sufficient to do what what did y'all what were the verbs that metric used believing like nope not believing like just now like yeah just now like you used the right words but what were they he said he he said to try that's one thing try trying to be selfish right he wants zell this is the tricky thing when we start speaking from in here before we really understand we don't even know what we're saying but our brain picks the right word even if we don't realize it he wants his goal for zelda for zelda to do what he wants to do and his goal is for zell to try when is y'all's goal to try is that actually what your goal is never your goal is to succeed it's not to try except yeah i'm we're getting to you i was gonna say i i try every day a little bit right so and so and what we hear from ruby is that when she actually stops trying to succeed and just put something out there that's authentic like that's actually when things go well and what we heard from ash is that she sets like expectations for herself right this it all comes back to like no one is focused on the trying everyone's focused on living up to the expectations and the the bizarre thing is if if i start here and i expect this of myself and i end up moving this far am i a success or a failure in your mind you're a failure have i progressed or am i saying this is staying in the same spot you have but you might not fully recognize that you've progressed like i want you all to really think about this let's say that my goal is to gain 10 pounds and that's my goal and i gain 5 pounds and i view myself as a failure what does that end up doing towards my motivation i've gained five pounds halfway to my goal no motivation kind of takes the motivation honestly if you don't hit your goal sorry i think it's different when well you can't control your weight but you have more control of that but when it's something with consecration you don't really have control so i feel like those are different those are absolutely different we'll dig into those nuances i'm trying to use this to illustrate a principle about expectation and there's there's a big difference huh me trying to run away from it no no so no so ash we want you to run away from it right because the goal here is not for the goal here is for if you if you're not buying what i'm selling that's a problem that we all need to fix together and i'm not the arbiter of truth like you know i don't understand the youtube algorithm at some divine level and the whole point is that my answers may not apply to you because i don't know if you all could tell but i'm pretty sure ash and i have lived remarkably different lives just in terms of like when we walk into a grocery store or when there's a police car behind us how we get treated right so like if ash is running in the opposite direction you run you go as far as you want to we're going to chase you and we're going to figure it out together what i'm hearing though from today and this is to kind of like i know smirky i know i've asked you for themes and stuff but we've got 10 minutes left and i think you did a really good job of tying things back so that was awesome but i think that like we're hearing i think what we're talking about today is expectation and what i'm hearing from zell is that he like he expects a lot from himself and he's not sure that he can live up to it and this is where we got to be really really careful because if we're supportive what we're doing is zell expects this this is where he thinks he is and we say absolutely zell we believe you we believe in you you can get up here and we're going to support him to move towards his goals and what we're actually going to do is reinforce his expectation what we're actually going to do is say yes you should be able to do it and it's just you're dumb ass that lacks confidence in yourself that you don't believe in yourself so let me give you a here's oh here comes the airplane with a spoon full of confidence open wide cell because you've accomplished so much now there's cognitive bias there too because i think metric is on to something right and we'll discover that what metrics stumbled on is actually really really important there is evidence that shows that people who have especially imposter syndrome attribute their successes to luck but they attribute the successes of others to failure i mean to to effort so if someone else succeeds they did a good job but when i succeed i got lucky so the way that we cognitively deal with that is a little bit different the other question that we all we're gonna ask we're not gonna ask metric but we're gonna answer it for him is does metric talk to that the way that he saw what zell's real strength is right because i think that's authentic i think he's correct i'm not saying he's wrong does he see that within himself no i totally get that because i think of all the emails i never answered that would have potentially given me more opportunities but i was like i'm not good enough for this and i just left it alone and i totally self-sabotaged myself so i know that i did not take advantage of those things when they came along this is what's cool that we'll get to that in a second so can we acknowledge that metric is going to feel what kind of emotion as he talks about the scenario of not responding to emails how how does he feel what do you all think is important potentially regret disappointment regret guilt right and and like this is where things get tricky because like if we want to be validating so like get ready for it okay metric i think you kind of screwed up there bro hell yeah [Laughter] now let me ask you do you think that just because you screwed up in the past do you think you're going to continue to screw up i would like that to not be a pattern of behavior so yeah and so i know that's something i want to develop out of so yeah and and so like do you think we can help you with that i would i would very much like that please how are you feeling right now metric um well i mean silly but also like you know it's it's i think in a way we wouldn't be here if we weren't hypocritical on ourselves right so um yeah definitely definitely the the do as i say not as i do kind of thing um yeah man that's hard like that because you're right like we're all like that right so i think me and everyone in this group would like to help you change how do you feel about that i would i would love to take advantage of everything that comes my way so so you know now i'm going to ask you all a question if i didn't say you kind of screwed up there what what is me saying that do for metric like what was our sequence of events who can kind of map it out it opened metric up to talk more about the situation like metric came back with like a jokey response but it was like yes i did kind of mess up that and i want to make a change so it's kind of like i won't say kinda it was it was totally it's it's a turning mental kind of turning point it's uh i love that phrase mental turning point but here's the thing unless we like go to where he is and meet him where he's at we can't move him forward and we can't get him to turn if we tell metric no like oh like bad things happen to all people like you shouldn't beat yourself up so much like but he does beat himself up right and we say like you know what you're down in the trenches you kind of screwed up and like we're gonna help you with that we're gonna acknowledge that you made a mistake and so the the the what i want to be careful about here i know this sounds kind of weird but like when someone kind of screws up and they beat themselves up and they call themselves so like what sometimes happens we get stuck between not we feel like a failure but we try to convince ourselves that we're not and i know this sounds kind of bizarre but i think actually the right move is to not try to convince people that they're not failures the right move is to actually say if you feel like a failure you know some of that is a little bit unfair but if you kind of screwed up that's okay and also like i don't want the mistakes of the past i don't want you to be afraid of failure but any time we try to convince ourselves that we're not failures what we're actually doing is like reinforcing the fear of failure does that make sense yes it makes a lot of sense and i i resonate with it so tell me what what do you resonate with smirky go um the whole the whole beating yourself up thing like i when i think about it it does help reinforce that fear of like well i don't want to be back in this position again where i'm internally beating myself up for xyz right so and that's something i always like struggle with going through like school like you know going through college trying to maintain high standards and maintain good grades and things like that so i don't know um it's something i can resonate with a lot good right because that's what i it's really subtle because and it's not it's not really our fault because we're never really taught how to deal with failure what we're taught is that you shouldn't fail right so like what we're doing is like like you know it's like we're running like dodge builds i don't know if this makes sense to people y'all like how much gaming y'all do but it's like the whole point is to like no hit build well it's like a no hit run like perfection what's actually like sure once in a while someone pulls that off but what's like a lot better is to like go with a healer right and like you just acknowledge that sometimes stuff ain't gonna work if we go back to this you know people someone mentioned ludwig and lug was like you know you're just buying lottery tickets that's only a strategy if you can afford for lottery tickets to be failures over and over and over and over again but if you're unwilling to let that lottery ticket be worthless then like every time that lottery ticket doesn't win you fall short of your expectation all of this negative emotion comes up you go into this cycle of like counteractive positivity because that's what we learn right we learn like oh i can't beat myself up you don't want to swim in the negativity so you try to counter it with positivity instead of actually like detoxifying that negative emotion and the way that you detoxify it is you actually like acknowledge it so when people see i feel like i live in like the space between you know learning from a mistake and turning it into a positive or just wallowing in the failure of like not acting on it so it's like it could have been a good thing but now i've just turned it into a really bad thing and i'm just eating that so yeah we gotta be super careful with you metric because that is the kind of thing that somewhere along the way your mind is like splitting towards the negative right like you acknowledge that both of those things are there but you're moving down one path and then that gets reinforced somehow so we're gonna have to figure out how to do that but we'll help you with that cool so i think that so what what are like some takeaways for today like what are people like getting from this i know i know we touched on a lot of different stuff i feel like some dots are connected but there's not really a picture like what are people taking away from this um self toxic positivity we need to actually acknowledge our emotions and our reactions to our feelings um and sit with them personally this is something that i was working on myself because i realized that just by asking myself that question for two weeks made me realize i'm reacting rather than acknowledging and then digging a little bit deeper why do i feel like this what is this actually a reaction to what do i want from this reaction [Music] why do i feel like this like basically sometimes we feel a certain way and we all get all jumbled in our feelings so we're missing that clarity that we were talking about at the beginning um and just hopefully learning to get more of that clarity um maybe that like expectations rob us of the gratitude of success well so far it's like okay that set up right now yeah right anyone else yeah like oh yeah like i i i didn't do my homework because i was at pax west but basically i i feel like i'm still getting a lot out of this um kind of like just diving into it um uh and i i i do like what ruby said about like instead of just like being reactive but actually sitting down and acknowledging your emotions that's something that i've like it's one of those things where i like know that it's important personally to like sit down and acknowledge how you feel and not just full you know it's it's good to like fully be present with your emotions but i don't know for some reason it it's it's a whole nother thing to actually like put that acknowledgement into action um so i don't know that's just something i guess i kind of noticed and one to like take away out of the session to like maybe get some kind of action plan going for it sure we'll talk about that smirking sure sure yeah i noticed that i'm missing the clarity piece eventually when things don't go my way or you know expectations i just get upset with myself and shut down and i need to learn how to get out of that rut and just keep moving forward and staying in a positive mindset instead of just going in a downward spiral because that's my weakness at the moment okay something's wrong i'm just it's a bad day like it's an automatic bad day but i know towards the end of my day i try to just de-stress and think about the positives of my day so i just need to do more of that okay and just better understanding how i feel let's stop setting expectations yeah so but be careful because hold on a second so did y'all notice so we got to be careful what did you all notice about what ash just said did y'all notice anything i noticed a little bit of toxic positivity slide in there yeah you set some expectations of yourself whilst telling yourself not to set expectations and that you just had to focus on the positive try to be better and not always think of the negatives that happen throughout the day right so so it's well said i i think i think ash is moving in the right direction but i'm glad you all picked up on that subtlety right so we're gonna help her massage that a little bit because i think what ash has learned is like i don't know how to say this but it's like a a double-edged sword of a strategy in that in order to combat the tide of negativity you need something but it like it she like overcomes the feeling some kind of failure or whatever by setting an expectation to be more positive so it's kind of like we we're going to try to figure out if there's some other way for her to do it because there's i mean because we don't want to as metric kind of mention this too that we don't want to just like go down the downward spiral and that's what's so hard about sitting with your emotions because if we're not careful we're just going to like hang out with them they're going to like occupy every corner of our mind and we will spiral down so it's not when we say like oh just sit with your negative like that's hard it's a skill that has to be learned but i'm glad that you all caught it we're gonna see we'll see how that morphs over time okay anyone else want to share um a takeaway or anything like that i'm noticing that everyone's sharing one thing we don't have to do that but i think it just sort of feels nice and complete i just am terrified that there's one person who's like hasn't really like is still sort of sorting through things and doesn't have something nice to say and then they feel like now i have to say something but you know and zel's the only one that hasn't spoken yet so zell if you want to say something you can't but if you don't that's okay too i mean yeah i mean just like uh i think today taking away just how expectations um like when we were all kind of sharing our homework stuff you know just how expectations sort of um damage uh ourselves and get in the way of um just getting in the way of things and i guess like moving forward i'd love to see like i've because i kind of mentioned this before but you know like what level of expectation is good or how do we manage our expectations in a way that we accept them when we don't live up to them um and then i think the other takeaway is like i mean this is just like my uh feeling from the group stuff is like i think a lot of times we kind of default to being positive as like a way to shield ourselves a little bit and like i think um like in these sessions i feel like yeah we kind of are still in a point where we're like hiding ourselves a little bit through by like being positive and stuff and uh i would love to see like in the future people you know really get down into like what bums them out and like you know like not trying to necessarily spin it into a positive necessarily to kind of like protect ourselves so um but yeah anyways yeah so zell what are you gonna do about that probably ask people to actually dig into you know what they what they actually mean you know how they actually feel about these things without like you know saying the word like yeah i just need to be positive you know like actually yeah so that that's like that's a responsibility if you see that happening you should address it right so i modeled how to do that a little bit today i'll continue teaching you all how to do that but if you kind of like at like you know and it's it's okay like we don't want to be like all negative right but i i i i would agree with you and by the way that's completely normal because it's like week three right we took a week off we're still getting to know each other it's being streamed on the internet so like it's gonna take some time for us to feel safe to kind of get down there um so one tip i'll give you all for that is when someone shares something negative because actually you'll do a good job of this you'll share your negatives what we tend to do though is offer support when someone shares a negative which is normal right like and at the same time say thanks for sharing and yeah sometimes just leave it at that but there's more potential there right and so that's the key thing is that if we really want to help someone understand what's going on when we offer support there's no follow-up conversation you'll notice that it's like we can say like we can express appreciation that's great i'm not saying don't do that but it's like you know if we say like oh like thank you for sharing silence i've been [Music] i was gonna say i've been trying to learn to not say i'm sorry to hear that to people because it's quite it's a it's not even in my language i learned it from america i actually had to learn it it's something i learned from having american friends i when people would say something i didn't know what to say and then i realized americans say this oh i'm so sorry to hear that i'm sorry that happened or but having had it done to me from someone who doesn't use that normally in their language it kind of feels invalidating or cuts off yeah the negative thing that you just said so the hard thing you know yeah so what we can do is i think it's fine to express i'm sorry or whatever like that's not a bad thing to say it's just we need to add something to that and what do y'all think we add to it any sort of follow-up question that might come to mind or i i don't know because sometimes i just like i sit there and i'm like okay but after di after attempting to digest all of that what is something i could pull apart from that sure and for me i think it just takes a bit longer to like get to that point absolutely right so it's a skill we're gonna work on it next week okay so just a kind of a quick summary and then we'll offer homework so first of all thank you all so much for all of your contributions because i think that we're learning like i love i i could not ask for a better group in terms of where y'all are because it's great because y'all are authentic y'all are struggling and y'all are really trying to figure this out and that's that's the best recipe honestly because if y'all had all the answers we wouldn't be here um and and so it's it's really good i really appreciate it i'm confident that we're gonna do a couple things and i apologize but i think i heard a little bit more from metric ash and zell but in my mind there are a couple things that i want to happen by the end of our time together i want metric to no long or not no longer fear the blank page you're going to be terrified of the blank page and i want you to start doing whatever you want to on the blank page even if you're afraid even if it's going to fail even if it ain't going to work i want you to not let the fear of the blank page control you for ash i hate to put this expectation or goal on you and i recognize i'm making a mistake here but what i honestly in my heart of hearts what i want you to do when ruby shared that she had made an instagram reel you said that there's something i wanted to do for six years nothing if there's one thing what i want to do this is not an expectation on you but what i'm gonna try to do have no idea because you've been trying for six years so what can we accomplish in six weeks probably not enough but what i'm going to try to do is help you do whatever that is i have no idea what it is i have no idea if it's possible but in my heart of hearts what i want to do is help you move forward in that way and for zell the concrete thing that we're going to get you to do is ask for help okay so like i don't know how we're gonna do that but it's gonna be all up yeah for ruby and smirky sorry i don't have something for you all yet i get the sense that ruby's like on her journey we'll see you know where something comes up and smirky was i'm aware it can fall apart at any time great so we're waiting for that to happen you know but you know it and this is where sometimes there's things in group have to be a little bit uneven from a week to week basis but over time we're kind of thinking about those things okay ruby gives me hope i just that makes me happy but i'm not trying to put pressure on her but i like that yeah so sorry you don't put pressure on me though because part of my realization recently is i am just a human being and so if things do fall apart i know i can learn from that and and like i know that sounds too positive or whatever it does right now does it sound too positive not really like i can have a bad day and i can but and i can have bad times but i don't feel pressure because i am just a person and by having a human moment that's not the best that can be inspirational to you as well great right so we want to be careful about toxic positivity but positivity is not toxic right so like i think those kinds of authentic positive shares are like good so last thing to consider um just to kind of recap so as we were talking about why is life hard because we don't understand what on earth we're doing makes sense right as we get more experience as we figure things out some things become easy some people never figure things out and so they continue to have problems so what makes it hard for us to figure things out we're we have a mind that's cognitively biased a lot of times those biases have to do with emotions that come up set an expectation for myself don't live up to that expectation negativity arises negativity clouds my judgment i can't figure things out i repeat the cycle so now the question is where does that expectation come from so we explored that a little bit but what i want you all to do is be more precise so i want you to pick somewhere between one and three expectations that you actually have for yourself and try to figure out as precisely as possible where did that expectation come from when was it born where did like where did you set this goal for yourself why if you say if you made a commitment to make one tick tock a day how on earth did you decide on one tick tock a day why not two tick tocks a day why not one tick tock every other day why not five tick tocks a week because what we'll discover because and i i sort of get the sense that zell was alluding to this but like if we have no expectations can we have direction because we get a lot of our expectation we get a lot of our direction from our expectations and goals right so expectations are normal like our brain will make them so that's okay but we need to be more sophisticated in the way that we create expectations for ourselves instead of having them automatically like media influence plus parents and like that's a terrible recipe for expectations so are we going to learn how to get away from them yes but we also want to be a little bit more calculating in terms of how we set goals okay questions before we wrap up uh random tangent comment i feel like that's gonna be such a good conversation for me because i know i was a little on the quieter side today but i think because like i run with the notion oh i don't need to like set expectations for myself that's negative or whatever so then a lot of the times i'm like oh i don't have a sense of direction on what i want to do next and i'm indecisive so completely random tangent comment but i think next week that's going to be really good to touch on okay sorry that's all awesome thank you for sharing so my last question for you all is um is anyone streaming right now so i will be in like 15 minutes okay but i know y'all rated me last time so i want to make i want to open it up to anyone else we got to send people somewhere but if you're going to be streaming in 15
