your mind especially when it's hopeless is not a very good predictor of the future does that make sense hello hi how are you um um right now um [Music] i'm happy to be here um but generally i've been feeling hopeless and lost oh my goodness can you start by telling me how what what uh how you what you go by or how i should refer to you um leah is fine leah yeah so i'm so sorry to hear that leah that you've been feeling hopeless and did you say directionless yes yeah can you tell me a little bit about that um well i was doing well for a bit um i just and then i don't know like even like monday i was like really doing well and hopeful and then just it was like every day something terrible happened and i'm back at a place of hopelessness and like i don't i can't see the future basically um that sounds awful yeah well can you help me understand a little bit when you were feeling hopeful on monday how long had you been hopeful because you oh my it was like building up and then well actually um i think it was building up and it was just like a full day or two just like you know things are gonna be really good actually and i was telling my friends like i think things are going to get better for all of us you know and then it definitely didn't like you know yeah can you tell me can i ask you a couple questions about that yeah um so what so it sounds it sounds like you had a string of bad stuff happen to you yeah can you share do you feel comfortable sharing like what happened um i can try okay um i had people close to me experience like huge loss okay and um and then my family as well i i experienced a huge loss in my family like back in january and i hadn't really gone back more than a few times and i went back this past week um and to look through the estate stuff oh my goodness yeah yeah and and then i had like you know my very close friends lose people and i won't tell their you know yeah of course but it was like a big deal but um yeah if i'm hearing yeah go ahead sorry oh i was just gonna keep going yeah keep going oh my god there's more um i experienced you know like a rejection you know so uh that was hard but it was like i was feeling really positive about it but then i think with all this other stuff i was like oh i don't know if i can handle this you know sure and in rejection in in sort of a a personal way or professional way or what um one specifically was like romantic okay in other ways i'm also job hunting you know so that's like the whole thing um but it was like a very close friend of mine that i have feelings for but um and i was like you know obviously usually i would be fine you know i think but i think with everything else yeah it just became kind of unbearable and it was like everything in my every section of my life felt tainted and just bad yeah i mean it sounds like you can't catch a break in like any dimension it sounds like your friends are going through a lot your family is going through a lot you're going through a lot and and it also sounds like there's like actual literal like death involved yeah and then of course the nail on the head was like you know what friday or whatever when the roe v wade stuff happened it was like wow i feel completely powerless like in anything you know because i am a woman in the us and that's it's just you know it's terrifying yeah when you said i'm a woman in the u.s my instinctive response was my condolences which is such an absurd thing to say so i just laughed a little bit there i i did sometimes i i laugh arguably inappropriately when people are different it's okay i've been like laughing this whole time like out of nervousness so like yeah so i mean lay it sounds like i mean can i just think for a second because that that's yeah so i you know my first thought is when people call in presumably i'm supposed to be able to help them in some way right like that's why people call in is that yeah we're here to help the first thing that i want to say is that i i don't i don't know exactly what we're gonna be able to do for you but i i oddly enough i'm not hopeless with you but i i can absolutely see how this is not something that um can be fixed with a bit of advice or some kind of like you know revelation like sometimes when people struggle in our community i think it's because they're doing something wrong right so either we'll get a particular thought that takes control of our mind or we'll have like a cognitive bias or you know we're playing spending too much time on the internet or things like that whereas in your situation i i genuinely feel like i mean this is you know a lot of this stuff is really has nothing to do with your choices and and i could totally understand how it feels hopeless because it's not like you're doing anything wrong does that make sense yeah how do you feel about that uh you know it's just that hopeless feeling um i do want to say like your work has helped me a lot um and i just appreciate that generally even if you feel like you don't have like revelation right now but like the past few months it's been very helpful can you help me understand that a little bit what's been helpful you did this interview i think with i can't find it i think it was with ms kif but it was like a meditation where like he you could feel your though you higher than you like pulling your thoughts back basically i don't know this is sorry if this is like completely irrelevant no but it was like a huge thing for me because it helped me realize like soul like there is a soul like i don't know it was a huge spiritual thing for me and it's part of like what keeps me going right now um leia i'd love to hear more about that are you comfortable talking about that for a little bit yeah if it's okay we talk about spiritual stuff i don't i i might not assume it is but yeah um i mean because i i think in a situation like this when we can't bring people back from the dead and we can't make people fall in love with you yeah um i i think i'd i'd love to hear a little bit about that practice and what you sort of experienced and and what you've learned from it yeah i mean i believe i don't fully know my beliefs are like what to label them or anything but i know like i believe in i think i believe in souls and like reincarnation and stuff like that so i find myself being like well if you do just quit now you're just gonna be going back into it like i don't know like i might as well try to make the most of this body in life and everything um i don't know okay yeah so i actually lay i really appreciate your perspective because i think sometimes we start with beliefs you know we say like this is what i believe but what i really hear from you is that you're figuring it out like kind of like one sort of painful step at a time which which is exactly how kind of i i've in a sense quote-unquote figured it out for myself it was like it's really confusing but i really found that meditation helped me have a couple of foundational experiences that then helped me like organize my life and if you're open to it i'd love to try to facilitate that process for you yeah so tell me a little bit about when you did that practice what did you experience i'm not sure how to describe it but it was like i just remember feeling like completely shocked like i don't know just come not shocked but like it was just mind-blowing like that experience it was like i just felt in touch with myself on such a level i don't know yeah so so let me ask though that that's great so so i i think i understand what you mean and i know it's kind of weird so like there's there's the you right so the you involves like a body and a mind and hopelessness happens within the body and the mind does that make sense yeah and what you experienced in that moment of like knowing yourself was that within the mind or outside of the mind it felt outside well i guess like knowing that i was knowing my mind was in my not my mind but myself was in my mind but like the actual event was past it you know yeah so so what i'm hearing is that you had some kind of experience that was we use the word sometimes transcendent does that make sense so it's kind of beyond mind and then later your mind made sense of it yeah yeah right so the way that you put together your beliefs beliefs happen within the mind but then you know these experiences happen outside of it so yeah and this is where uh do you mind if i ask how old you are i'm 21 okay and this is the kind of thing where like you know i'd sort of say that you've had a lot of bad stuff happen to you um and it can be very common for your mind to feel hopeless does that make sense yeah but i also think i know it's kind of weird but like i i think that uh your mind especially when it's hopeless is not a very good predictor of the future does that make sense probably true what do you think about that you're more than welcome to disagree um i mean it makes sense it's just like one of those places you know where like i haven't talked to any of my friends about it because i know like anything they say is not going to touch it you know what do you mean by that it is just like if they're gonna try to say positive things and i just know i'm in a space where like it's not gonna resonate you know yeah even if like objectively i i can say that the hopelessness probably isn't definitive actually of like what's gonna happen i don't know yep yeah so let's talk about that for a second so objectively it may not be accurate but it feels overwhelming yeah right the the objectivity of the situation doesn't friggin matter yeah what what's how do you understand that i don't know how to make like make myself come back to the surface i guess you know yeah so so that sounds sounds like you're drowning i feel like it yeah so i i you know i think leia my heart goes out to you it genuinely does i'm hopeful for you and i don't expect you to be hopeful for yourself um and i think that's okay what do you think about that so how did you how did you come to start hoping for stuff on monday i just felt like i think i had um i just felt like things were going to get better or like i saw good things could happen nothing specific just like i think good things are going to happen from now on you know something good will happen yeah you'll catch a break so things were looking up yeah yeah and oddly enough that's probably what made all these different challenges so much worse probably yeah right is that you you were foolish enough to hope for a few days and look at where it got you leia where did it get you so this is what i'd say first thing leia is i'm i'm really really happy that you were able to do some meditation and you were able to have this transcendent experience um i would encourage you to continue meditating are you able to do that do you think actually yes i'm sorry do you say mentally yes technically yes that's just one of those things where you got to like do it yeah so so that it's a really good point right so i think sometimes so this is the tricky thing about meditation is that oftentimes we meditate for something the problem is that if you're meditating for something you'll open it up to feelings of hopelessness i don't know if that sort of makes sense because if i'm meditating for a purpose and then i start to believe that that purpose isn't possible then the hopelessness will infect the meditative practice like having expectations yeah not not sorry expectations yeah but like if i'm meditating let's say i'm meditating to help with my adhd and then if i start meditating and my adhd doesn't get better what happens to my motivation for meditating right it cripples absolutely what a great word cripples right so i know it sounds kind of weird but i think that like being able to meditate in spite of not having any reason is going to be a really important step forward for you because i i think the main thing here is going to be the more that you can ground yourself in that transcendent experience and it'll come again if you keep at it if it happened to you once like whatever happened in your brain can absolutely happen again and i think that that place will be a source of strength for you so that place can sort of help you understand that like the hopelessness in your mind is completely valid and also may not be correct does that make sense yeah the other thing to consider is that you know some of what you're feeling is probably like honestly like a natural consequence of what you've been through so as you take like emotional critical hit do you play games yeah so as you get emotionally critically hit again and again and again you're gonna be like you know your health bars flashing like your character has like some debuffs and things like that and that's like basically it sounds like the state that you're in right now is that how it feels yeah [Music] and so the the kind of weird thing is the good news is that in a weird way i think time is actually like on your side because i just don't think statistically this kind of crap is going to keep happening to you i feel like it has like my whole life but i get what you mean yeah tell me about that so maybe maybe i'm wrong i don't know i just feel like i've always been going through [Music] like traumatic events or like obviously not like the worst tragic traumatic events you could go through but like you know still bad um so it just feels like i never catch a break you know or like i do for like those two days and then it's like oh reality check i don't know yeah so that that's where one of two possibilities is there one is that you're just genuinely screwed in terms of karma the other thing to consider though is that the mind's ability to notice the good and notice the bad can be adjusted so sometimes like there are people who will have like you know one good thing happen and one bad thing happen it's kind of like if you think about like get you know if i if i take a test and i answer 89 questions right and 11 questions wrong all everyone focuses on is the 11 questions i got wrong does that make sense yeah do you think you could be doing that uh i mean there is joy in the little things yeah okay so i'm hearing i'm hearing no so so so that's what i'm hearing there leia is there's joy in the little things but there's crap in the big ones i know yeah that that sounds that sounds bad dude yeah i mean i'm just i just feel like i'm surviving and like i mean i have my cat and like that's like yeah so what i'm hearing is that you've got consolation prizes but you don't have like the real prizes not yet help me understand the yet in that statement i feel like i'm always thinking like you know at some point there's gotta be you know it's got to get better at some point yeah something's got to give basically yeah i i for what it's worth i agree with that i know it can be hard to hold on to that hope when you're kind of getting fatty crit after fatty crit yeah right and left and i i really applaud essentially your resilience like because it's not easy to even hold on to that much hope and it's it's actually okay to feel hopeless from time to time from what for what it's worth i i do think that like karmically like you know your life should get better at some point yeah but it sounds tough what do you do to sort of how do you manage these kinds of feelings um [Music] right now i'm isolating which is bad but probably um [Music] this is like the i mean it's been a few days now i just haven't talked to anyone about so talking to you is like oh i don't know um [Music] other than that i'm how does it trying to do art but okay so i'm i'm hearing that all the stuff that you should be doing right like oh like oh leah you're feeling bad about yourself paint a picture and do some art therapy meditate earlier do all of the things and pull yourself out of the darkness with all of your effort yeah exactly i'm eating and sleeping and yeah yeah i lay it's i don't know it's okay to get owned for a little while you know for what it's worth i'm glad you called in today how do you feel about that yeah i am too it's just i didn't expect to be here or talking to you and it's just like i don't know i was like i was wanting someone to tell me good things and i don't know it's just crazy what are you getting from this conversation am i telling you good things not i mean kind of you're saying that you're hopeful and it is just crazy because i the you know i've been listening to your podcast like every day for like a couple months or a few months so it's just surreal you know yeah so i i don't know if like talking to me right now is like is good luck or bad luck like i don't know if this is like positive karma in the sense that oh you get to talk to dr k maybe this is a lucky break for you or it's like actually like bad rng because i can't tell you something to magically fix your life so you got to talk to talk to dr k and even that didn't turn everything around like which is it i don't i don't expect you to turn everything around i don't i don't mean lucky in like a weird way just that someone who's helped me so much with like feeling hope in the past and like you're here now and it does make me feel like hopeful you know i don't know if this makes sense or i you know i i don't quite get it but i don't know that i need to i'm sorry no seriously i think the important thing is that you know so here's what i'm here's what i'm hearing from you leia first of all like you've had a a really crappy week basically where there's like national stuff that is is really really concerning for your future and the autonomy of your body that's bad enough there was a romantic rejection which is also bad sounds like stuff on the job front isn't going ideal and it sounds like friends and family have recently dealt with death that you kind of got like front and center right when you went home and so you're kind of getting like bodied on all sides and i think that like you know it's kind of interesting because feeling hopeless in a situation like this is actually like pretty normal yeah and and i i think you've sort of retreated into yourself and you're kind of like hibernating which is also okay and i'm really really glad that you probably stepped out of your comfort zone a little bit and decided to come here today and talk about it a little bit like i i see you making taking steps forward does that make sense yeah so i'm sorry i can't fix everything for you i i really wish i could i wish i could give you a hug that would that's really what i think you need more than anything else right now um and also like there are things that i'm i'm really kind of hopeful about which is sort of weird i know that in terms of my spiritual understanding like suffering was a huge huge part of forcing me to like look at my life and really figure out what was important to me and like what i cared about as well as sort of understanding like how to influence my mind and stuff like and i sort of see that in your path as well that you sort of had this meditative experience and now you're going through all of this crap and like it's hard for me to describe in any other way but what gives me hope is that people who have transcendent transcend transcendental experiences in meditation and then go through a bunch of crap are the ones that actually do the best like three to five years out interesting i've seen that pattern time and time and time again and there's probably like some kind of bias there because you know i'm a psychiatrist so sometimes the people that come to me are really in despair and then they sort of have this transcendent transcendent experience and then like i think now is the time leia where you've really got to figure out and you don't have to do this all at once but like what life is like what does it mean to exist what does it mean like what part of you is real what's your body what's your mind what's your soul and then hopefully through that process you'll also begin to understand like the influence of karma karma on this cycle that you're kind of going through and things like that in terms of like these are all things that if you believe in the theory of karma and reincarnation this is sort of like you're paying off all of your bad debts and this is what's really really challenging for a lot of people is they think that like you know paying off a debt sucks definitely because you put in time and effort and then you don't get anything for for it you know but it doesn't continue forever what continues forever is if you continue making bad decisions right what do you think about all that random crap i just threw your way it i mean it makes me wonder you know cause i've thought a lot all right tried to think about like karma and like you know are all these things because of i don't know just why you know good i i think that's that's what i understand yeah so oddly enough like that makes me hopeful for you because like to be 21 and to ask why and here's the thing that i want you to really think about like if you were if your life was like completely average you would not be asking why with the desperation that you are does that make sense yeah if it doesn't let me know oh it does i just yeah so so and this is what makes me hopeful is that that desperation is absolutely necessary for true spiritual growth like buddha had that desperation he was asking why his situation was a little bit luckier than yours in the sense that he had everything and it sounds like in some ways you've got nothing although i think you've got a lot actually so it sounds like you have family you've got a cat you've got friends who care about you you have us here at the hg community right so yeah um and and i think as you continue to ask that why and then like the other thing i do i'd say is like start taking care of yourself maybe a little bit better it's fine to have you know isolate for a little while but like i want you to really think a little bit about concretely like what you can manage in terms of like you know taking a walk or meditating like what do you think you can do despite the fact that you're feeling pretty down and hopeless is there something you think you can do like in terms of taking care of yourself or supporting your body or mind a little bit better um i don't know i feel like i'm doing trying to i mean probably like talking to my friends okay would be good or um like when i get a new job it'll be easier what makes it hard to do those things get a new job or talk to your friends well the friends thing is like because i've been feeling this such intense heavy feeling i don't want them to feel responsible for like um how i feel or what i do you know i don't want them to feel like they have to fix things for me or anything okay because i know like i said i've i know like it is at such a level that i know if they try it's it's gonna just pull them into my hopelessness that i feel or like it sounds like you care about your friends a lot and you're almost trying to protect them from you yeah yeah yeah what do you think about that yeah i don't know it's tough i know they're going through so much like and i feel like my feeling this way is just gonna pull them down you know what do you think they would say about that they would want me to talk to them but i just don't see it being productive sometimes okay so as someone who's had a transcendent transcendent experience you don't see it as being productive what is the you in that sentence that's my mind and how much can you trust your mind right now not very much i guess wow so i'll give you one do you want to explain the wow uh just like uh realizing over and over like oh i can't really trust my thoughts at the moment yeah but it's interesting which is pretty cool because your recognition that you can't trust your thoughts is like pretty neat right so you can sort of trust them yeah you just yeah right it's like no no you can't trust your mind therefore you can't trust the conclusion that you can't trust your mind so yeah so this is the lay this is how purification of the mind works right so like a tiny part of your mind just got purified and and this is where like this is where i kind of say that this you know your life has given you good karma and negative karma and it's your friend's karma to deal with your crap and i want you to go into that interaction so first of all i want you to reach out to your friends secondly i want you to reach out to your friends mentally prepared for what's going to happen you're going to feel guilty agreed yeah they're going to try to help you are they going to problem solve validate or both both so when they problem solve what is your mind going to do to the problem solving resistant which is okay and when they validate what is your mind going to do i don't know i just feel like okay uh so your mind may resist that too yeah in a way right or just be indifferent to it kind of yeah so so let let yourself be loved by your friends right and if you feel guilty because they're helping you first of all they signed up for that crap when they decided to be your friend so that's part of their karma and also this is the kind of thing where i want you to accept their help and also pay it back yeah right so we've got two options to be karmically neutral one is that they don't help you and you don't help them or they help you and you help them yeah and this is the kind of thing where what i see in society today is that like we all need each other's help so are you getting help through this conversation i think so are you helping other people through this conversation potentially i feel like there's a lot of hopelessness in the world right now and people probably relate to that i think you're helping people a lot what do you think about that that makes me want to like cry yeah i'm cheering up too what's going on i don't know can i ask you a question sure um spiritually [Laughter] they're not bad tears i'm just surprised oh my god okay go ahead are you okay dr candy you need to talk yeah i know i'm talking about it i i can feel my feelings um you had a question yeah so like uh so the spiritual stuff i don't know where to go with it basically like i recognize like i have a soul and that you know there's probably all i mean karma and stuff but like i don't know where to go with that it's a great question so um here are a couple things that i'd recommend the first is that you continue practicing so like ultimately like the most important thing is going to be your experience because when you like experience things in meditation that's like the core of the knowledge but there's also another component which is i think what you're asking about which is like how do you make sense of what happens to you in meditation is that what you're kind of looking for yeah yeah so i'd say there are two things you should do one is you should try to find a sangha so a community of some kind so see if like i you know i'm not going to ask you where you live in the united states um you know because doxxing and all that but so like there's got to be some kind of like meditation center community temple like whatever in your area like even in the most you know i'm from texas and like texas is not very in a sense pro meditation but there there's a ton of meditation stuff like all over the us now so i i know it's going to feel kind of like anxiety provoking but i would just go to one of those places or call one of those places and say hey i'm interested in learning more about meditation do you all have like lectures or like whatever so you can go to just any place and start getting exposure and that's where basically your karma will sort of like set you up for this kind of stuff where you may find you know a couple places in your area try a couple and just go there and just see if you like the vibe yeah the other thing that you can do is is read so i think um you know like a lot of good meditation teachers that are introductory like alan watts is really good um there's also like uh you can sort of read like a commentary on patanjali's yoga sutras it's a little bit in a sense advanced because there's a lot of like esoteric concepts in there but i like um uh the bhagavad gita by eknat is like a very very good introductory concept introductory book for western people like who don't like sort of didn't grow up with this culture that's a real generally speaking regarded as a religious text from the hindu tradition so if that rubs you the wrong way you don't have to do that um i don't know how to spell that that's totally fine i think tech teller's gonna hook you up with both of those okay thank you so much i'd start with you know a couple of books and then and then actually try to go like hang out with people who meditate and they probably will have like lectures and stuff thank you so much that's really helpful you're very welcome leia okay we have a visitor okay avi daddy's working sweetie oh oh you're so hungry okay uh sweetie okay oh sweet you can't hit me what a little bit okay i think i'm gonna have to go for a second so i i'm gonna say goodbye to you okay okay do you want to say hi to leia hello elea is feeling sad because she had some bad stuff happen to her what do we do for people who are feeling sad i
