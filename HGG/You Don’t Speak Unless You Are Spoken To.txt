some people don't understand this because their comfort zone breaking out of their comfort zone is not that hard whereas for some of us breaking out of our comfort zone is very hard it's like i have a phobia of snakes great we're going to have you swimming in a pit of snakes in three months right they're like oh i like dug deep and i overcame i went to a job interview i did it and then what happens the next day does the anxiety go away no it comes roaring back the reason that you think other people are going to be inconvenienced by you comes from you it doesn't come from them but what's the one thing that you haven't accounted for is your own mind and how it's gonna like wreck you if you try so i don't talk unless people talk to me how do i change that i started college last week it's a course i enjoy and the classes and professors are fun for a while now i was fantasizing about going back to college so i'd finally break the cycle of being 24 7 stuck at home with no human contact and here i am and i'm underwhelmed i dropped out of my previous course because of depression and mostly because i had no contact with anyone there and i fear i'm headed to the same route now i finally understand the problem though not at its root i do not engage in any interaction with anyone unless the person does it first i simply remain quiet completely silent everyone in the class seems to be getting along and i feel behind i'm unable to start a conversation or let go of my inner voice that always prevents me from saying anything because it might look stupid i know i need to break through the comfort zone but i can't it just does not apply in practice i simply cannot enjoy talking to people let alone when we don't know each other yet i always feel like i'm bothering them when most are already in groups and i'm just there floating around this is more of a vent than anything so this is a fantastic post my heart goes out to this person so this is the challenge is that we know that we're supposed to like engage with people right and we even want to engage with people we feel lonely we feel isolated we know that like human contact is important and we also sort of hear about people like breaking out of their comfort zone right so we sort of have this idea that like okay like i need to just get over this anxiety or i just need to get over myself i just need to step outside of my comfort zone i need to put myself out there right we sit like we hear things like this people who don't suffer from these kinds of things will say things like this to us they'll say just put yourself out there bro girl just put yourself out there right but the problem is that like we can't because like that solution works for that person because the hump that they have to get over is a lot smaller than the hump that we have to get over or what we end up concluding is that the hump is the same but i'm just so much you know my ability to climb is so much lower that i can't do it and then i start to feel bad about myself right so this is a really common problem where people like are kind of stuck in this wanting a relationship but sort of passively waiting for it to show up and even then strategically you know it's the wrong idea like you know that you should be putting yourself out there but you can't really bring yourself to do that so what i'd love to do today is walk through a couple of things with y'all okay the first is what the hell is going on in your mind like how does this work right what happens in our mind why does our mind prevent us because that's actually what it's doing right because you want to make connections with other people why does our mind prevent us from reaching out to other people speaking up what are some of the mechanisms that go on in the mind that keep us from engaging with other people how can we understand those and then we're also going to introduce you to a couple of like cognitive things that you can do this sort of draws on basically exposure therapy to sort of think a little bit about what that hump is and how you can reduce that hump to position yourself to re-engage with people socially okay so we're going to start by understanding okay what's going on in the mind so the first thing that you all have to understand is that when we are inexperienced with something our mind is going to fill it in with possibilities and because the mind fills it in with possibilities and has no experience it has no way of assigning probability to the possibility so if i've never you know gone swimming before my mind is naturally going to fill it in with like all kinds of stuff could happen if i go swimming and generally speaking if we have an anxious temperament depending on what kind of some scars we have depending on our five factor personality level like if we're high on neuroticism the things that my mind tends to fill it in with tend to be negative right because that's how the mind works so our brain has evolved to sort of assume the worst they're like safe things which we all do and then they're like things that we tend to not do too much so if we look at people who like are explorers right explorers are like the mid like the smaller section of our population most of the people that have existed didn't board a boat and just see what's out there so generally speaking exploration is discouraged in some ways by the mind unless it's a very safe way to do it and generally speaking when there's an unknown our mind fills it in with the most negative possibilities and why is that it's to try to protect us right because if we don't know what's going to happen think about all the things that are going to go wrong we know if we don't talk to anyone like sure we're going to be kind of miserable but like at least we'll be safe and what the mind prioritizes more than anything else and i think this is evolutionary as well is safety right so it's like the body the brain the mind prioritizes safety this is why for example if you look at your favorite restaurant so let's say you go to a restaurant you eat there 20 times and you love the food every single time if you get food sickness food poisoning once the 21st time you go out to eat you get food poisoning like what's going to happen you're not going to want to eat there again right so our brain is actually biased doesn't say oh by the way we're going to food poisoning five percent of the time like it doesn't make a probabilistic calculation that's not how the mind works the mind works by like single things that are very negative have a larger weight in our experience in our behavioral calculations than all of the positive stuff right so another way a simple way to think about it is let's say i've been married for 20 years and i found out my partner has been having an affair for the last six months that's the kind of thing where it's like you can still have 20 years of good marriage and if you discover an affair that's been lasting for six months it kind of wipes away all the all the good with a couple of bad things or maybe not a couple i'm not saying that that's a necessarily a bad thing i'm not trying to place a value judgment i'm simply pointing out that there's a mechanism of mind that like one bad experience is way stronger than like a pile of good experiences so that's a bias that our brain has so when we get socially kind of anxious we don't talk to anyone that tends to be because our mind is imagining all this bad stuff so let's take a quick look at this post right so um let's look at this so breaking the cycle because i have no contact with anyone i fear i'm headed down the same route everyone in class seems to be getting along and i feel behind right so that's where we start to think like oh my god i'm i'm kind of like a loser like we start to have negative identity thoughts about ourselves my inner voice that always prevents me from saying anything because it might look stupid there it is right so what is that inner voice actually telling you the inner voice is trying to protect you it's saying hey this is unsafe don't do it i know i need to break through the comfort zone but i can't it's not a comfort zone it's safety zone um and i cannot it doesn't apply in practice i always feel like i'm bothering them most when most groups are already there and i'm just floating around right so all of these negative thoughts kind of come up and they start to get in the way of us actually doing things so let's take a quick look at what how we sort of tackle this problem okay so can't initiate conversation so here's you here's the activation energy to initiate a conversation okay that looks let's do make it straighter i'm at an angle oh no okay so here's the activation energy so in order to engage in something for those of y'all that are familiar with like chemical reactions and stuff there's this idea of an activation energy right and actually if we want to be legitimate around chemical stuff this is actually what the curve should look like right so we end up we start here and we end up lower so moving from a high energy state to a low energy state so this is the gap that we have to overcome in order to initiate the behavior so let's try to understand what that gap is so for our friends who say oh just put yourself out there their gap is gonna be like smaller okay so like when they say oh like just put yourself out there their gap is like this right that's why it feels easy to them and they're like oh like sure there's like there's some activation energy i know exactly what you're talking about there's an activation energy for me too you just have to get over it but what we face and what they face is a little bit different so let's try to understand what are the components of this hump that we have to go over okay so even if we look back at our post what we're going to sort of find is that there are particular there's a lack of experience and in that lack of experience we're going to have doomsday scenarios right and this in turn makes us want to be safe so it's actually a feeling of safety here okay next thing to kind of consider is there's an identity component right other people are social but when we start to say things like fallen behind if y'all have been paying attention to our content and watching and stuff like that you recognize that this is a comparison a comparison is born of the ego or the ahamkar and this in turn is an identity issue do you all see that so it's like you can chain this stuff very easily right and so then there are also like some of these doomsday scenarios like we'll talk kind of more specifically here but there's this idea that i'm bothering people there's also the concern that i'll look like an idiot so how do we overcome this stuff right so a couple of different things that we can do to lower this activation energy the first thing is that as we sort of deal with some of these things as we address these issues it should lower the activation energy so even in something like exposure therapy so let's talk about exposure therapy for a second what's the what's the principle behind exposure therapy okay so the principle behind exposure therapy is that what we want to do is like give you more data points so let's say that i have one data point i eat at a restaurant once and i get sick right i just have one data point and that data point is sickness and therefore i'm not going to engage in the behavior because like i had a really bad experience right so let's say let's use a kind of a better example so let's talk about exposure therapy of like a phobia of let's say dogs okay so i was bitten by a dog when i was a kid and i got terrified and so now i'm scared of dogs so any time that we have a hypothetical encounter with a dog what our safety circuit fills it in with is negative possibilities right all we have is these negative possibilities and really all we have is is let's call it one actual negative experience so this is our negative experience okay but then we have all these negative possibilities that we'll we're kind of like filling it in with so the goal of exposure therapy is to try to have these kind of neutral sort of experiences that we're going to fill it in with and then what happens is like the balance will start to change right it won't be all negative so the way that exposure therapy will work is what we're going to want to do is we're going to sort of think about a dog and this works physiologically okay so when i think about a dog when someone when a patient is sitting in my office and i tell them think about a dog what starts to happen they have a sympathetic nervous system reaction so what does this mean this means adrenaline increased heart rate increased blood pressure diaphoresis sweating right tachypnea that's elevated respiratory rate hyperventilation we have all these kinds of physiologic things and then what happens is the brain gets this exposure of thinking about a dog has this physiologic reaction and then nothing happens so the brain is like i thought we were in danger okay so there's no reinforcement of the danger and then when they come back next week we're gonna think about the dog again okay we're just thinking about the dog but this time there's a little bit less sympathetic reaction because we thought about the dog and nothing bad happened so our body's like okay not that big of a deal maybe i don't need to freak out as much then what we're going to do is we're going to elevate the exposure then we're gonna look at pictures of dogs and now instead of just thought what we're what we're adding is actually like a sensory organ sort of activation and then we're gonna go sit on a park bench or maybe go sit inside a coffee shop that'll probably be safer look outside at dogs playing but there's a wall of glass right and then so what happens is like this is to increase our sympathetic nervous system right so we're going to get that reaction and then like the more we sort of what we're gradually going to do is then we're going to go sit on a park bench and then that person like the patient is going to have a rapid heart rate they're going to be like freaking out right they're outside of their comfort zone so like what we gradually do is we get like closer and closer to like encountering a dog but we do it sort of in a safe manner okay so and then what happens is like remember that the mind has no experience or it has a limited experience and so by adding a lot of other data points that are benign we make it easier to engage in the task does that make sense can you do this with women absolutely you can do this with women okay we're gonna talk i mean i hope that's okay to say what i mean by that i don't know if you're a man or a woman but you can do this with social interactions let's call it that way let's let's say that okay so let's talk a little bit about how to actually do this so the goal here is that we want to have an increase in benign social interactions so there are four things that we can do four things that we can focus on to make it easy okay when we'll talk i may have opened a can of worms by answering a question from chat but we'll get to that in a second okay i'll try to fix that and hopefully not offend people so let's kind of focus on the core principles so increase in benign social interactions that's our goal so what we want to think about first of all is what will the social interaction be okay we want to lay that out and that's usually where people stop right so when people are like oh i just need to do this so they just think about the action and they stop there they don't explore any of the resistance that their mind will come across the second thing that we need to look at is self-image what will people think so i would recommend concretely asking yourself so let's use let's start small right so what we're going to do is say hello to the person next to you in class next to you and then we have to get more specific than this because what does hello mean right so when i'm actually working with patients what we need to do is be concrete so what we're going to say is hey how are you today that's what we're actually going to say so what feels natural so think through actually what you're going to say is it going to be hello or is it going to be hello right so is it going to be a elder scrolls npc or is it going to be hey how are how are you today you know like what are you actually going to say what feels comfortable so you have to think through that a little bit and even as you're thinking through it what what are you going to get you're getting a sympathetic reaction okay or you could say how howdy hello citizen right um have you heard of the thalmor the glory of the thalmor is that hello traveler right so then so don't say zug zug because we're going to get into problems with self-image so then you got to think a little bit about how are they going to perceive you if you say hey how you doing because what happens is in the absence of this cognitive exploration your mind is going to fill it in with like random negative things they're going to think i'm trying they're going to think i'm a complete creep no they're not right so if you really like think about it logically and you engage with your mind you may feel that way you may feel awkward but what are they actually going to think if you say hey how are you doing today right so just think through it grapple with it and this is where some ego stuff is going to come up so like how are they going to think about you and then think just think through that a little bit like so your mind may start with saying they're going to think you're a complete idiot and then just sort of question that and be like ask yourself if someone walked up to me and said hey hey how are you doing today you know and i was sitting next to them and maybe if they walked up to me on the street it would be weird but they're sitting next to me and they said hey how are you doing today like does that really bother me no like it doesn't really bother me so think through that next thing that we want to do is think through the consequences of taking action so what is actually going to happen so we want to think about what the interaction is going to be we want to think about you know what people are going what what how are p how will people view me so you want to think through self-image and then you want to think about what are the actual consequences like what are people going to do if i say hey how are you today and it's not going to be like oh they're going to stop showing up at class because i said hello to them like that's not gonna happen right whereas in a non-structured cognitive way if you let your mind run wild it'll actually think thoughts like that right it'll think like oh i'm they're gonna feel so inconvenienced by me but if we really think about it the reason that you think other people are going to be inconvenienced by you comes from you it doesn't come from them right it comes from your own idea your self-image that you are a burden to other people so that's where the ego component comes in so think through the actual consequence then what we want to do is anticipate internal challenges so if i were to stop there and say go say hi to someone the next time you're in class not good enough because you've thought through all this stuff right but what's the one thing that you haven't accounted for is your own mind and how it's gonna like wreck you if you try so what is my mind going to do this is the next very important question you need to ask yourself right what is gonna happen okay i'm gonna feel sweaty right i'm gonna feel awkward i'm gonna feel bothersome and then kind of think through a little bit like okay what what could i say or what could i do that would make me feel less of these things even if i felt this way what could i get away with right what could i convince myself or push myself to do because what you may just discover is that you know like something like this is actually is going to make you feel so awkward and so uncomfortable that you know like it's too much to handle so then maybe what you need to do is like downplay like what you kind of do so maybe the you know there are all kinds of modifications you can make so you have to remember that like instead of trying to overcome yourself so this is what tends to happen is we try to overcome ourselves and then we create internal conflict in the mind when we create internal conflict in the mind that does not increase our relaxation it increases tension in the mind ramps up our internal energy and the more that our energy is ramped up and the less relaxed we are the more it boosts our anxiety so if you all have seen dr k's guide to anxiety you sort of know this with rebound anxiety which is like this problem where like people run into this issue where they overcome their anxiety right they're like oh i like dug deep and i overcame i went to a job interview i did it and then what happens the next day does the anxiety go away no it comes roaring back right so what you have to do is work with yourself instead of trying to overcome yourself because the part of you that feels unsafe is going to come roaring back okay you can sort of bludgeon it into submission with enough time so if you create enough experience that can get better but generally speaking what we want to do is work with ourselves right so if you're if there's a part of you that's like yeah that's like that's too much i can't handle that then be like okay so what can i handle so maybe this is something as simple as like sit in the same chair twice with someone else the same person sitting next to you so sit next to this person like three days in a row you're not sitting next to the person you're just sitting in the same chair because in my head in my anxious head i'm so afraid that people are gonna think that i'm trying to sit next to them that i keep on moving around right like i create all of these ways in my head that i inconvenience the rest of the world and then what i try to do is like stop inconveniencing the rest of the world in my head so i start sitting in a thousand different places and then i'm sort of doing everyone a favor by like not sitting next to them right so you need to think through your own internal challenges that that are going to arise and prepare for them once you do that then you actually want to take the action right so this is where what i'd recommend is if you're really like in a school situation it's not sufficient to sit you know to say hello or like that's not enough like you need to do more and don't worry i'm it's not going to be bad so what i'd recommend if you're kind of socially anxious is that you find other scenarios because let's say that you have a class that's monday wednesday friday if you say hello on monday and then on tuesday you're just anxious all day it's going to be harder to do it on wednesday where you say hello and then you felt so awkward that you're anxious all day and then on friday you managed to say hello but your voice cracks because you rile yourself up and then you're traumatized going into the weekend and then monday rolls around and yeah we're done with that your mind is like yeah we're done with that so this is another common mistake that people make is that like they they think oh i've tried this i've tried this i've tried this it doesn't work it doesn't work it doesn't work and they're not wrong right like they're not wrong this is your experience the question is why is that your experience the question is how can you change it so what i'd recommend if you've been socially isolated is that you ramp up your activity and you mortify people in different situations so even on monday we're gonna say hey how are you but then on monday afternoon when we go go to the grocery store we're gonna like make like we're gonna say thank you to the person the cashier right if the waiter let's say you go out to eat with some of your close friends who you can socialize with you're going to ask them you know what's good here and then you're gonna feel super awkward right what are the internal challenges the waiter is like oh yeah the sandwiches are really good here but you don't want to eat a sandwich then what do you do you're screwed because the waiter said the sandwiches are good and i'm not gonna order a sandwich then why the hell did i even ask if i'm not gonna follow their recommendation so think about these things right it's okay right so it's okay so like you're gonna ask for the recommendation and then if you really want to oh thanks for recommending i'm not feeling a sandwich today so you're gonna prepare okay thanks for the recommendation not really up my alley or if you want to go like you know super chad mode you can even say like i know it's super bizarre i asked you for a recommendation now i feel like an idiot ordering something else you can even joke if you want to and go meta with them right you'll get that like you just say like i've done that before because i feel like an idiot asking and then you know not ordering what they say you know like they don't care like they're not gonna lose sleep over tonight you may lose sleep over it tonight but you can just they offer a small explanation if you want to you can say like oh like thanks for the recommendation you know what this salad sounds amazing i think i'm gonna try that you know just it's not that big of a deal feels like that big of a deal so you need to think about multiple interactions we want to actually kind of pace them up right so monday wednesday friday we're going to say hello to people that we sit next to we may even ramp up a little bit we're going to say hello how are you friday you can ask oh yeah have you like tried the homework yet right you can sort of ask that one day you can by the way i never got a chance to introduce myself easy so this is another like there are techniques you can use so i don't know if you all have ever gotten to this kind of social anxiety trap which is that i've been making small talk with this person and like i don't know their name and they don't know my name so now i don't know how to interact with them because i feel like i should know their name and it's been two weeks and now we're like gg so then like you're like i don't know how to ask this person their name because it's too late now so i guess i'll go sit on the other side of the room and and just you know never speak to them again right and so then you know you don't want to walk up to them and say like hey you're an npc so i don't know your name no you want to say hey i didn't get a chance to introduce myself right and you can say didn't get a chance and what how are they going to feel when you say that they're going to feel relieved because they don't know your name either because you'll never introduce yourselves you just started talking and they're like oh thank god because every week they're coming into the class they're like oh [ __ ] that guy's gonna sit next to me again and i don't remember his name i don't remember his name i don't remember his name right like they're gonna be relieved oh by the way i didn't get a chance to introduce myself or if i did introduce myself i'm sorry i didn't i didn't catch your name it slipped my mind can you please remind me what was your name again whatever feels comfortable so i i personally i keep track of this kind of stuff so i'll say like you know i didn't get a chance to introduce myself hi my name is and then you can kind of do that right and so if you have these other kinds of social interactions remember what we're doing here's our vacuum of experience of human experience that our social anxiety is filling in with doomsday scenarios right and so when we have a waiter conversation it's over not even conversation we say hi to the waiter we thank the cashier we say hi to someone in class um you know there are other things that you can just like whatever opportunities you have for brief social interactions like very very brief social interactions right like if you're waiting on the bus you can just like nod to someone like don't you know don't make it weird gender wise you're just like nod to someone so like i i'm a big fan of the bron right depending on what you're into you can be the down knot or the up nod so it could be like a you know like i acknowledge you i see you as a human and you're a good person right and so that that's kind of you know that may be a bit much for other people but whatever you feel good with cashiers grocery stores family members you know like whatever you feel comfortable with and you want to try to pack in as much mild social interaction as you can within one week okay like don't just do like one thing every 48 hours like try to have small things with people who will never talk to each other so they can't because there's the thing oh my god like you won't believe the weirdest person talked to me at the bus stop oh that guy's i took a picture of him he's in my class oh and then the rest of the world is conspiring and talking about you behind your back about how socially awkward you are and they go to a party and their friend is the cashier from the grocery store and their friend is also the one and then his roommate is the waiter and all four of them are gonna talk and they're gonna realize like there's like oh man i met the most awkward [ __ ] this guy came to my restaurant today and asked me what was good i told him with sandwich this [ __ ] ordered us uh a salad here i i got a copy of the security footage and we could compare to the picture of the guy that like that's not gonna happen right you all get that like that's just not gonna happen but that's what your mind does and why does it do that it's because it's got nothing else to fill it in with y'all get that like there's none of this over here it's all gone so then what happens what happens with social anxiety this is what happens with social anxiety i don't know if you guys know this this is what happens nightmare scenarios and i'm like oh like oh my god and then it becomes this whole big thing in your head and then this is where the hump comes from right so by having these mild social interactions what tends to happen is this i mean sorry we reduce this so what happens when we have mild we break this up right oh like this gets kind of broken up and the nightmare scenario kind of disappears we lower the hump a little bit we're going to prep for it cognitively we're going to recognize hey this is going to be tough it's going to be hard it's going to make me feel uncomfortable i'm going to get all sweaty that's okay it's really not okay but i'm gonna do it anyway i'm gonna do what i can manage right so i'm gonna ask myself okay what can i manage right and if you can't if it's too terrifying to ask the waiter what's good you can say when the waiter asks you at the end of your meal they're like how was everything oh everything was fantastic thank you you could say that i think you can get away with that right we're not going to get to like some of the harder stuff because then later on when dr k really wants to screw with his patients who have social anxiety not really but it's part of the fun of working with people right then it's like next time you go to the restaurant and a waiter asks you how was everything because they've done like step one step two step three step four step five step six they're like okay i'm good at talking to people not great so the next time you're unsatisfied with something at a restaurant tell them when they ask you how it was everything how's that oh everything was great my fish was undercooked and inedible let them know right just let them know just be like hey i thought this is like i thought it was light on the seasoning to be honest oh i'm so sorry about that no no big deal you know maybe try it you know you don't have to say it was horrible because oftentimes like restaurants and waiters and chefs and lion cooks appreciate feedback right they want to know if they're like doing something wrong instead they just keep on getting you know three-star reviews on on google or yelp and they're like they're just forking over money to yelp i suppose try to fix the problem um okay so does that make sense so really really common so let's kind of summarize so we run into this scenario where we don't know how to talk to people unless they talk to us and this is where like our friends who are more socially comfortable than we are will say get out of your comfort zone right i need to break through the comfort zone but i can't and why is that it's harder than it appears to be so some people don't understand this because their comfort zone breaking out of their comfort zone is not that hard whereas for some of us breaking out of our comfort zone is very hard and so what are the factors that go into that the first just a lack of experience that the mind in order to keep us safe populates our head with hypotheticals okay second thing we have to watch out for if we've been this way for a while there may be identity related stuff going on the hump god may be active we may be comparing ourselves to other people it's so easy for other people people i am such a bother right so when your mind starts thinking that way it's not that my conversation is boring it's that i am boring so there's a difference between like when you identify with something and like you know some attributes like i suck at dancing whereas like i am a bad person right there's a big difference between when we get identified when we identify with something and so then we have all these thoughts like i'm bothering people so if you want to deal with this what you want to do is we're going to draw like the general principle of exposure therapy is that we want to have a graduated exposure to things which is terrifying and there's nothing more terrifying to someone with a phobia than exposure therapy they're like you gotta be freaking kidding me like exposure therapy has such a pr problem it's like i have a phobia of snakes great we're gonna have you swimming in a pit of snakes in three months fantastic and i wonder why people don't come back okay so generally speaking it's because we have all these hypotheticals and what we want to do is create safe situations that create a physiologic response which then we acclimatize to so we want people in exposure therapy to feel safe the entire time okay we don't want them out of there let's say here's your comfort zone here's the danger zone we don't want to move you from here to here we want to move you here and then here and then here and then the inevitability of moving over there is what terrifies people when it comes to exposure therapy so you don't have to go all the way if you don't want to okay there are four things you can do to increa to decrease that that burden that activation energy that you have to overcome first is clearly define the interaction second is think about your self-image like how what are people gonna think about me if i actually do this and don't let that answer come up naturally in your mind like it's not the first thing that your anxiety thinks of actually do like a calculated introspective exploration of if i sit next to someone and ask them how they're doing today like how are they actually going to think about it so you can even restructure that thought think about the consequences of taking the action what is actually going to happen is there going to be a party the next day where the waiter you the cashier this person from my class and this person from my class's roommate are all going to like talk about me behind my back that's not going to happen right so but think through it engage with those thoughts and then anticipate your internal challenges ask yourself what can i get away with what can i manage because you don't want to fight yourself right it's like what can you manage and the cool thing is that when you manage it then what you can also do pro tip good job you strong work hey i actually did it today like i know it was terrifying then you're gonna feel like an idiot right because like if you like said hello to someone in class you can't give yourself a pat on the back because you've fallen behind you're so socially inept that i can't you giving yourself a pat on the back for saying good job for saying hello to someone that's pathetic so watch out for that that thought right that's your ego as well so you should give yourself a pat on the back it's not easy to do notice your ego anticipate the internal challenge right be prepared for that voice that says oh that was so pathetic you had to work yourself up just to say hello you're like yeah like it's hard for me like chill bro we did it right like we moved one step forward so you can reframe that a little bit too next tip to remember is that generally speaking when people are trying to like socially integrate they'll pick one thing space it out over a long period of time like i'm gonna say hello hello on monday hello on wednesday and hello on friday you need to pick it up a little bit right so you can do more things that are less mortifying so like do a couple of different things so that you get used to more social interactions and then watch out for the nightmare scenario right because that's what your mind is going to do and if you do these kinds of things hopefully you can start engaging with people remember to go slow remember not to like it doesn't matter like don't judge i mean i say don't judge yourself your mind will try to judge you just acknowledge that say like you know hey like everyone's on their own road we all start from where we are and like whether other people are further ahead or behind or whatever like that's irrelevant i am where i am okay and just take it slow questions so this is a great question can you help me i'm i'm too sus because i think my girlfriend might just be too beautiful to be with me so that can be confusing um it's something i understand really well because i too thought my wife was too attractive to be with me and that's where like instead of assuming so this is the interesting thing if you think your partner is too attractive to be with you this is where you know you can assume that that's sort of true or you can recognize that your value is greater than what you think right possible um how to continue from hello you don't continue at the beginning okay so like you don't have to continue after the whole you can just say hello and just stop it and they're like but that's awkward because i'm not saying anything well it's like well there's another human being involved too so here's the other thing if you're socially anxious the other thing you really really need to remember is that you can't carry the whole [ __ ] conversation nor should you try to carry the whole conversation when you try to carry the whole conversation when you think to yourself first i'm going to say hello then i'm going to say this then i'm going to say this if that doesn't work i'm going to say this if that doesn't work i'm going to say that's going to lead to a terrible social interaction that terrible social interaction is going to make you feel more socially anxious going forward don't carry the whole conversation don't map everything out there's another human being involved let them carry it hello don't say anything else don't go to plan b if that's the reaction you get and they say hey how are you so if they say hey how are you you can say i'm doing well how are you i'm doing great cool enough for today right next day you go in what's up man how's your day going up none got it dude like let's see oh no what the [ __ ] is it this guy do it so don't carry the whole conversation that's where a lot of socially anxious people like get tripped up because they try to do all the work because you have to like plan for everything that's going to go wrong right so it's like this happens i got to do this i get to do this and then you're not having a conversation you're like playing it like a conversation simulator game in your head right like then it really is turning into like npc oblivion dialogue where it's like let me try this dialogue tree in this dialogue tree in this dialogue tree right so so like it's a conversation with another human being involved so don't don't play conversation simulator even though it's really comforting to do because what does conversation simulator do for us makes us feel safe if i've mapped out all the conversation i've predicted every possibility then i can go into the conversation and feel safe because no matter what i know what to say confidence doesn't come from mapping everything out ahead of time and knowing exactly what's going to happen that's closer to cheating right like confidence like if you're playing an rts in your map hacking that's not going to build your confidence because you know where everything is going to be confidence comes from playing the map blind it's like i can scout i can handle it if they're rushing like not that big of a deal like right like these conversation maps that you make in your mind is like a map hack that just reinforces your dependence on the map hack and then you can't play a regular game you
