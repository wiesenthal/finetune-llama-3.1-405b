so if I get feedback that I'm not doing very well in sales or that some of my clients are complaining about for example my attention to detail or my tardiness and responding so if we look at what happens during feedback when I get that kind of feedback I feel bad about myself right I feel kind of bad I start to it can almost be like a confirmation of the fears that I hold about myself here if you want to get control of your life and understand how the mind works check out a DIY guide to mental health the link is in description huh all right so let's talk a little bit about how to not take feedback personally or even I know it sounds kind of weird how to reject feedback so this is kind of important because sometimes like when we get feedback the first thing is we take it personally right so we think that there are circumstances that are outside of our control which result in someone giving us a piece of feedback and then we sort of take that feedback to Heart it hurts us a lot right it makes us feel bad about ourselves like a good example is if you get broken up with or someone's breaking up with you and say it's not you it's me we sort of still kind of take that feedback personally so on the one hand we kind of say oh don't take it personally has nothing to do with you so what we mean by that is that if there is feedback that does not have to relate to you specifically sometimes what we do is we make it relate directly to us but what I'm going to talk about today is a little bit different what I want you all to do is to not take feedback personally and what I mean by that is almost reject feedback that is personal so I'll give you all an example of this because this this happens way too much in in spaces like work right so sometimes people will get feedback like oh you're not a team player or you're not a go-getter and if you really stop and think about it what does that feedback mean right so if someone is not a team player like how do you fix that sometimes some of the worst and most common feedback that we get at work is very personal they say this is an attribute of who you are they say you are not a team player but it's not like I can wake up tomorrow and be a team player right you can't correct feedback by being something else someone gives you feedback that you're stupid and the best place for unconstructive personal feedback is in online gaming by the way right you suck at life uninstalled Noob that's not feedback that you can do anything about and the tricky thing is it's not just in gaming right we get this feedback at work all the time where a boss who is not very thoughtful about what you're doing wrong gives you General person-based feedback you're not a team player well what do I do about that because generally speaking if you give someone personal feedback like person-based feedback they can't change that I can't change who I am so I'd love to do today is share a little bit about first of all a little bit about in general how to deal with feedback and secondly how to almost reject personal feedback okay so don't take personal feedback so let's talk a little bit about feedback what is the ideal kind of feedback so feed the the purpose of feedback is to get people to improve right it's to give them like opportunities generally to improve and so that's one of the biggest problems that people they sort of we kind of think about feedback as okay this is what they're doing wrong but like what's the purpose of telling someone something that they're doing wrong what does that accomplish it doesn't accomplish anything unless you can also tell them how to fix it so the reason that we give negative feedback is to actually help people improve otherwise it does no good a simple example of this is that so if you look at like a test right this is one of the biggest problems with the school system if you look at a test let's say I get a c on a test and then what happens after I get a c on the test I never get any opportunity to improve on that right I get the test and then we move on to the next module so actually if we think about how we do tests our systems are not designed to actually have us improve our learning they're designed to rank us separate us but the goal isn't actually learning the goal of our current educational system is differentiation and that's something that has carried forward into the workplace and we end up getting feedback that isn't actionable so we can't actually improve and then what's the point to giving the feedback anyway right so what's the point of telling someone hey I'm sorry that uh you know your situation is that I'm sorry you're upset about your your work situation you happen to be an Egyptian slave that was born 2500 years ago and you need to be XYZ right there's no point in giving people feedback unless they can actually improve on it or act on it so what we want feedback to be let's run through what what good feedback looks like so first of all it should be constructive or actionable so it's not an attribute of yourself or personhood it's like an action that you can take the second thing that that is ideal around feedback is that feedback should be sort of measurable or trackable in some way so if I tell you that you know I want you to be better at XYZ I should also let someone know how are we going to measure that when are we going to measure that how are we going to track progress what does progress look like this is where once again if you tell someone you're not enough of a team player well what do I do tomorrow morning how do I be more of a team player there aren't particular actions I can take how are we measuring it you know and so what we'll see it work in Works spaces is people will be like oh you're not enough of a team player you need to work on that and so then the question is okay like how do I work on that how do you know that I'm working on it how do I know that I'm working on it the right way none of these questions actually get answered because we deliver this General vague feedback okay so we want feedback to be constructive actionable and measurable the other really important thing about feedback is as best as possible we want to remove our emotions and ego from the equation so if I get feedback that I'm not doing very well in sales or that some of my clients are complaining about for example my attention to detail or my tardiness and responding so if we look at what happens during feedback when I get that kind of feedback I feel bad about myself right I feel kind of bad I start to it can almost be like a confirmation of the fears that I hold about myself so if I have imposter syndrome for example and I get some kind of negative feedback what actually happens in my mind is I start to panic right because I'm like oh my God I knew I felt like an imposter I knew I was an imposter and and now what do I do because like everything that I feared actually turned out to be true all my worst fears are correct I am an imposter I don't belong here and so what does that do in our mind it sends our mind into a tailspin we start to take it personally right and what do I mean by take it personally we start to form conclusions about ourselves based on the external feedback we receive that becomes part of who I am and once it becomes part of who I am it becomes unchangeable because now it's part of my personality now it's part of my character sheet right it's not like a class skill it's a stat and it's fixed so this is what tends to happen when we get feedback so let's run through actually how to appropriately receive feedback and to a certain degree almost even how to push back against it okay so we're going to take a quick look at this so let's look at the general feedback situation so sometimes what we're going to do is we're going to see let's say we receive feedback okay and if the feedback is poor it's going to be personal in nature I.E not a team player if we're and furthermore even if it's not personal we can sort of make it personal so even if it's constructive this will trigger our emotions so emotions also trigger our home car or ego and what does that mean so remember that our ego is the part of our mind and that protects us from negative emotion so what it does is it like it starts to become egotistical we start to compare ourselves to other people it's essentially a protective mechanism but once again remember that once the ego activates it becomes part of our identity and the problem is that once it becomes a part of our identity this becomes unfixable because it's who okay right because who you are is not something you can change very easily it's not an action you can take so if we get this kind of feedback what I'd love to do is actually give you all sort of a an idea of like how to approach feedback that will give you some help in avoiding this whole cycle okay because once this also becomes who I am what that's going to do is even if we get constructive feedback we're going to ignore the constructive feedback and we're going to go straight to emotions so for example if I lack confidence in myself at work and my boss tells me that I did a bad job for reasons a b and c instead of recognizing that those are things that I can fix and then do a good job what I actually end up learning or the takeaway that I have is oh I'm so terrible at this job I'm never going to be good there's so many other people who are better than me and then what I end up is I end up setting up a self-fulfilling prophecy of failure because I'm not even able to incorporate good feedback because my Identity or my ego takes control of my mind so what should you do if you get bad feedback okay so the first thing you should do is anticipate your emotions so if you have a performance review coming up and you're afraid to talk to your boss you're afraid you're terrified to go in and get your your feedback right oh my God what if they tell me I do a bad job first of all if you're terrified that should tell you something about how you view feedback so anticipate what your emotions are so ask yourself okay what what do I you know what do I think I'm gonna feel how will I feel I'll feel anxious why do I think I'm going to feel anxious and then what we want to do is when you go into the feedback you want to listen so let's say you get the feedback and let's say that you get personal feedback so they say you're not a team player here so this is where I would encourage you to push back a little bit and then instead so you don't have to push back in kind of a mean way but what you can sort of do is you can ask your employer you can say Okay help me understand what that means so ask an open-ended question then what you can do is ask you know what can I do to be more of a team player you can ask something like what do team players do non-team players right so what you want to do is take whatever the defining term is and translate it into actual actions okay and then what we want to do is you can kind of say okay so I want to work on that so you want to sort of signal to your boss that you're interested in changing and then what you also want to do is is sort of start the measurement conversation and what is the measurement conversation that sort of asking okay so what are some examples like how am I how how do I know let's say a week from now whether I'm making progress right so what does progress look like does that mean mean attending meetings does that mean asking other people if they need help or offering to help people what is that you know what does that look like okay and you can even ask your boss explicitly how will we know or how do we measure progress just ask them so instead of getting oh you're not a team player you need to be more of a team player you can okay so like what what does a team player do that a non-team player doesn't do what do we you know what you could just ask questions like that and how are we going to measure what actual progress looks like okay now so this is kind of what to do but what we're also going to talk about in terms of feedback is what not to do or how to avoid doing the harmful things in feedback so we're going to give you all kind of a a couple of like cognitive exercises that you can go through to do to avoid kind of falling into the the Trap of like taking feedback personally so the first question you can ask yourself is what would I tell a friend of mine if they received this feedback and you're going to notice that there's a big difference between what you you tell yourself and what you tell a friend of yours so a good example of this is you can think about breakups right so if someone breaks up with a friend of yours and they say it's not you it's me how what would you tell your friend what do you think about them and what do they tell themselves what would you tell yourself there's going to be a big difference there okay next question that we need to ask is how did this feedback make me feel because oftentimes when we get feedback we just think about the feedback we think about changing it we think about fixing it we don't even think about the impact it had on us and that's huge because ultimately the instrument that we are going to use to fix the situation is us so if we become compromised in some way it'll sabotage our attempts to fix the feedback and this is why people get stuck getting the same damn feedback over and over and over again right people will tell you you need to study harder you need to apply yourself more and once again like how do you do that what is that who the [ __ ] knows the bigger problem problem though is you feel so bad after being told oh you would succeed if you just tried harder the negative emotional impact to you tanks your motivation and makes it impossible for you to try harder because the whole point is your feelings decrease your motivation and if your motivation is down how are you supposed to try harder so you have to understand how the feedback made you feel now here's the next step okay this is how we really start to fix it and you can't really do this next step until you've done these others which is what fears about myself become truer with this feedback this is the biggest thing that most people miss about feedback is that when we get feedback we each carry around some fears right I may not be capable I'm an imposter no one will ever love me I don't have what it takes and so when we get some feedback we've got this fear and the fear is sitting in the back of our mind and it's waiting for evidence because you're terrified right so let's understand this from a neuroscientific perspective for a second if I have a fear that is terrifying what does the brain want to do so we've evolved with our brains if we're afraid of a snake let's say we saw a snake an hour ago what are we going to do to any stimulus in the environment around us that even remotely looks like a snake it creates a cognitive filter that supports and reinforces the fear and that's a survival mechanism right so if I saw a snake in my house an hour ago and there's a piece of rope on the ground or there's an extension cord my mind is going to jump to the possibility that that is the snake and I'm gonna freak out so once we hold a particular fear we have this cognitive bias that we will interpret information to support that fear and this is why even constructive feedback we can sort of make it personal and it sabotages us instead of being a road map to actually improve our lives so you have to be aware of what fears about myself does this feedback concern uh confirm and literally like write it out right it may sound scary to like put it on paper but actually the whole reason that the fear grows so much is because we never face it we never acknowledge it it just lives in the back of our mind and continues to create cognitive filter after cognitive filter after cognitive filter so it shapes our thought process without us ever realizing it because it's too scary to admit it's what you've got to do is ask yourself what feedback what what fears about myself become truer with this feedback and now we're gonna go to a evidence-based approach to sort of fixing this problem okay so the next thing that we need to ask ourselves is what factors outside of my control led to the feedback and what factors in my control led to the feedback now this is a really important step because if we look at it what does our mind do automatically it just looks at this it completely ignores this part so all we ever think about is what I did wrong oh my God I'm such a terrible person I'm not charismatic that's that's why I'm not a team player you know I could like I and what we actually end up doing is if we think about let's say we made a mistake half of the mistake is ours to control half of the mistake is outside of our control right I know it sounds kind of weird but how can you say that because no no it's all my fault no I mean just think about that for a second any situation especially at work is not going to be 100 in your control it's absolutely ridiculous I suppose the only situation that I can kind of think of is if you're if you're the only person who works at your job you're your own boss and you control all of the market forces as well that's I suppose a situation but if you really think about it anything at work there's something there's some work contribution there's some non-work contribution but the whole point is that our mind jumps to this so we need to explicitly sort of think a little bit about what are the factors outside of our control and so then because normally what happens is until we acknowledge this we feel responsible for this whole thing we try to fix all of this and then what happens is this is frustrating because half of this is is impossible for us to fix but we are accepting responsibility for fixing it anyway and so this leads to inefficiency and frustration okay because we're not we're trying to fix things that are outside of our control which means that of the stuff that we can control we're at best putting forth 50 effort so once you go through this and you start to realize okay there's actually some stuff that is outside of our control so then what I'm going to do is I'm going to focus 100 on this quadrant and actually on purpose draw a line over here and not worry about any of this stuff and so this in turn will make us more efficient and less frustrated so next thing that we're going to do and we kind of talked about this a little bit already is what actions can I take and now we have to be a little bit careful here so this is you have to separate this out into two further questions what actions do I wish I could take and what I capable of reasonably so this is huge because oftentimes when we think about responding to feedback we just jump to everything we're like oh I just and we create this wish list that's based on this like idealized version of ourself if I was the person I knew I could be I would wake up at 6am every day I'd Network in the evenings I did this I did that I do this I don't know take a step back take a deep breath what actions can you actually take what's reasonable for someone who has accomplished what you've accomplished over the last month what is reasonable to do this week right so we got to take a step back and not let our emotions turn our actions into a wish list because the more ashamed that we feel about ourselves the more grandiose actions are going to be and thus we do more so elves to failure because we're setting ourselves up for tasks that we won't be able to accomplish okay next question you've got to ask yourself is how do I track Improvement so I this is a really important question because when I talk to people who are upset about where they are in life they'll say I'm such a loser and then I'll say okay so you want to work on that great how are you going to measure what percentage of progress you're making on being a loser how do you even measure that and so we set goals for ourselves that are completely unmeasurable and we don't want to be a loser anymore I want to be a winner okay cool I get that you want that that's a wish that you have but how do you actually measure it and then the next thing and this is the last thing which is oftentimes also very important which people don't really acknowledge especially when they're feeling ashamed about themselves and they're a home cars active is what is my contingency plan when things don't work okay and related to this who can I ask for help when things don't work because a lot of times when we get feedback we don't even think about enroll following anyone else we don't even acknowledge for a moment I know it sounds kind of weird but whose responsibility is it that you learn to do a good job at work and so we all may say oh it's my responsibility but the truth is that it's not just your responsibility it's also your boss's responsibility right they're the ones that are responsible for you and yet we have this this culture nowadays where bosses don't accept responsibility of like the work product of people beneath them and so it's kind of foreign like it like it's actually their partially their job I contribute something and they contribute something and when we receive feedback and we take it personally the thought of asking for help never even crosses our mind so let's say I set a target for myself one week from now then and there before I even get to that week I should develop a contingency plan okay who am I going to ask for help do I need to go see a therapist because I'm depressed do I need to get evaluated for a vitamin B deficiency do I need to spend some time with my friends spend some time with family am I going to sign up for a course am I going to learn how to meditate am I going to start exercising can I ask co-workers for help can I ask my boss for help and start to set your contingency plan in place and so I know it sounds kind of weird but what we actually want to do is like not take feedback personally and if you're given personal feedback even reject it because personal feedback is not actionable is not measurable is Holy within theoretically your control even though there's nothing you can really do about it right if someone tells you yeah you're just not a good fit or you're not a team player like what do you do about that there's nothing you can do about it and so as we sort of wallow in the shame of receiving personal feedback as we accept that for personal feedback without approaching it critically it worsens our sense of identity about ourselves creates more of a cognitive filter becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy right because we're not actually making changes we're just terrified that oh my God like I'm gonna screw up I'm gonna screw up I'm gonna screw up and then sort of creates this like reinforcing cycle so oddly enough what I'd encourage you all to do is reject feedback that is personal in nature because you can't do anything about that and you don't have to reject it in a harsh way right screw you I don't accept that but you can start to ask questions okay what can I do about this what actions would you recommend that I take how are we going to measure progress and even to start thinking a little bit about what amount of this feedback is outside of my control what amount of this feedback is in my control what actions can I take and as you start focusing on an action-oriented approach and there's research that shows that this is effective it actually changes your attitude attitude and mindset in the work related space instead of wallowing in shame and frustration because you're such a loser you start to actually make progress right and then you start to feel a little bit better about yourselves because actually your thoughts are focused on doing better and then once you set up a measurement scheme for yourself and you actually start to hit those targets that's going to actually boost self-esteem and then you'll realize something that I know is really bizarre but once we remove ego from the equation feedback is one of the best things that we can get because feedback is the way for us to get better at life get better at our job and who doesn't want to be better we all want to be better feedback actually moves us to one step closer to perfection towards the ideal version of yourself people are literally telling you what you're doing wrong so that you can fix it and once you fix it your life will be better you will be better your performance will be better but why do do we why are we so damn afraid of feedback because of the ego so as long as ego is a part of it it completely shifts the direction and impact of feedback and as we stop taking it personally as we stop accepting personal feedback and we start focusing on actions just about everything will start to get better
