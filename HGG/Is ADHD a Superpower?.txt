so why is it hard to do it's because i don't think for many people it clicks what the cost of sleeping poorly using drugs and eating unhealthily is so do you have moments of your true potential i can only explain it as a temporary and extremely inconsistent moment where i'm operating completely normal i can converse i have a high confidence i'm witty i can think sharply i'm complete at complete ease and everything seems effortless and easy it might happen one day every few weeks or even longer it's like the stars have aligned and everything is functioning as it should i see this state and it's both encouraging and extremely discouraging it's a tease it's like dangling a carrot in front of me this is what you could be like but unfortunately you'll be dysfunctional again tomorrow this is what makes the condition so tantalizing because i know what i'm capable of but i cannot sustain the state of mind for any amount of time and it's seemingly so completely random when it occurs then i'll be back in my brain fog stuttering unable to articulate my thoughts unable to be present lost in my head incapable of making decisions etc so this is the kind of thing where it's really unfortunate but sometimes we have moments of true potential right and it feels like we're we're trying to bottle lightning so it's like there's this flash and then suddenly everything works the way it's supposed to you're talking to people the ideas are going you're productive you're focused you're witty you're having a good time you're feeling good right it's not just about productivity it's also about mood the problem is that it's like completely rng and we have no idea like what causes this and this is actually what's so devastating about it is that we know i love the way that this person kind of described it we know it's possible all we have to do is like figure out how so this is the kind of thing where we can't even give up on it right we can't grieve it because it's not gone it's not like it's never happening again it's not like it happened just once it happens consistently randomly but consistently every few weeks you get one day where everything is amazing and so then your mind is like if only i could do this then my life could be like that like you know it could be so amazing and then what happens is you know it's like possible but you can't figure it out right and so then you get really really frustrated with yourself because you're like how do i do this how do i do this how do i do this if only i could do it why can't i be like this all the time these are the kinds of thoughts that your mind has and then you're stuck because like you have one of two options right either you struggle to try to figure this out and if you can imagine what your life would be like or you accept that this is not something that you can control and then all of these things that you know you're capable of you have to like let go sorry not going to be productive not going to be confident not going to be witty not going to be on point but you don't want to give that up because you know it's possible so it's super challenging so what's going on here and what can we do about it so the first thing that i want to ask y'all is like what do you think contributes to success actually let me rephrase what do you think contributes to successful performance so when people are are struggling in life what are the features that they sort of think about in terms of like whether they're successful or not okay so like i'm seeing a lot of stuff about you know diet and karma and focus and all this good stuff so generally speaking if we look at how human beings conceptualize success they think of two things they think of traits and they think of experience so we'll hear this a lot in our in our language right so people will say motivation discipline a person is motivated another person is lazy one person is disciplined another person is undisciplined these are all traits right so these are like even in the five factor personality model we'll have things like conscientiousness and so what this essentially means is that the future is kind of deterministic if you were born with the laziness gene you're screwed if you're born with the hard-working gene and the motivation gene you're in good shape i am confident or i am shy right these are traits so a trait is an inborn like kind of capacity that's like sort of like fixed the other thing that we assume is experience so we assume that people who do things more are going to be able to do them more and be able to be more successful so when i would do any kind of performance coaching work right so like i'll just use esports as an example but i do this for physicians as well attorneys investment bankers whatever so i'll ask people and you we can have this conversation with you too so when you play a video game the more you play a video game do you get better at it interesting question the automatic answer may be yes obviously but that may not be entirely true right so people are saying not always because like you can play a game for a thousand hours especially like pvp games and it's not like you're getting better every single minute right you can stick around you can plateau at a particular rank or mmr so the other thing that's kind of weird is in theory every game you play you have more experience you learn something from each game you play if you learn something from each game you play you should your chances of winning the next game should increase and when i talk to like pro esports players for example what i'll ask them is like what determines like whether you're gonna win a game or lose a game and so they'll say things like oh it's like my game knowledge how much i practice and stuff like that okay like okay fine so like but then if if if game knowledge determines whether you win a game or lose a game what that should mean is that my game knowledge is relatively fixed across 10 games right if i play like if i'm a pro my game knowledge is fixed across those 10 games which means that either my game knowledge is good enough and i should win all those 10 games or my game knowledge is bad and i should lose all those 10 games his game knowledge is relatively static over the course of a 10 game stretch if you're a professional player you can also think about this in medicine so if i'm a doctor like i've been practicing for 20 years and like over a 10-day stretch it's not like i forget a bunch of medicine and that's why like patients do poorly or i remember a bunch of medicine that's why patients do well so an experience so this is where what most people miss is that a lot of your success or a lot of your ability to motivate or have your mind do what you want it to is not based on trait or experience it's based on state so states are temporary right it's a state of mind a state of health a state of illness so having the flu having influenza as a state it's not a trait there's no influenza gene this is like a temporary state and in our society we have a very very big bias towards focusing on traits instead of states so basically when i work with someone what the what we focus on is who is the person who sits down at the computer to play the video game this is really simple how do you think a pro gamers performances if they haven't slept for 48 hours it's gonna suck right duh but wait a minute but like they've played 10 they've played 20 000 hours of the game before their game knowledge is still there that hasn't gone away it's not like they're live dementia they're not more lazy less lazy there's a lot of variability within our state and if you want to capture these kinds of moments and you have adhd the way to capture them is by focusing on state not trait because it's possible your brain is capable of it if your brain wasn't capable of it you would have never had had it happen so this sort of feels like the stars align now here's the cool thing if you pay attention you can figure out what the stars are and even how to arrange them and this is how you can get consistent performance is by focusing on state so what we're going to do is take a look at seven or eight factors that people tend to underemphasize when it comes to determining states okay so let's take a look at this so just a quick recap state versus straight so these are things like personality fixed deterministic why are you successful i'm motivated why are you lazy i mean why are you unsuccessful because i'm lazy these kinds of things even we can think about motivation as a state as well but oftentimes when you talk to people they'll use motivated as a is a trait this person is motivated right it's like oh like this person is must be so motivated another good one is smart talented right this is like fix like smart is fixed it's not something that changes on an hourly basis so states are variable alterable and sort of like not deterministic right so it sort of like kind of varies that's the key thing but they're both very very involved in terms of determining kind of what you accomplish so the flow state is a really good example of like states of mind where where we have productivity so examples of state are the flow state we also have in meditation diana right we have different states of consciousness we can also call this in the zone so we know that this is these are temporary the question is how do we cultivate them and answer there's a lot that we can do so the first thing that we can do to cultivate a particular state of mind is control our thoughts so we're going to go into more detail with some of these in less detail with others so we just talked a little bit about self-talk but you can actually change your self-talk and this you can change through emotional processing so i'll give you guys just a quick example so let's say i'm not motivated to date but it's really hard for me to go on a date and as i talk to someone so i've talked to patients for example i'd be like yeah it's really hard for me to go on and i'll talk to them why okay what happened well i had this this one relationship that lasted seven years and then the person kind of abandoned me and now like every time like and so i sort of feel they don't say it this way but they end up feeling unlovable they end up fearing that the same thing will happen to them again and so they don't want to invest any amount of time in dating they don't want to waste their time because they put seven years into this relationship they didn't get it back and so now they're like scared to date because i don't have another seven years to waste and if i don't have seven years to waste and that's the predominant mind uh thought in my mind when i go on a date it's gonna like what like what does that create right it creates all kinds of pressure on the other person it's a lack of confidence you're certainly not gonna have fun right because you're like thinking about i can't afford to waste any time i can't afford to waste any time and you're sitting there you're supposed to be trying to get to know someone like that's not fun at all so this can sort of be somewhat of a self-controlling self-fulfilling prophecy so you have to learn how to control your thoughts and a big part of that is going to be emotional processing also lots of detail into how to do that in dr k's guide to doing stuff second thing that we have to be really careful about is our internal emotional state sort of related to number one but what i mean by this is like processing past emotions okay so this is like past emotions and what we sort of know if you look at studies on people who have addictions what you discover is the part of their brain that is aware of their internal emotional state is not as robust as a healthy person so what does this mean if you ask people who relapsed how did you relapse everything was going great and then i don't know what happened they'll say things like i don't know what happened if you actually tunnel down what you tend to find is that there's some kind of subsurface powerful emotion that causes them to reach for the numbing agent they just weren't aware of it so you have to become aware of your internal emotional state how are you feeling in the moment next thing that we're going to talk a little bit about this is really interesting is we don't really think about the foods that we eat is psychoactive so we know that there are some things i can put into my body like caffeine let's say alcohol marijuana even things like um you know people will even try stuff like theanine ashwagandha there's all kinds of stuff that we can use kavakava these are all herbs and stuff that are psychoactive affect the state of our mind but we tend to think that these things affect our mind but we don't think about things like sandwiches or tomatoes or rice or fried chicken as psychoactive substances but it turns out that they are diet in the treatment of adhd in children a systematic review of the literature a total of 52 studies were identified some investigating whether adhd symptoms can improve by avoiding certain food elements 20 studies and whether some whether certain foods may reduce adhd symptoms elimination diets and fish oil supplementation seem to be promising dietary interventions for the reduction of adhd symptoms in children interesting huh so let's understand this for a second what determines your motivation like which organ of the body determines motivation and clarity of mind right chances are it's our brain i don't know if you guys know this but the brain is a physiologic organ that requires like physical substances so for example fish oil is high in omega-3 and omega-3 is very very important for neuronal health so there's a decent chance that if you have trouble getting into the right state of mind that your diet could be part of the problem which we don't tend to think about and this is why if you look at yogis so like yogis who want to meditate for 12 hours a day they're very controlling for their diet i've been on i mean not right now but in the past i've been on something called the satwik diet and being on a scottish diet for 90 days is when you truly understand that's when you begin to understand what meditation truly is i don't think you can even achieve some of these higher states of consciousness unless you're on a sativic diet and that's why all the yogis eat this way they're not eating that way for their figure and they're not eating their way out of financial reasons what they've actually done is looked at all of the subtle effects of food on the mind and there's like a pro like consciousness diet which they adopt satvik okay we're not going to go into that right now but there are all kinds of food so this is where like if you're struggling in terms of your motivation or this these clarity moments it's important what did you eat for the 24 to 72 hours before you had that moment because chances are there's something in your diet that helped a lot next thing that we don't really consider in terms of states is low-grade inflammation this is somewhat related to diet but we also know that for example like when people have gluten sensitivity it creates like a low-grade inflammation and then they have like trouble in their like because their your brain is like mildly inflamed so if you think about getting over a cold and how motivated and how energetic you are when you're like a little bit sick and some of our diet is actually filled with stuff that is kind of pro-inflammatory and as there's all kinds of things like leaky gut hypothesis and we sort of know that like low-grade inflammation is going to be bad for cognitive function right i want you all to think about this there are studies and these studies by the way i've looked at a lot of them in detail they're not very robust so the data behind diet and adhd is actually not that great by the way i mean there's like indications that it helps but i just don't think that it's specific enough but this is the kind of thing we're like what's the inflammatory state of your body are you eating pro-inflammatory foods are you getting like this is why like if we look at scientific studies on health like what does it take you know fruits and vegetables and how much of this are you eating and if you're not eating enough of it chances are what you're going to do is you're going to get constipated and as you get constipated i don't know if you'll know this but you start to get rotting material stuck in your intestines and then this stuff causes inflammation how do you feel after you have a good poop right kind of weird we don't really think about it very much so if you're like wondering how to bottle this lightning of these pro adhd like these like high productivity states it involves touching on all of these things next thing that we don't really think about is rest quality so how are you sleeping and this is where we don't really think about a couple things so good example of this so alcohol and marijuana both reduce your rem sleep so this is the tricky thing about alcohol and to a lesser extent marijuana we i know the science behind alcohol a little bit better alcohol helps people fall asleep but lowers the quality of their sleep so if you drink on a regular basis or you smoke on a regular basis chances are the quality of sleep that you're getting overnight is like not good or it's worse so rem sleep generally composes of 18 to 23 of a night's sleep the other thing about rem sleep is we're not really sure what it does we don't really know is even despite all of our advances it appears to be important but we're not quite sure how or why and we know that alcohol reduces your rem sleep so you may still sleep for eight or nine hours if you get drunk and you pass out you're certainly it's very easy to fall asleep but then the quality of your sleep sucks so whatever your brain is trying to accomplish during sleep where it goes through these different stages and rem sleep and stuff like that you're sabotaging it by using these kinds of things so if your rest quality is not good your ability to foster cultivate that magical state of productivity is going to be hampered last thing that we're going to talk about is environment so this too we've got a lot we're going to cover it now but there's a lot more detail about how to structure your environment in our upcoming guide on dr k's guide to adhd and doing stuff but let's go through a couple of basics okay so if you all want like worksheets and like implementation plans and stuff like that that's all in the guide but we're going to cover the basics right here now so the first thing to understand is that there are things called permissive influences so what's an example of a permissive influence a permissive influence is something that allows something else to happen so for example in the female menstrual cycle we have estrogen and progesterone so when my body secretes estrogen or when my ovaries secrete estrogen it creates progesterone receptors so estrogen goes in and creates a progesterone receptor like this and now when i have progesterone which is a little cube it has something to go and activate oh you guys can't see this okay so this is where like progesterone doesn't work without estrogen and so this is where even if you look at things like birth control for women it involves messing with the balance of these hormones so that you essentially don't allow for a pro-gestational i.e pro-pregnancy state so what does this have to do with like cultivating these moments in adhd what are the permissive influences for those moments when you hang out with a particular group of friends do they make you more interested in working or less interested in working and this is where there's permissive influences for procrastination as well there are permissive influences for bad states of mind sometimes y'all may have had a on-again off-again relationship with someone who's toxic that you just can't get away from when they enter your life boy is it a blast but boy does everything else in your life start to go to hell so you can have people who are permissive influences for things like procrastination and toxicity and you can have permissive influences for things like focus ambition and positivity so do you go to professional networking events do you go to startup meets i remember back when i was in boston there was this cool thing called venture cafe which was just an event a networking event every week where there's like someone who comes and talks about startups and you just go and you learn what people are doing in the cambridge area which is like near where mit is and stuff like that harvard and mit are there so like you just go and like every week you like if you just go and just talk to people and you just like it gets you thinking gets the juices flowing right so for those of you that noticed or touched a touch of grass initiative so we've like got that going on this is a great way to get out of your house because if you're stuck within these four walls what kinds of thoughts do these four walls encourage when you're in these four walls what do you feel like doing what do you end up doing what do you end up thinking about so if you want to capture these motivational moments of brilliance what you've got to do is recognize first of all that it's not about traits it's not about discipline it's not about intelligence it's not about talent it's about states it's recognizing that this brain in order to create a certain state of focus mental focus is born of the mind and the mind is seated within the brain and we know this because if you eat particular foods or ingest particular substances like alcohol it alters the function of your mind what organ system is alcohol focus acting on it's focusing on the brain so as we alter the physicality of our brain we will create particular mental states so this is where a lot of that state work is is done through things like diet sleep exercise vitamin d all that kind of stuff and there's more to it than that there's cultivating the right kinds of thoughts you can certainly meditate there's also cultivating the right kind of environment so if you're trying to capture those moments it's not so much that you should not look at what to do what you should do is like look at that moment and try to look at the days before the weeks before what was your emotional state were you stressed out about something were you feeling really good about stuff like what hap what led up to that what was going on within your body within your gut within your brain and within your mind that fostered and allowed this fertile soil for the state of consciousness to arise and as you get into that then you will be able to actually cultivate these states consistently this is the wild thing you can absolutely do this and for those of you that are saying oh i just need to like sleep well and eat healthy right that sounds hard so why is it hard to do it's because i don't think for many people it clicks what the cost of sleeping poorly using drugs and eating unhealthily is they don't realize that the cost is losing out on these moments of brilliance what you're costing yourself is going into super saiyan mode right we just don't appreciate the cost because it never clicks with us that these two things are related and as we start to work on these influences you will find that this effort over time it takes time you're going to plant a seed you're going to plant another seed plant another seed it'll turn into a shrub and then eventually it'll have flowers and then eventually it'll bear fruit and once you sort of figure out what your internal formula is in terms of like productivity and focus like it'll transform your life questions this is a good question what if sleep deprivation cause makes you disinhibited enough to reach that state isn't it a slippery slope great question someone else is asking sometimes i perform better when i'm fatigued so there's one really important exception to being well rested so when you're fatigued your mind is a little bit exhausted and your thoughts move slower when your thoughts move slower if what is destroying your focus is a hyperactive mind then you will be more focused so if i if there's a good level of focus this focus can be destroyed either by having a hyperactive mind or a hypoactive mind so for example if i feel overwhelmed and i can't focus because i have a thousand different things going on and my mind is all over the place that's a hyperactive mind so focus can be shattered by a hyperactive mind and sometimes fatigue can be an antidote to that right because then like your mind is like operating at 80 and so 80 of all of your stress actually puts you in a good good space because you're normally like your mind is operating at like 120 so you need some kind of fatigue to kind of calm you down and chill you out this is also why some people will reach for substances to calm themselves down to treat their anxiety right i use marijuana for my anxiety for example because it slows their mind down so the goal is slowing your mind down now you can do that through a substance you can do it through a medication sometimes you can do it through fatigue or you can do it through healthier methods than all of those which is like training your mind to slow down processing thoughts learning how to compartmentalize thoughts learning how to set things down in your mind there are all kinds of different things you can do you can also train your your thoughts through your breathing so the speed of your thoughts correlates with the speed of your exhalation specifically so this is why for example when people are hyperventilating in a panic attack we'll ask you to breathe in a paper bag why do we ask you to breathe in a paper bag we don't really do that as much anymore but that's because like as you breathe in a paper bag the co2 level within the bag starts to sort of increase so you have to take slower deeper breaths so what happens is we have this thing called physiologic dead space so i don't know if this sort of makes sense but even when i fully exhale my lungs are not completely empty right it's not like completely empty there's air stuck in there that keeps my lungs open then what happens is the air down here let's say like if i have air down here in my lungs like along the bottom all the oxygen has been removed from the that air then when i exhale this air goes out and ends up in my throat because even at the end of my exhalation there's actually air in my throat and then when i breathe in again this air is the first air that goes down into my lungs so we have this thing called physiologic dead space which is space where there's air that has no oxygen so if i'm taking shallow breaths the dead air is moving here here here here here and i only get fresh air in this part whereas if i take a deep breath the dead air goes down here the air with that oxygen goes down here and then i get all this with fresh air if that sort of makes sense so we want to encourage hypoventilation to calm down anxiety it's physiologic yogi's figured this out as well it's part of the reason that a lot of these breathing practices involve slowing the breath and thus controlling the mind so the key thing here is that your mind can be controlled you can foster a particular state of mind that's incredibly productive you just have to know how to do it and this is the cool thing is that all of these decisions are not don't require like willpower right it's not forcing yourself into the state of mind it's actually decisions that you make the day before in the day before in the day before it's going to bed a little bit earlier waking up a little bit later potentially it's about processing your emotions a little bit better it's about having let's say an apple before you have your pepperoni pizza as opposed to just having pepperoni pizza all of these things will will matter right so giving up pepperoni pizza is like hard from a willpower standpoint but if you're starving like kind of nudging yourself towards eating an apple before you dive into the pizza is way easier pizza's right there i'm going to take two slices instead of three i'm just gonna have an apple first as you start to cultivate these sorts of changes your mind will improve and when your mind improves you'll find yourself in these states more often so someone's asking does this mean i should go for a crazy run in the morning to control adhd a bit that's where i would say you should try it and see what happens right you should try it so that's where like you're gonna figure out this is where the right answer is not something that i'm gonna tell you because i don't know what your body is precisely i don't know what your brain is precisely i don't know what your mind is precisely these are the major factors that people tend to miss thank you very much for the donations by the way okay so i see other questions what if your mind is hypoactive so that's where so our mind becomes sort of hypoactive especially through technology use it becomes kind of dulled right where then what happens is we need the technology to like artificially ramp it up so an engaging tick tock or an adrenaline inducing video game takes a baseline hypoactive mind and amplifies it to a normal level which is why it's so damn addictive and then once we stop playing the game we go back to the hypoactive mind right and we don't like being in that state so we need the adrenaline to like build up and the other problem is that as we get more and more adrenaline through the game we actually down regulate some of our receptors in our brain not really adrenaline receptors this is sort of a extrapolation here then what happens is we sort of become dependent on it almost like caffeine so if your mind is hypoactive that's where we look at some of these permissive influences like what are you eating who are you spending time with who are the people that stimulate your thoughts in the right direction thank you for the donation nicholas so g dom 2000 is saying i can confirm that exercise and diet helped my with my adhd the worse i eat the worse my symptoms tend to get right and then if you go into ayurveda so we don't really have great scientific evidence for this but if you go into ayurveda they even say there are particular foods that fruits and vegetables are not all the same that particular fruits and particular vegetables will be good at cultivating particular mental states now we have some evidence of this sort of right so ayurveda goes as far as saying particular foods are good for particular mental states but they start by saying that that presumes that all of the foods are unique and generally speaking in western medicine for a long time we've said five servings of fruits or vegetables doesn't really matter what you eat whereas now we know that there are some things like cruciferous vegetables that have particular effects on your cytochrome p450 enzymes we know that grapefruit can do that as well and we'll actually like cause particular alterations so we now are starting to see that there's a lot more specificity to fruit and vegetable than we originally realized even if you look at some of these things like the fodmap diets these are good examples of like how particular food not all fruits and vegetables are made the same and there's an intersectional component between foods that we eat as well as someone's individual digestion these are concepts that ar veda has been hypothesizing or proposing for thousands of years okay so fractal loop as a great question i've heard probiotics have positive effects on mental health due to gut health what do you think so very good question we go into a lot of detail in this and dr k's guide so you all can watch it there's a lot more detail but we'll answer it here so gut bacteria has definitely a strong impact on your mental health so we know this because we know this from a lot of different ways so we know that gut bacteria can sometimes cause inflammation or re or be healthy and have less inflammation so inflammation in the gut leads to inflammation in the brain inflammation in the brain tends to negatively impact things like mood this we know second thing that we know certain kinds of gut bacteria are more symbiotic than others so some get gut bacteria will make neurotransmitter precursors so they'll produce tryptophan so here's the relationship you have with your gut bacteria you give it food it gives you it breaks down the food keeps some for itself and gives you what's left over and your brain takes tryptophan which is made by some gut bacteria and turns it into serotonin which by the way is what we supplement when people are depressed or have anxiety disorders okay so we know that gut creates neurotransmitter precursors next thing that we know so those are like basic science kind of things the question though is that do those actually lead to clinical benefits sure it causes inflammation we can measure that sure they create neurotransmitters but does it actually make a difference clinically the answer is yes we've done studies on stool transplants which is exactly what it sounds like they will take stool from one person or rat and implant it into another person or rat and they will see improvement in conditions like major depressive disorder so it appear and stool by the way is 50 bacteria okay so we've tested it seems to work take the poop from a depressed rat stick it into oh sorry take the poop from a healthy rat stick it into a depressed rat and the depressed rat gets better we also know that there are particular strains of bacteria that are more common in people who have bad anxiety there are two strains of bacteria that are tightly associated with bad anxiety and there are two strains of bacteria that appear to be anti-anxiety or if you look what we mean by that is if you look at people who have low anxiety scores and you check their gut there are two bacteria that they have that people have high anxiety don't have in fact people have high anxiety have these two different kinds of bacteria there seems to be a lot of connections between gut bacteria and mental health the question though was probiotics and mental health now this is where the marketing gets tricky so if you take a probiotic how long are you supposed to take it people usually say take it every day why do you have to take probiotics every day they're they have cfus colony forming units they're living bacteria why do you have to take product probiotics all day long that's because probiotics may not affect it and the reason is because which bacteria grow in your gut the ones that you feed so this is where like you know the health industry would love to say hey look at all this research on mental health and gut bacteria take this pill every day by the way you need to take it every day in order to get this beneficial bacteria but what determines your gut bacteria is not whether you take a probiotic every day it's what you feed your bacteria so if i eat a lot of like processed foods with simple sugars they're going to be some bacteria in my gut that digest those preferentially right so i'm going to be feeding the bacteria that like processed foods and simple sugars whereas if i eat like oatmeal and broccoli all the time i'm going to be feeding the bacteria that break down complex fibers and like call cellulose and some of these other things that we can't digest so the key thing about maintaining proper gut bacteria is not taking probiotics every day it's eating the right foods so if i take probiotics and then i feed i can take i can add 50 000 units of whatever kind of bacteria you want in a call in a probiotic pill but 50 000 units is nothing we have 10 times as many bacterial cells in our body as we have human cells for every one cell inside this that is human there are 10 cells that are bacterial so fifty thousand hundred thousand three hundred thousand cfus of like probiotics is like nothing compared to what you've got in there so this is where what i tend to find is that you can take probiotics but you've got to eat the right foods too and what we love to do in current developed society we love to take pills that absolve us of behaviors i don't want to eat broccoli just give me the freaking probiotic pill and there is a whole supplement industry that loves that so what is the role of probiotics on mental health short answer is we don't know right we i don't at least i haven't seen overwhelming or convincing evidence that probiotics consistently help there's some evidence that they help because you do need to populate with the right bacteria the key thing that people miss is that once you populate with the right bacteria you need to support those bacteria with the right foods and as you support those bacteria with the right foods then you'll start to see positive effects which is exactly how we get to this paper right so if we go back to this one elimination diets and fish oil supplementation seem to improve symptoms of adhd so why is the elimination diet important probably from the inflammatory standpoint okay so people are asking what foods promote tryptophan and serotonergic precursors so this is where our science falls short so it's my belief that the ayurvedic diet the mechanism of action of ayurvedic diets is through gut bacteria that's my belief we actually don't have a whole lot of strong science to support that and our western conception of diet is still i think like very primitive so we still think predominantly in macronutrients we need 50 grams of protein but as one gram of protein the same as another gram protein if i get a gram of protein from a lentil is that the same as a chicken breast if the chicken breast is organic and free range does that matter so we tend to think about macro nutrients we tend to split things up and we're like grams of fiber is what's important which is true but we don't really have good evidence on this this is something that i will say is that when i work with patients right so i don't have data to support this but anecdotally patients who adopt better diets can come off of medication easier i've seen that very consistently in my practice now what's going on there is it the gut bacteria who knows is just eating healthy who knows it could be correlational as well that people who are healthier can eat healthier right because it's like harder to make yourself salad than it is to like microwave something from the freezer so maybe there could be a correlational thing where it's not really causation it could be correlation yeah so i think we have we've published some of this stuff so i definitely know there's there's guide supplements i mean uh dietary supplements with dr k's guide i imagine that some of those are floating around on the internet but um and you know a lot of different people will talk about ayurvedic diet
