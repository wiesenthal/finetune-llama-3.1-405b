and all the negativity that i experience in dreams is like feels 100 real like i'm so terrified i'll wake up in a cold sweat and just terrified terrified terrified girlfriend keeps giving me crap for cheating on her in her dreams my girlfriend has been dreaming a lot about me cheating on her or treating her badly in her dreams this has happened around seven times already and i keep on waking up to her angry messages about how i treat her in her dreams i always apologized for it even though i did nothing wrong and have made sure to assure her that i would never do those things in real life but today was the last straw i woke up to her being very pissed at me and i decided that i would not apologize this time because it's honestly not my fault um and i've done all i can to assure her now she wants to break up because i was being too aggressive towards her and her insecurities so this sounds kind of frustrating so this is where you know we can go a couple different routes so let's kind of start with the relationship route you know if you're having an argument with someone who has a belief that you think is unreasonable like you cheated on me in my dreams therefore you need to apologize i think a good way to have that conversation is to ask open-ended questions about help me understand what i need to apologize for well you cheated on me in my dream you'd ask questions like am i responsible for the behavior that you're that your mind is that me like is that actually mean like can i control what i do in your dreams you just ask simple questions like that like you know i really start with just open-ended questions like help me understand what what i did that was wrong you know and that's where sometimes you can you know sort of disagree that like i i don't know how to control my behavior in your dreams like i don't know how to do that right and this is the kind of thing where you've got to be careful because when you first started apologizing for it you sort of took responsibility for it right does that make sense it's kind of weird but like when you say like oh yeah i'm sorry for things that are outside of my control you set up a expectation for the future so this is where we've got to be really careful in relationships about what kinds of behaviors we reinforce because if you apologize for it five times then it's sort of like understandable why someone may get upset because you've set an expectation both of you all have agreed that this is your fault and you've said okay a few times right so there's like that whole angle of the relationship stuff but what i really want to focus on today is the dreaming part right so then like this sort of question of like why does the girlfriend keep dreaming about this person cheating on them and so like what's going on with dreams like what do we know about dreams so i'd love to talk to you all today a little bit about dreams and what we know about dreams and also what we don't know about dreams so we're going to do today is talk a little bit about i'm just going to share my experience in learning about dreams and sort of different perspectives that i have we're going to touch a little bit on sort of like hard science we're going to touch a little bit more on like soft science and different theories we're going to touch a little bit on psychotherapy and a little bit on spirituality so the first thing to understand about dreams we're going to start with science the first thing to understand about dreams is that we don't really know what they are and we don't really have great ways of studying them so what do what do i mean by that so if we think about neuroscience a lot of what we know about neuroscience is originally developed through animal models okay so what we'll sort of do is we want to figure out like how a neuron works for example the earliest studies on neurons used i believe squid neurons so squid neurons are like super super long and so they're quite large as well so like we will study like the brain through animals right so if we want to understand how the occipital lobe how the eyes work how the visual cortex works we'll sort of like study animals because in the case of an animal you can actually like dissect the animal you can look at the brain you can do kinds of invasive research on animals that we can learn things about scientifically the challenge with dreams is that we don't have a clear way of like inferring what the animal animals dreams are right so we can't we can sort of measure visual stimuli in animals we can measure things like you know fear responses we can measure rudimentary functions of the brain but when it comes to something as nuanced as a dream we can't really ask animals like what they're dreaming about so that's like there's kind of a disconnect there because some of the major tools that we use to learn about stuff neuroscientifically we can't really use animals very well to study dreams so what we're left with is humans and the problem with humans is we can ask them okay what did you dream about so we can actually get that kind of data we can get the subjective data from humans the problem is that we can't get the objective data from humans so studies like fmri which study blood flow to different parts of the brain eeg electroencephalogram which study electrical activity across the brain these tend to be imprecise neuroscientific tools so we can't open up someone's brain and sort of like operate on that minute level right where we can sort of do that with animals so the first thing to understand about research into dreams is that we're sort of fundamentally handicapped in a way that we're not with many other parts of studying the brain or other phenomenon that are neurological in nature that being said we can do some kinds of research and so we'll share with you kind of what we know about dreams the first thing is that no one has been able to figure out why we dream from a scientific basis so we don't really know exactly what purpose they serve there are case reports of people for example who have injuries who stop being able to dream and they seem to be doing okay for the most part um once again they had brain damage so it's hard to tell exactly what's caused by what but no one really knows exactly why we dream second thing that we sort of know is this is really interesting is that you dream in your dreams are based in your experiences in real life in some way so for example if you take a blind person when they dream they're not able to see so their dreams they can still dream but their dreams are composed of smells touches tastes sounds so if you lack a particular sense and your brain has never sort of experienced a particular sense you can't dream in that sense it's kind of interesting right next thing that we know about dream is that the most common subjective experience in dreams is that most streams tend to be filled with some kind of emotional content so the most common emotion that people experience in dreams is anxiety negative emotions tend to be more common than positive emotions but people can feel a full range of emotions and then we also know from like phenomenal logic studies that dreams tend to be kind of bizarre and exaggerated so they tend to be like pieces of reality that gets stitched together in nonsensical ways and amplified so it's like you know i'm at the circus and the president of the united states is there and the president transformed into an airplane and then everyone in the circus got performed a big tall tower of people and we stood on top of the airplane and the airplane flew into the ocean like that's like it's like nonsensical it's all pieces of something that could be plausible that are kind of stitched together but there does appear to be kind of emotional content which is very central to dreams a couple of other things which people tend to wonder about so about eight to ten percent of dreams tend to have sexual content so most dreams are not sexual in nature sometimes you can get you know vivid sexual experiences within dreams that tends to happen more rarely but it's not like dreams are all sexual in nature so we have some data on that kind of stuff the short answer is we don't really know you know what dreams are we know that they tend to be filled with emotional content we know that they tend to be restricted to senses which are capable of experiencing and they tend to get stitched together in different ways so the next thing that people are kind of curious about is like do dreams mean something okay i don't know if that makes sense but these are like basically like if so if i have a dream does it mean something right is this my brain trying to tell me that something is going on so let's kind of take a look at that for a second so there are a couple of different theories and what i'm going to do is kind of run through them so the first is that dreams and then we'll get to like freud and all that good stuff which i'm sure you guys are curious about oh there okay so the first so let's think through the possibilities the first is that dreams are rng okay so there's no meaning to anything in the dream it's just kind of random so one way to kind of think about this is you know they're different forms of divination like looking at chicken entrails or like reading tea leaves and things like that and if you kind of like look at the tea leaves at the bottom of your cup it can look like something right it can look like a dog or it can look like a wolf or it can look like a butterfly or whatever the human mind it's just a random assortment of stuff and it doesn't actually have some kind of meaning and the meaning that we see in dreams is assigned by our mind as opposed to having some kind of intrinsic meaning so in this kind of hypothesis what we sort of say is that okay your brain just does different kind of stuff cleans out adenosine remakes atp you know neurons kind of like go through some kind of maintenance process and as a side effect of maintenance we get these kinds of different you know stimuli and that's what a dream is and it has no significance whatsoever so second option is that they do have some kind of meaning so this is where people like freud come in so what freud basically said is he's like we've got this subconscious mind right that was freud's biggest contribution and i know that freud tends to get you know people talk about things like his stages of development like oral phase anal phase phallic phase all this kind of stuff edible complex like all his sexual stuff tends to get memed on the most but the biggest contribution he made to western psychology was he was basically the the first person in the west who was like hey we our mind is not all conscious there's this thing called the subconscious mind and the thing is that belief has become so prevalent in our society that we sort of take it as granted we don't even credit it to freud anymore people are just like oh it's the subconscious so what freud sort of said is we have the conscious mind but then we also have we have the subconscious mind we have the conscious mind and basically what happens is the conscious mind suppresses the subconscious mind so anna freud later explored this concept as defense mechanisms right so these kinds of things like denial intellectualization we have all these defense mechanisms where there's this stuff floating around in our subconscious that our conscious keeps in check and so the key thing about the dream is that during the i mean during sleep the conscious mind becomes inactive and therefore none of the defense mechanisms are active so what dreams actually are are subconscious it's like unfiltered subconscious thought so it absolutely has meaning okay it's basically our subconscious without the restraints of our conscious mind subconscious gone wild and then jung's also sort of agreed with this so yoon kind of said like yeah it's like the subconscious but then there were a couple of different important distinctions one is that freud thought that our subconscious thoughts are symbolic so what this sort of means and other people will sort of say that they're thematic so what's the difference between these so a symbolic representation is something that means something else whereas a thematic representation is it's not like precisely correct but the theme is actually the same it's more direct so even if in a dream i'm afraid of being you know hunted down by a bear what freud may say is that a bear is a symbol for my father whereas what i may be afraid a thematic person may say that i'm fear i'm afraid of being prey but it's not like the bear is a symbol for something it's the fear that's important like i'm afraid that someone is going to take advantage of me versus freud will say like oh like the bear means something else does that make sense so a good example of this is like you know so some people will say that losing your teeth in a dream is a symbol for a fear of death so losing teeth equals fear of death so they're symbolic representations whereas in a thematic representation losing teeth may be like oh crap i forgot to floss and i'm worried about dental hygiene so it's not really a one-to-one representation like the real world but it's basically like in the same ballpark whereas in the symbolic representation of dreams there's sort of like this idea that it actually means something else now i tend to be more of the mind of the thematic representation i don't really consider um you know there's some value to this sort of symbolic representation stuff but there are a couple of like problems with the symbolic representations one is as some critics have kind of pointed out like symbols are not the same for all people so some people will believe that symbolism is like universally human so there's some symbols that are universally human i don't know for example that like someone who grows up in papua new guinea that losing teeth has the fear of death right i i don't know that that's the case i just haven't seen evidence that has made me convinced that symbolic representations are universally human which then sort of begs the question okay so like if they're not universally human then what even if individuals can have symbolic representations you can't read a book about symbols and then have this mean the same thing for every person so then like understanding the objective nature of symbols within dreams i don't think really translates so much personally some people do believe that so they believe that i can read a book about symbolic representations and this is what this means for all human beings that all human beings think that losing teeth is a fear of mortality and they believe that and that's fine like they're allowed to do that right so this is kind of where um you know second kind of perspective is that it's actually subconscious thought um and then the third thing to kind of consider is that there's some amount of housekeeping so that dreams serve the function of basically some kind of like mental housekeeping so if there are you know fears or thoughts that i didn't take care of while conscious that i can take care of these in the dream sometimes there are different kinds of like so we know that like memory consolidation happens while we sleep and so the process of consolidating our memories may result in some kind of dream like stimulus right so if i spent the day at the theme park and was riding uh you know if i was riding roller coasters and i had a really great day and i enjoyed it a lot and like my brain at night is like okay let's like save that to long-term storage and in the process of saving that to long-term storage as i'm like you know rewriting that kind of stuff like i experienced some kind of rollercoaster-ish sort of dream where it's some sort of like reinterpretation of that stimuli so as part of kind of the natural process of what we do when we sleep like how our mind handles thoughts emotions experiences some of that process involves or manifests as dreaming so whether it's memory consolidation or you know experiences throughout the day that weren't processed appropriately they sort of get their time to kind of go on in our head now you may say like does that mean it's part of the subconscious mind there's some overlap here there's it's not necessarily like these are all exclusive but i think the big difference is that you know this is a kind of a short term thing where it's like if i did something on day one i will dream about it on night one or maybe night two whereas if you look at freud and and jung and stuff they sort of think that okay we've got this subconscious which maybe changes over time but is generally static and on you know night 263 we can have a dream about this on night 864. we can have a dream about this on night 22 we can have a dream about this does that kind of make sense i guess you all can't see that but so that's that's like uh kind of how those are different right so this is sort of like a daily housekeeping sort of thing okay so these are a couple of perspectives about what dreams are next thing to consider is kind of like spiritual perspectives actually let's talk about psychotherapy for a second so when it comes to dreams oftentimes we'll use these as tools in psychotherapy so in some disciplines of psychotherapy dreams are way more important than others so number one is psychoanalysis so psychoanalysis you can easily argue is is actually a precursor to psychotherapy and doesn't fall under the umbrella of psychotherapy you can say that it's it's actually completely different and that psychotherapy is an offshoot of psychoanalysis fair enough to say but in psychoanalysis so people like freud and jung so people who become freudian psychoanalysts and jungian psychoanalysts will do a lot of work around dreams okay so that's very common at the same time we don't really have great evidence that this is particularly useful i'm not saying that it isn't useful i'm just saying we don't have great studies on it we may have some studies on it but hey hi what's up nope i'm gonna finish my lecture even if it seems dry no i'm finishing my lecture on psychoanalysis of dreams okay if it's boring too bad we're almost done no we're talking about dreams today it look if you guys want to know about dreams we're going to learn about dreams and it doesn't i don't know like this is you know it is what it is okay so i guess she's bored with it um so in psychoanalysis people will do all these like complex dream interpretations stuff like that freud wrote a book called the interpretation of dreams um the interesting thing is that the more that we kind of evolve psychotherapy like the less symbolic and weird stuff kind of gets so there's even like cbt versions um of dream interpretation and i think this is where the kind of stuff that like i like about dreams so when i talk about dreams and psychotherapy what i tend to focus on is if someone has a dream so here's how i deal with dreams okay so let's say you've got a dream so the first thing that i'll do is i'll ask someone okay so like tell me about the dream and so they'll say okay this happened first this happened first this happened first this happened first this happened first this happened first all right sorry next next next okay so there's like six events that happen in the dream that they can remember and then like so what an analysts may do is they may look at this and they'll say like okay so and i'm probably not doing this justice if you're an analyst out there and you can explain this better please post it on our subreddit we'd really appreciate that but they'll say oh this means like fear of death you know this by the way is like this kind of internal conflict and they'll kind of translate your dream for you i personally don't put much stock in that and what i tend to ask people is for each of these events what was the emotion that you felt what was the emotion what was the emotion what was the emotion so as we go through the emotions then i'll basically ask them like is this relevant to real life in some way is this relevant to real life in some way is this relevant to real life in some way basically this is what i'll do and i'll try to see like if i've done psychotherapy with them i may know stuff about them right so i'll know like oh like you know i know that you've had a lot of conflict with your brother over this particular thing wow that seems like it's a very similar emotion to like what you were experiencing then right and we what we basically do is is i think about dreams as almost a projective test so this is like an inkblot test where we can it's really in the interpretation of it that you do with a patient that you really figure out like what has value and what doesn't because i do think i i personally think that dreams are not completely random so i don't i don't really subscribe to this i don't think that generally speaking if you look at the body our body doesn't do anything randomly so i find it hard to believe that there's just one part of our body that functions completely randomly whereas the rest of our body like everything that happens it happens for a reason so there's all kinds of fascinating stuff in the body like for example our muscles the muscles in our leg when they contract they actually push blood in our veins back up to our heart right so if you kind of think about how does so arteries have a lot of you know um elasticity to them veins have less elasticity to them our legs are beneath our heart i know this is kind of a random non-sequitur but it's like super cool in physiology so like if we kind of think about it how do we like pump blood from the bottom of our feet back up to our heart right because it's easy to get blood from our brain to our heart because it just has to go with gravity easy to get blood from our arms to our heart because that also sort of has to go with gravity easier to get blood from our stomach to our heart because it doesn't have to travel very far but when you're talking about the blood in your fingers and you're talking about the blood in your toes that has to go against gravity across a much longer distance and so our body was like oh i have a neat idea every time we contract muscles what we're going to actually do is squeeze the veins and push the blood back to the heart right so our body basically does everything for a reason you know and so i don't think that dreams are just completely random i think there's something going on in our mind and so when i do kind of dream work with patients we'll we'll sort of use it this way we'll sort of say like okay like what about the dream resonates with you what do you think in this dream is actually applicable to your real life and there is evidence that shows that people who do kind of dream work in psychotherapy so there's actually really interesting studies about people who are stuck in psychotherapy so if you feel stuck in psychotherapy oftentimes one way to kind of like randomly like get some sort of emotional grip and have some kind of like thing to work on or make some kind of breakthrough can often be done through dreams because it's kind of random right so you're trying to figure out okay what's going on here what's going on here you hit a dead end you hit a dead end then you start doing some dream work and it can really help in terms of like opening things up for people so i tend to think about dreams almost as projective tests where it's sort of like it gives us material to go through in a psychotherapeutic session okay so that's kind of like dreams and psychotherapy there's a lot that's written about this kind of stuff um i found a really good summary actually um let me see if i can just post this for y'all i found a 30 page oh yeah so this is just uh i just googled this and there's uh i can't post in chat but maybe you guys can the use of dreams in modern psychotherapy this is a great 30 page summary i it's in the public domain um uh not the published version this is the author's final peer-reviewed manuscript i think it's in the public domain i just googled it um oh it looks like okay that's interesting so i just googled psychotherapy and dreams and this came up i assumed it was in yeah it looks like it's just posted on marquette.edu um so it looks like it's posted for public consumption so it's just a great so this is if y'all are interested in this i would highly recommend this because it's 36 pages so it's not like a textbook or something but she does a really good job of going through like a lot of the common um sort of like summarizes like what adler said about dreams what ewing said about dreams in one paragraph and so it's it's really good it's an introductory uh thing about like you know dreams and psychotherapy it's actually excellent um probably the best thing i've read to be honest and i've tried to study this stuff a lot it's just a lot of it is very like obtuse and dense so that's uh so dreams dream analysis can be useful in psychotherapy some psychotherapists will work a lot with dreams and other psychotherapists will won't work so much i think what we've tended to see is over time people have moved away from this especially with the advent of the third wave of psychotherapies like dialectical behavioral therapy and all this mindfulness oriented stuff um so yeah it's it's useful in psychotherapy how useful depends on the therapist and depends on your interest as well last thing that we're going to talk about is spiritual perspectives so these i'm gonna focus on eastern perspectives i don't feel qualified it's not like i'm you know i'm just not knowledgeable enough on like baha'i islamic perspectives on dreams i have not studied those in any formal or informal way so i'm sure that in the judeo-christian system and and you know all these like i don't know what shinto people believe about dreams i just don't know i haven't studied it so i'm going to focus on the karmic religions eastern religions like buddhism hinduism and a couple of different interpretations there the first thing is that in the yogic system it's not so much the content of the dream that's important but an understanding that a dream is a state of consciousness so a lot of the eastern perspective is really interested in in dreams in terms of like it's a fundamentally different state of consciousness okay so this is kind of interesting so you know the the general idea is that we have mind okay and then we have the self or true consciousness and these are actually separate and then we have states of mind like waking dreaming and sleeping okay and then if you all have watched dr k's guide to meditation you'll you'll see that we have a very long video about states of mind where we also know that there are other kinds of states of mind like flow which is like diana okay so this is a state of meditation so we know that there are other states of mind as well and so it's it's kind of interesting there's a there's a great book that i have called the panchadashi and they explain this really well where they're like how do we know that sleeping is a state of mind and they make a very interesting observation which is that you're aware of sleep right so when you wake up in the morning you have an awareness that you've slept you have an awareness that you've slept enough you have an awareness that you've slept too much you have an awareness that you've slept too little and so what they sort of concluded is that awareness must be outside of the mind in order for it to observe and make conclusions about sleep it has to actually exist outside of the mind there are actually good physiologic counter arguments to this so this is something that yogis developed let's say 3 000 years ago in ancient india but since then we have learned a lot about the body the brain the mind the body and the brain for sure i don't know if we've really learned a whole lot more about the mind to be honest but and so there may be other ways that we kind of know this stuff outside of awareness so one example of this is that like you may have physiologic sensors like sensors of hunger and thirst and solute concentration and glycogen concentration and hormonal imbalances and things like hormonal balances that will indicate to you how long you've slept so it may not be some kind of cosmic awareness but simply your insulin to glucagon balance which gives your body a sense of a clock so you may have like a biological clock where oh based on how hungry i am and what my co solute concentration is and how much urine i produce and the balance between glucagon insulin and my current glycogen store level some part of my brain interprets all of that information and says i've slept for eight hours does that make sense so i i don't know that i personally agree with this like once you study it you can kind of make your own determination so having kind of done all these different also meditations around sleep and and awareness and stuff like that i think this is correct but it's important to point out that there may be simple physiologic reasons that don't have anything to do with a true self for true consciousness or anything like that okay so that's one perspective which is that dreams are just a state of mind a couple of other perspectives one is that dreams are places that you're past garmas can manifest or your some scars can manifest so let's look at each of these in turn let's start with some scars so if you all have been paying attention to us for a while you'll know what a samskara is if the concept of a samskara is new to you you can check out our our wiki i'm sure that we've got youtube videos about it but the best explanation of some scars is going to be in the vedic psychology section of dr k's guide okay so we have events that happen and when we have events happen we have some kind of um uh so we have an event okay when we have an event we produce an emotion but the emotion of the event gets there are two things that can happen to it one is it gets processed and one is it gets stored and oftentimes depending on the size of the event more of it will be processed and more of it will be stored so for example you know if i have something super traumatic if i plan a birthday party for myself and then i invite 30 of my friends and i have a bunch of food there what happens and no one shows up so i feel super sad so i feel sad on a level of 10 out of 10. and then what happens is i feel really sad about it i think about it i feel resentful for a while and then eventually after two hours pass and no one shows up i start playing video games so after two hours i've processed my emotion to an eight out of ten and then once i start playing video games this gets stored this goes dormant and then the next time i see my friends right because i haven't fully processed the emotion i see my friend the next day and what happens when i when i meet my friend this 8 out of 10 stored emotion comes up and reactivates in my mind and then i feel super super sad and angry and resentful and then my friend is like wait what's wrong what happened like why are you so upset with me they're super confused because this emotion is not coming from our current interaction right it's projected from the past on to the present so that's the idea of a some scar and so one way that a sum scar can be metabolized and processed or brought back up is through our dreams that's one eastern perspective the other thing to think about in terms of a karmic perspective is that when we commit an action we get some kind of consequence there's a principle of cause and effect and so it's kind of like if i have a neutron and i create a positron i have to create an electron as well right there's no way that i can just create a positron that any kind of action i take has to have some kind of reaction to it it's the principle of karma very similar to physics basically the only difference really is that the principle of karma assumes that this principle of every action has an equal and opposite reaction applies to more than just physics so like on any level of stuff like this all applies or you could sort of say that you know physics begets chemistry chemistry begets biochemistry biochemistry begets biology biology begets physiology physiology begets life life has a brain brains create psychology psychology creates behavioral economics behavioral economics creates economics psychology also on a mass scale creates sociology so at the end of everything like the root of everything is still physics and is still this principle of cause and effect if that kind of makes sense okay so what this sort of posits is that you know when when you take an action there's some kind of karmic debt to be paid and one of the interesting explorations that i made was i was sort of thinking about the suffering in dreams so i did a particular meditation technique that allows you to be aware in dreams very hard technique to do if you guys want to learn it today i can teach it to you today but it's going to be really hard so i had to practice this technique for months and that's on top of you know being a regular meditator for like years so it's an advanced technique of meditation and so what i did when i was doing this technique is i i observed the suffering that i experienced and what i i made an interesting observation that in the dream and in real life the quality of emotion is actually the same if you really think about your dreams the fear that you feel in your dreams is like a hundred percent the same and what i realized is like in my dreams i'm actually like so i sometimes will have negative dreams and you know as we mentioned before anxiety is the most common emotion that is represented in dreams negative emotions tend to be more common than positive emotions and all the negativity that i experience in dreams is like feels 100 real like i'm so terrified you'll wake up in a cold sweat and just terrified terrified terrified so i was kind of wondering what does that mean karmically so if i have some amount of like suffering or negative emotion that i've karmically signed up for in life do i sort of get rid of it by paying these like phantom dollars from the dreams do i pay this karmic debt in a dream it seems to me like that makes sense based on my personal experiences but i'm not saying that that is objectively correct so that's kind of a prevailing theory that i still kind of think about to this day um and so that's kind of a spiritual perspective on dreams right so what is a dream we don't know that is the best answer that is the answer that i feel the most confident in okay i don't know i don't know what a dream is um next thing to consider is okay so like if we don't know what a dream really is what do we know so we've tried to study dreams scientifically it turns out that they're actually really hard to study because generally speaking dreams we study the brain right and when it comes to the brain we have two major things that we need one is we need invasive methods because things like eeg and fmri are not sufficient so it's not like one part of the brain dreams so dreams are not necessarily neuroanatomically bound right so it's not like we have the dream center of the brain so since tools like fmri and eeg aren't specific enough what we would normally need to do is more invasive methods and generally speaking when we use invasive methods we use them on animals because we don't do that kind of research on people the problem with doing invasive research on animals is that animals can't tell us anything about their dreams so it's very hard to correlate the invasive scientific information with anything subjective from a dream so we're kind of handicapped in that way in our scientific exploration of dreams which is actually a really fascinating subject that i could give an entire lecture about really cool that being said we've figured a couple things out right so what we have done is we've done a lot of qualitative research we'll ask people what are you dreaming about what have we learned really interesting stuff first is that blind people can't see in their dreams so if you don't have some kind of experience you can't dream about it so it seems like dreams are composites of our own waking experiences okay um next thing to consider is that oftentimes dreams are emotional they tend to be the most common emotion in dreams is anxiety negative emotions tend to be more common than positive emotions eight to ten percent of dreams tend to be sexual in nature why don't we include that because people just wonder about that everyone wants to know about sexuality and dreams so that's just that's what we know okay and we're not really sure what purpose they serve okay so one hypothesis is that dreams are just completely rng they're byproducts or side effects of whatever restorative processes go on during sleep i personally don't put a whole lot of stock into that hypothesis because as i mentioned before basically nothing in our body is random like everything evolution has a has evolved a purpose for everything um we also do know that animals dream and i don't know if you all have have a pet but like you know i used to have pet dogs and watching them dream is fascinating you can tell that they're dreaming um and so we also know for example that children dream and children dream very very vividly so chances are it's doing something for them so what are some of the things that it could be doing what are some of the other purposes of dreams so people like freud and jung sort of hypothesize that we've got a subconscious and we've got a conscious so our subconscious has all kinds of thoughts and generally speaking those are kept in check by our conscious mind and so the dreaming state is the one state where the subconscious gets to throw a party without the conscious mind you know being around so parents aren't home time to throw a rager which is what a dream is there's also a perspective that dreams are symbolic in nature which is that you know the thing in the dream isn't actually what it means but it's a symbol for something else or dreams are thematic in nature where it's not so much that it's a symbol it's not a representation of something else but that generally is applicable it's just some of the details are changed so if i'm afraid of abandonment that may manifest in a dream with me being like left behind at a circus but the fear of abandonment is consistent so there's a thematic connection between my actual fears and the fears and the dream versus a symbolic connection which is like me being abandoned at the circus is actually a symbol of you know i i don't even i i don't know like becoming the the process of becoming independent as an adult like who knows like it's a symbol so it's it's not actually connected it's just one thing means something else okay i tend to uh put stock more into sort of thematic experience another option is that dreams are just like housekeeping in some way in terms of memory consolidation processing emotions things like that that's not mutually exclusive with sort of the freudian jungian subconscious perspective just another thing to consider dreams are used in psychotherapy generally speaking if you want like hardcore dream analysis with a lot of symbolic interpretation go see a psychoanalyst they're the ones who train in that the best although regular psychotherapists will also use dreams i sometimes use dreams to draw out emotional themes that may be relevant to patients there are some studies that show that working on dreams can be useful if you're stuck in psychotherapy last thing to consider is sort of a spiritual perspective so one is like in the eastern perspective we kind of look at dreams we're not really interested i don't know if this sort of makes sense but in the yogic perspective they're not really interested in the content of mind what they're really interested in is transcending mind entirely and so if that's the goal they sort of you view dreams as a state of consciousness and that's really the most important thing it's just a different state of consciousness the goal is still to move past all of that so we don't want to tunnel down into what your anxiety is we don't want to tunnel down into what your dream is the goal is transcending mind entirely other perspectives from kind of the eastern traditions is that dreams may have some connection to past lives karmic manifestations and then from a vedic psychology perspective this pent-up emotion can kind of manifest in dreams so here's kind of a quick overview right of dreams i'm not saying once again that this is necessarily correct but it's something that i've been super curious about and something that you know i thought i'd share today because people and people on our commute have been asking about dreams for like years you
