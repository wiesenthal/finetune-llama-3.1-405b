i have thought about the achievement of getting to high school getting to college going to everything and every time i keep thinking the next one's going to be the one but it never is can you tell me what you go by please uh yeah aspers asper welcome asper how are you feeling today um so i'm fine i'm a bit nervous but yeah uh so i guess i say when i come here like how am i feeling yeah sure if you're open to it so uh this is actually really good timing because just really recently i got a really important like life goal in my life and i just noticed i'm not really feeling too excited about it i just kind of bored them more than any other thing okay so yeah that's that's a bit the thing of how i'm feeling i'm just a bit disappointed that this would be a high in my life and it's just nothing changed really i see so so by got a life goal you mean you achieved a life goal yeah yes sir so yeah i i just graduated from college okay and so you climb to the top of the mountain the view isn't what you thought it would be yeah it's just i i don't know i you always imagine it's going to be so intense so great and then you can hear itself okay i i'm still just here okay exactly the same as i was the day before okay so um first of all congratulations at graduating from college okay thank you um i think it is an achievement but what i'm hearing is that it's not how are you expecting to feel i don't know because you always feel like like we we work by like uh you have you start something and you say okay when i finish imagine when i finish primary school okay now that's my goal finish primary school and then when you finish your go to high school okay let's finish high school and then when you finish you go to college and now i finish college and now it's like so now do i retire yeah it's it's just you don't look past that you just just work by frames and then suddenly this train was ended and i thought this would be a high achievement and it's just i don't know like life's going really smoothly but feels so pointless yeah i think um can i just repeat back kind of what i heard asper sure so we like focus on a goal right and the idea is that once we get to the end of the road and we achieve that goal we will be happy because you work really hard and you sacrifice to get to this goal and then you finish primary school and then you finish high school and then you finish college but like everything that you've worked for doesn't just it doesn't like magically you just don't feel like happy and accomplished all of a sudden even though you've done exactly what you set out to do and so now you're kind of like where is the achievement actually like where does it feel good how does it feel good yeah it's like we're just chasing constantly something and i don't even want it i just want to change face it and i don't even know why just start to bother like did you really want to chase that good i know it sounds kind of weird asper but i i think that's a fantastic way to think and feel does that sound thank you does that sound weird i mean i i i agree with you it makes sense in my head i just i'm not sure if it makes sense for the rest of people so i think this is where like what you're doing asper is like uh you know i haven't asked you how old you are and stuff like that but like i think this is what really growing up is about so we're told our entire life to do particular things and we're told if you do these things then you will be happy but somewhere along the way we have to sort of discover what happiness means for us whether following the script and there's still good reasons to you know graduate from college without it sort of making us feel happy forever but i think now is a really important because like i'm glad you're learning this now actually because i've worked with some people who are a little bit i'm assuming older than you are but maybe you're older who knows but there are a lot of people who will we sort of call it a treadmill right or like stair stepper where you're you keep on achieving stuff and then it's what what's next it's like okay college now you have to get this job you start out as an analyst then you get promoted to an associate then you get a pro promoted to a senior associate then you get promoted to a vice president then you get promoted to senior vice president and people are like when does this get fun yeah exactly that's what i was thinking like when when does the fun come like just when is it coming yeah so what do you think when do you think it comes i don't know just i like one year before i thought the fun would come when i graduated yes now now i don't know it'll it'll come when you get the the do you have a job are you getting a job asper no i mean i i graduated like last week so i haven't had time to even yeah so i'm sure it'll come when you find the job right i don't know anymore good i'm glad you're actually one step ahead of the game if you're not thinking okay like it'll come when i have the job because then if you get the job you know what you'll say next it'll come when i get promoted oh i was going to say it will come when i retire oh yeah and eventually it'll come when you retire yeah that's a great way to that's how you know so you live your whole life so that you can have fun for the last you know 20 years and and then you retire it is awful so here's the thing enjoyment is not about achievement which is really confusing for a lot of people you know people say it's about the journey not the destination have you heard that before yeah i have yeah and the thing is like what do you think about that so experience why it makes sense but i it doesn't make sense to me like then why do we chase achievement so much if it isn't even rewarding like i have i have thought about the achievement of getting to high school getting to college going to everything and every time i keep thinking the next one is going to be the one but it never is so why why do we do that that's a good question what do you think ah i have no idea honestly oh so i think there are two or three big reasons the first is that we look at people who have achieved who appear to be happy and we we can't duplicate internal work but we can duplicate external work does that make sense yeah so like you see someone happy to say i'm gonna do the same thing exactly so much so we as human beings what we what we notice what what like we can't measure what goes on in someone's mind but we can measure what they do right can you repeat the last part yeah so like we can see what they do we can't see what happens in their mind oh yeah definitely so then so that's a piece of it so that's where like like i don't know if this makes sense but so you know when i was studying to become a monk um what people noticed is that like monks don't eat like very tasty food like they don't eat like unhealthy like they don't eat cakes and cookies and things like that right so what people assumed is they're like okay if i want to be spiritual i need to restrict my eating and if i stop eating tasty food then i will become more spiritual and i will learn to control my desires and all that kind of stuff does that make sense yeah the problem is they're confusing what comes first it's not restricting food that allows a monk to not eat to become like in control it's their ability to like take a step back from desires they conquer the desire first and then it makes no difference what they eat does that make sense yeah so like okay i i think i i get it's like it's not that they eat uh they eat healthy stuff to get in control but it's just a a consequence yes so once they become in control through their meditative practice then like they don't care what they eat right because they're no longer controlled by their desires the problem is that what people see is oh look that person is in control of their desires and they never eat pizza therefore if i do what they do i will become in control of my desires does that make sense yeah so like if if you go to like i i may have seen people that graduate are graduating like they're working and they're happy and so i thought okay so they have graduated and are happy and so i will be happy if i graduate too exactly right so we we sometimes get confused between you know where does the happiness come from does it come from the achievement because the achievement is what we see what we don't see for example so we've had a couple people who've called in today who have got done therapy for a year or two or many so when we see someone who's like there are a couple people called in today who had had their life together and when you see someone who has their life together you see them going to work you see them whistling and stuff like that you're like i don't know how this person happened you never see the two years they spent in therapy does that make sense yeah yeah so why do we like focus on achievement because it's the only thing that's easily measurable you can't measure the internal work that people do to find happiness that's the first reason reason number two is that there are advantages towards prioritizing this kind of stuff and we sort of know that like you know if you're like homeless and you have no money and have no relationships the chances that you're happy are lower right so there is some correlation scientifically with achievement and happiness like at least you're not beating yourself up for dropping out of college or failing out of college does that make sense yeah i guess that's me so there is some kind of correlation there but basically it's like what we can measure um and the third thing is that when we are unhappy the mind does something very very subtle it looks at what we don't have and assumes that getting that thing will make us happy right okay so so if i'm lonely i assume that a relationship will make me happy if i haven't graduated from college what someone will do is they'll look at you they'll look at aspirin they'll be like i feel so bad about myself i failed out of college if i had graduated i would have been happy today if i was in a relationship i would be happy today if i was promoted i would be happy so they look at their own unhappiness and they assume that an external thing will fix their happiness which is why we chase achievement okay so i i have one question right so i i think i get what you mean the the thing now is then how the hell am i supposed to be happy fantastic question like i don't know my my whole life has always been like the that those frames and so if this is not giving me happiness then what am i going what am i supposed to do beautiful okay so have you ever been happy um i i mean i guess well it's i have had moments of happiness but in the sense like being comfortable like in long term i don't think so because there's always like no i'm not ready yet not ready for what to be happy oh so i'm not sure i understood that what do you mean by not ready to be happy it feels like there's this um feels like you haven't completed the game yet to like if the if the bounty is happiness you still have to you still have a lot of like quests yes yes so until you get those quests you can't really be happy that's unfortunately that's how my brain looks at excellent and that's why you're not happy right i guess because you're assuming that you have to do all these things to be happy so now asper you're in a beautiful place okay so you have to now learn what is happiness and where does it come from so let's think about this like so the first is you have this assumption that it comes from achievement and so now you're in the phase of your life where you have to like figure out where happiness comes from and the interesting thing is that we actually have very clear answers about where happiness comes from so um but we just don't teach this stuff okay so let's try to teach you in a moment the secret to happiness in life so there you said there are moments of your life where you've been happy right but yeah you're not happy like globally or permanently yeah i mean i i guess it's important to say like when i say what what i think about happiness like happiness and asking long term i feel like being comfortable with both my situation and myself like yeah being happy about it like yeah this is good okay are you comfortable with yourself in your situation i feel like there's so much work to do i feel like like i'm i just got out of college so now my brain is like no you're not ready until you get like really achieved professionally and like you are able to have your own house for example i don't know okay so i think those are all good goals but i think what you should do is pay attention to your happiness as you move towards them so do you feel more so like one step is college right so do you feel like happier now that you're done with college i mean a big weight has been off my shoulders but overall the reaction my like my brain has had has been pretty underwhelming okay good so let's understand theories of happiness so number one theory of happiness is that happiness is like building a house where i can put up the frame i can then put on the roof i can then add the windows i can put in a door i can put in the kitchen i can put in the plumbing the bathroom and all that kind of stuff but the house isn't complete until everything is done so it's not like i even feel 10 when 10 of that house is completed i don't feel like i have 10 of a house does that make sense it's not a home until it's like once you hit 100 completion rate then you have a home so happiness could be like that where you can go to college you can get a job you can buy a house and once everything is done then you will be happy at the end when you're 60 years old right you know i think that's definitely how my mind sees that's how we sort of think about it is the happiness the the completionist approach to happiness happiness but let's think about the so you've never felt permanently happy right uh no definitely i don't think right and that's where the the completionist theory is it's like we say like okay once everything is done then you'll be permanently happy right yeah okay do we know that permanent happiness exists i don't know you know you do hear stories of people saying that yeah they achieved happiness yeah so they got the achievement called happiness yeah and what do they say about it have you ever talked to them um well not from the top of my head i don't i don't know if i can think of someone that says that and i have oh talk to them okay right so like this is a great place to start is like have you met someone who you feel is permanently happy no probably not okay so now this is kind of scary asper because we're chasing something that may not exist right and yeah if if if it does exist and we meet people we could just ask them hey how did you become happy and we just listen to what they say right but then they will say like each one has to have their own home you can just copy other person's home and assume that will give you hold on if you don't do that you're coming up with answers that are not based in reality yeah i mean this like what the mind would say yeah so that's what your mind says right because you're not permanently happy so the whole point is we're not going to trust that organ because like if we meet someone who's super happy we can ask them and see what they say so what does what do you know about happiness oh god what what i do know how i heard well now i'm not so sure no you but they're good so now we're going to start questioning things but what do you know about times in your life where you've been happy like have you ever been happy for even a brief period of time yeah i was yeah so tell me about it so there's maybe a bit too specific and silly but the recent one was i was uh playing monster hunter with a friend and just there's a in the final boss there's a moment where you like activate something called the dragonater and you attack the final boss and then this really epic music kicks in and that that i was really happy at that moment i was feeling it i think that's the reason most happy okay this everything was so epic okay and and so let's unpack that a little bit what do you think it was that made that moment happy ah i i don't know it's everything was like so epic i was like having so much fun and i felt really immersed in that at the moment and i was with a friend and we were both like yeah let's go um yeah it was a little bit of everything i guess okay a little bit of everything meaning what were the components um game epic music good friends uh winning i guess and just entering kind of that flow state in the game ah interesting okay so if you were to play monster hunter again with a friend and you were to beat the game again or fight the final boss would you be equally happy i we we did repeat the final post yesterday and i got close to that point maybe not the first because the first time you're just like you don't expect that uh the music and everything was just the first time for everything but it did get close okay you know the game clicked and we i felt really comfortable playing and like the moves were snapping into place i guess okay so i think there's a there's a lot of answers here so first of all so you did it with a friend it was a particular boss it was the end of the game the music is the same both times right so like why aren't if all of the circumstances are the same why isn't the happiness the same what's different between time number one and time number two uh the expectation i guess okay so that's really important right so you could say it's the novelty so one option is that in order to be happy we have to keep on doing new stuff and so what that means is that i can never eat at the same restaurant twice because that's going to reduce my happiness i can never be in the same relationship for longer than six months because dating more people means more happiness i can't play the same video game over and over and over and over and over again i have to constantly be playing new video games right does that what do you think about that no no no there will be a complete train ring okay so it's not novelty and yet there's a difference between time number one and time number two and you come down to this phrase expectation so yeah have you seen morbius i have not nor i have seen most of the memes i'm actually quite lost i don't really know why more views is all over the place right so like morbius is a great example of expectation so some people even they re-released the movie because they were like oh this is such a meme everyone's everyone's so it's so funny people will enjoy the movie because it's so bad but it's like it's a classic example of like just everything with expectation going wrong it's a crap movie it's a meme but no no one's gonna enjoy it even if it's a meme so the first thing to understand about happiness is expectation so if i so like getting a gift on your birthday that you really really love is fantastic do you think you would enjoy that gift more or less if you got it on a day that was not your birthday yeah i think i think i i'd get it like if i got it just some random day and i didn't expect it i it would be like it would be more of a surprise like a pleasant surprise right so now let me ask you a question so let's say i get a mediocre gift on a random day of the week and i get a mediocre gift on my birthday which one am i going to enjoy more i should definitely they're going to enjoy more than mediocre like in a random day right because even if i get the same damn gift on my birthday and it's mediocre what am i going to feel disappointed what the it's the same day of a gift but on one day it results in disappointment and on another day it's a pleasant surprise yeah that and so i see what you did and so here we are like we're looking at oh like look at that person has a new apple watch they must be so happy has nothing to do with the apple watch they could be happy but it's all around the circumstances of our mind so you mentioned a couple of other things so the first thing that i want you to think about is expectation because what's different i didn't expect the music to be so epic by the way asper thanks for ruining the end of monster hunter for everyone because now we know it's going to be an epic experience and none of us are going to enjoy it quite as much oh i'm so sorry you know what i'm saying though but i'm joking but i didn't say what monster yeah sure but now we know that there's epic music right so the moment that we start to expect something our happiness is going to decline yeah second thing is you said you were immersed in monster hunter you're feeling it right you are completely there in the present moment yeah so this is where there's a very old very simple principle you can't be anxious in the present and you can't have regret in the present anxiety is in the future and regret is in the past so can you repeat that yeah so anxiety is in the future and regret is in the past okay so when my mind is making a mistake i'm totally fine regret happens afterward when i'm about to make a mistake and after i've made a mistake my mind can be disturbed but when i'm immersed in the present is when i'm having a really good time does that make sense that's kind of mind-blowing it feels right yep right so now you have to experiment with this stuff so this is why people love the flow set because even if you're thinking about work people say okay work isn't fun but i've had times of my life like this is actually close to one of them where i'm having a blast i'm working right now right it's all about being present and free of expectation if you do two things you will be happy it's simple i this is already helping because i already catch my soul thinking like yeah i should be a streamer okay so it was like so you're happy working and you're a streamer i should be a streamer too therefore i be happy i catch myself thinking yeah got to be very dangerous i'm not i don't even think i i don't think this i'm just talking to someone i just happen to be streaming i don't think of myself as a streamer i'm you know but what did you mean you're the best well i appreciate that but i you know so so this is why this is the other thing asper that i'll tell you is that there's also this idea that there is um that happiness is like a permanent state that you can achieve and the more that we sort of try to like make a life that will automatically give us happiness is when we really shoot ourselves in the foot yeah because the truth of the matter is that happiness is about the present moment and you can't be happy forever and it's that thought that everyone's like i want to make happiness like guaranteed it's the guarantee of happiness that prevents us from ever being happy does that make sense what once you start to realize that happiness is only temporary that's the most it ever gets it transforms the way that you live your life because then it's more like leaving the moment exactly and then you also appreciate because you recognize that the joy that i feel in this moment there is no way to make it last forever this is only going to last for this moment in time so man i'm gonna enjoy every second of it the music is epic i have the dragonater my friend is here this is a once in a lifetime opportunity that i will never be able to get back and then you start to live your life with intensity and passion that is completely foreign to everyone who's looking for a promotion the really bizarre thing is that when you start living your life this way you start getting promoted because you're doing your work with passion and intensity and your boss sees it and you're like wow this person is amazing and then they promote you and everyone sees you they're like this person is promoted and they're loving life therefore i should get promoted too and what they don't realize is what's on the inside i mean it makes a lot of sense it's just i i'm it's it makes too much sense so i'm a bit like stunned these are stun like me dr k okay well thankfully there's no there's no ko coming it's just the stun lock and i'm going to wait until the stun goes off and they were right oh no that that was great so asper i want you to start studying yourself look for happiness today alone now this doesn't mean that you should live a life of hedonism because even if you try that you'll discover that that's not the case because we've already figured out oh i playing monster hunter all day long is not going to make you happy right you've already like you just that's it there's just one chance and you can go chasing games time and time and time it's not going to work what you'll actually discover is other things will kind of make you happy what you'll really discover is it's not happiness is not in the object itself fundamentally but it's in here and it's in your presence in your expectation and once you realize that happiness is temporary then you'll start to really like love life great awesome okay good luck to you thanks a lot dr k you're very welcome that was like i expected it to be useful but not so much like damn okay okay well that was good we'll only disappoint you next time well maybe maybe like the second time we beat the monster it's still it's still going to be good okay well i'm glad it was useful to you ask but it was an absolute pleasure for me yeah i'm glad and hopefully people can relate to this oh i think everyone's relating to it it's a really common problem where we're taught to chase happiness without even being taught what it is it's also like sometimes just uh i want to say like sometimes get hard like because you see in the community all of these people that have all these problems and things and then you're always like so where's the space for people who actually have it okay like i'm my life's going perfectly fine and still so i don't know it's it's kind of weird but it feels good to hear that i still have problems that can be solved you know like yum this is the peak of life my life is perfect no it's not ask for you're just getting started sorry yeah i i tend to do that i'm sorry that's great no i love it it makes me happy to hear i'm very excited for the journey that you're just beginning to walk and and i i'm very i think you're quite blessed to discover this confusion at such an early age because what people will do is they'll live their whole life assuming that next year they'll be happy and their entire life will pass them by hopefully that's not me i don't think it is and and i i also wanna really appreciate what you said that sometimes you know this community becomes the most prominent voices are the ones that are suffering and we're here to help those people too for sure but i i think that like part of what this community is is it's like more than just you know those people those people absolutely belong here but everyone is allowed no matter whether you're advanced in life or not advanced in life or however you want to rank it everyone's welcome here and everyone is is we're here to support everyone and help everyone grow whether you're a seed a sapling a tree we're still here to help you grow no matter how far you are and i really appreciate your perspective yeah like the feeling that you don't deserve to suffer because you're doing so well yeah no but so as we'll discover one day maybe we'll talk about this one day where we've discovered what happiness is and we'll also we can also understand what suffering is and the interesting thing that you know this is what the buddha learned and discovered is that no amount of achievement will make you immune to suffering in the same way that no amount of achievement will guarantee you happiness or contentment yeah that makes cool thank you so much for calling in i think this is a fantastic call to end with and i'm really glad we did one more yeah i'm glad to take care this is a joke it feels really weird to hear you actually live i still feel like i'm just watching a stream and talking to myself okay it's really weird but yeah you take care thank you thank you so much take care for this and for everything in general of course thank you so much for calling in asper take care bye you
