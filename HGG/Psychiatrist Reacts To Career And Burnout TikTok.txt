which by definition means that instead of having people who excel at their jobs we end up with a whole company where everyone is mediocre let's take a look at some ADHD tick tocks on burnout very excited to offer you the opportunity to take on more responsibility here you mean like a promotion like an opportunity oh my God I'm very excited to offer you the opportunity to take on more responsibility here you mean like a promotion like an opportunity like an unpaid promotion so you get it yeah okay I was really hoping we are going to fill that role with an external hire who we're going to offer just like and obscene compensation package okay honestly though like like an embarrassing amount of money right I can't offer you an interview though to keep your hopes up so you'll take on all the roles responsibilities while we look for a replacement if I do a good job maybe you will give me the permission absolutely not I intend to keep you in your current role at your current salary until you burn out and quit of course yeah yeah cool I'm all right so this is great for a number of reasons um so first let's understand like how accurate this is so I think this can be very accurate so in my experience there are two kinds of companies some companies will do this where they'll sort of figure out that someone is in a particular role and it's more trouble than it's worth to move that person out of a role and then like find a replacement so let's just think about this let's say that there's like a managerial position that opens up at your company and you want to get promoted so right now they have to fill and train one role right because even if you get promoted you're going to have new responsibilities there's going to be an onboarding process there may be some other Dynamics at play so like let's say you've got five different colleagues and you get promoted and now they're reporting into you that can create different kinds of trouble so if they promote you not only do they have to onboard and do that kind of stuff but they also have to potentially fill your role that is now vacated so now they have to onboard two people so there are kind of two transitions so sometimes companies kind of think like this and they will you know they'll kind of do this sort of stuff the other thing is that sometimes companies do want to give people opportunities to do extra unpaid stuff and that's one of the ways in which companies want or give people opportunities to distinguish themselves and that's where I'd say like we've got to be a little bit careful here because there are two kinds of companies that I've seen one is like okay this is actually an opportunity for you to distinguish yourself and here's the key thing if you do a good job at distinguishing yourself what is the outcome because for some places that actually results in hey we really noticed that you went above and beyond so you were actually like that's an advantage for promotions raises new projects Etc moving over to this other team like there are actually advantages to going above and beyond the challenge is that there are some companies that expect people to go above and beyond for no additional stuff even like longitudinally and overtime and they expect everyone to do extra unpaid stuff you know and that's just kind of like how it is the other thing to keep in mind which I think we got kind of got to say is that I think a lot of tick tocks like this they resonate with a lot of people but I think there are other perspectives to consider here the first is that sometimes if you're let's just talk about outside hires so I'm going to just tunnel down into this so if there's a managerial spot that opens up and you work at a particular company you may think okay like they should promote from within and like I'm a good candidate so this is where sometimes like unfortunately like promoting from within is not actually the best option so I'll give you all just a simple example so I've worked with real estate Developers for example that have real estate agents that are like really good at sales and a managerial position opens up and so people may think like okay like so I should be first in line to be promoted because I do a really really good job at sales the challenge though is that that promoting people within a company actually oftentimes changes their responsibilities and just because someone did really good at their current job doesn't mean that they'll actually adapt well to the responsibilities of the promotion so if you're good at sales like you may not be as good at managing as you are at sales and you can look at someone like Michael Scott as a prime example of that right that's fictitious but it's based in reality there's another really interesting aspect here called the Peter Principle which is sort of tongue-in-cheek I don't know how data based it is but it's this idea that we promote people to the level of their incompetence and I know that sounds kind of weird but what that sort of presumes is that most people at companies are not ideally suited for the job that they have and here's how the Peter Principle Works let's say I'm really great at sales I excel I do really fantastic I distinguish myself I get promoted to a manager if I excel at being a manager what happens I get promoted to let's say VP or c-suite or something like that but if I do a mediocre job as as a manager what actually happens is I never get promoted and I just kind of stagnate there which means that what we're selecting for is the people who do really really good at job a actually get promoted out of it until they start doing mediocre and once they start doing mediocre they sort of stay there because they're not able to distinguish themselves which by definition means that instead of having people who excel at their jobs we end up with a whole company where everyone is mediocre so it's a really interesting principle and something to kind of think about when you're sort of considering promotion one thing that I would highly highly recommend is that if you're interested in getting internally promoted you really think a little bit about what that what how that job skill sets may be different from your own and make a strong case not on the work that you've done but why you would be a good fit for that position and so that's it's a it's a good good take though I think sometimes unfortunately this is absolutely the case where they'll just sort of give you a pro forma interview to kind of like keep you there I have absolutely seen predatory companies like that only one cup I don't know why it came out like that what's up quite quitting I have heard yep basically an idea that people are burnt out so they're not actually quitting their jobs but they're quitting going above and beyond so they're not letting their job take over their life what do I think I don't love the quiet part but I get it what employees gonna tell their boss I'm too stressed I need help finding balance not enough so they either stay stressed or they actually quit or they take steps to decide to do it themselves and quite quit do I think our people are I don't know but a good way would be to bring it up take out the quiet part I bet a ton of executives are having this same conversation but not raising it to employees what if you were to ask employees what do you think about quiet quitting many might be shocked that you're bringing it up at all but managers have to be open to finding ways to have conversations about productivity having their own lives I'm happy to write out what they can say this is not a wing it topic hey Luke so that's actually really fantastic I love this person's take on it because they're talking about actually engaging in conversation so here's the problem that we've created with the term quiet quitting so do employers want their employees to quiet quit right like if you think about it that sounds like a fireable offense and so even with the phrase quiet quitting what you've done is make it hard to actually engage in a conversation because it's like hey like who here is quiet quitting like what employee is going to raise their hand when they're like yeah I'm quiet quitting and what does quiet quitting mean it just means not going above and beyond it means just doing your job which by the way is also really bizarre because why on Earth are we calling doing your job quitting since when did doing your actual job become quitting like what the hell is going on here this whole phrase is like so problematic and we've started to call okay yeah these guys are quitters what do you mean quitters how are they quitting well they're just doing their job it's like what the hell that's not quitting that's doing your job the whole phrase is so misdirected misunderstood and um I don't know how to say this like it's like it's damning so you can't have a conversation about it which is what I think this person is kind of alluding to is that people need to learn how to have conversations about it the other thing to consider about quiet quitting is why are people quiet quitting this is important I don't think it's always because of burnout so burnout is on the rise and people not going above and beyond is on the rise does that mean that the two are related they can be but here's the biggest reason that I see for quiet quitting so when you go above and beyond what do you get in return if you don't get promoted if you don't get a raise if you don't get recognition why would you continue going above and beyond it's not burnout it's just pavlovian so when someone puts in extra effort if that effort is recognized that's ideal right and if people if that effort isn't recognized then people are going to stop doing it right now there's an interesting thing that we found in coaching which is that there can be a cognitive bias at play here where everyone thinks they're doing extra whereas sometimes what they're sort of doing is like that's not really extra it can actually be part of their job or they're doing a lot this is the other thing that we see so often in in career coaching is that people are doing extra that doesn't actually like the company doesn't value or people don't really care about and in that case I think it's totally fine to not invest that effort I mean we'll advocate for people to think about what the company actually cares about and invest extra in a way that the company will appreciate as opposed to just investing extra but I think this is like a really really important point to kind of think about and I think the whole phrase is so damning that it's very hard to talk about and like I don't know when doing your job how we started calling doing your job quitting it's like I can see how this phrase has caught on so much because I think there's a group of managers out there who fundamentally believe their employees are lazy and if you're a manager who fundamentally believes your employee is lazy having them do their job is quitting in your eyes and somewhere along the way what's also happened is that going above and beyond has become the standard right where it's like oh everyone like we want go-getters we want people to go above and beyond I think going above and beyond honestly I think it's great like I I don't I I gotta be honest with y'all so when I was in med school I tried to go above and beyond when I was in residency I tried to go above and beyond here at HG I tried to go above and beyond I still try to go above and beyond I think it's good it's just you need to have a relationship where people recognize that and you go above and beyond in a way that is understood and hopefully appreciated three signs or cortisol levels are high part two hi my name is Christine Cohen I'm a mental health dietitian who helps stress professionals overcome burnout naturally in their 30s the first one is any level of anxiety so that is chronic anxiety that any level of anxiety is a sign of high cortisol you experience at a mild level all the way up to anxiety and second is finding yourself feeling really frustrated really irritated often all the way up to exploding rage this is a sign that your cortisol levels are high and the third is intense cravings for carbs sugar salty and even alcohol throughout the day but definitely later in the day and after dinner if you experience these symptoms often it's a sign that you're living in fight or flight mode and your cortisol levels are imbalanced to learn more about why this is happening and how to naturally balance yourself back out go download my free guide and learn more so I'm not sure so this person is a dietitian so they may know more about this than I do but some of the some stuff about this like makes me kind of concerned um so the first is that I'm not quite sure if they're talking about cortisol or they're talking about burnout or if they assume that the two are automatically linked so I know this sounds kind of weird and this person may know more about this than I do but like I'm not sure that hyper cortisol and burnout are actually like correlated it makes sense that they are because burnout is sort of a high stress State you have a high level of cortisol and there's a lot of stuff here that I think is scientifically like it you know it sounds like they really know what they're talking about in terms of craving of of carbohydrates and stuff that can be consistent with cortisol but when they say any level of anxiety I'm That Kind of confuses me because I think like anxiety like mild anxiety and feeling anxiety is not a sign of hypercholesterolemia or Addison's disease and I mean it can be right so like anxiety is one of the manifestations of high cortisol but this is once again I think this isn't so much about this person as it is about Tick Tock which is like you know I think some degree of anxiety is within the normal range of Human Experience and so I I'm just not sure when I when I watch stuff like this I don't know if this person uh you know if this is I'd like to think that this is a restriction of the platform because in 56 seconds how can you accurately explain cortisol burnout anxiety and help people understand what's going on could it be a high cortisol level sure could it be a burnout level uh burnout sure but some of this stuff this is what kind of makes me a little bit hesitant about this kind of stuff is I don't know what exactly this person is referring to I don't really know how scientific it is but it does seem like they do this kind of work and so they've had a lot of like good outcomes with their clients is what I'm assuming and by the way that can be completely valid too because oftentimes what you see is that before you have scientific evidence of an intervention you'll have people out there working with human beings who will develop a high level of confidence in the intervention that happens before scientific validation a great example of that is meditation so why do we have research studies on meditation it's because a bunch of people like in the 60s learned how to meditate and they're like wow this is actually amazing and will help with anxiety and depression and at that point scientists would have said you're full of BS and so then what people happen what happened is they actually made studies about it so it's not uncommon for people who are in a clinical role or this person seems like a dietitian to actually make discoveries about what helps people prior to Scientific evidence so something to just keep in mind you know so I'd say just take it with a grain of salt sounds like their heart is in the right place they may know more about it than I do but I'm a little bit skeptical of some of the generalizations that they make I think one of the saddest parts of working with people who are experiencing burnout is that when you ask them like what they want like I asked them what they wish they were including it is such reasonable things it's like I want to have time to eat breakfast and lunch I want to get off of work before 6 PM I want to have time on the weekends without feeling guilt for not catching up on work I want to spend time with friends and family I don't want to have trouble sleeping because I have so much anxiety like very reasonable human things burnout is not just stress in the workplace it's what that stress in the workplace costs you it's just very unfair because burnout is like that the meeting point of industry and industry's bottom line and just people like people trying to do their best especially like high Achievers and people Pleasers who want to make those companies happy not realizing that no amount of work from them would be enough so this is really interesting so I think the it highlights something and I'm curious kind of what y'all think about this but if burnout is the intersection of people Pleasers and companies where do you think the fault lies right like let's just think about that for a second um and let's take a quick look at the next one this one I think we're gonna go so so I think this this really highlights kind of a good point so when I'm asking like okay who's at fault here people are saying some people are saying mostly companies and some people are saying both here's our experience with burnout and there's science to kind of back this up so I think the biggest problem with burnout that's going on right now is that companies are blaming employees and they're saying oh burnout is something that you need to handle so we're going to give you a free subscription to a mindfulness app so that you can meditate and be less burnt out and employees are blaming companies and they're saying your work environment is so stressful like you're the reason that I'm burnt out and my company always asks for more always ask for more always ask for more and I'm a people pleaser so here's the wild thing that we've discovered and this is based on science so the first thing is let's start with the science so burnout is the intersection of job plus personal and if you all have seen like our interviews like we did an interview with a a developer who's burnt out at the last four companies that they've worked at and what we tend to find is oh if someone's a people pleaser and like let's say your boss is like really nice boss and it's like hey we've got a like something else that's kind of come in the pipeline there's a possible deal anyone have anyone interested in kind of taking it on and then the people pleaser is like yeah me and they're like okay cool you want to take it on go for it and then a week later a boss is like hey we've got something else coming on like anyone interested in taking it on people pleaser is like or the boss asks like hey do you have bandwidth for an additional product project people pleaser is like I'm not allowed to say no I'm afraid of what my boss will think when I say no so I'm gonna say yes even though they don't have the bandwidth and so from the boss's perspective let's assume for a moment the boss is nice he or she is a nice boss and they're actually genuinely asking hey are you like at capacity or do you have space for something else you tell me if you tell me you're at capacity it's totally fine like I'm not going to think any less of you I respect you as an employee I respect your ability to manage your own work you're hard working you're not a slacker so I am trusting you to tell me where you are I'm actually trusting and respecting you but the people pleaser is like I never want to say no to anything because that makes me feel bad on the inside so this is the harsh discovery that we made when we work with people who are burnt out and we've worked with a lot of them is that a lot of it is internal half of it is internal half of it is company and what we do is we work with people to help them understand okay like if you're a people pleaser the solution is not for you know corporations I mean I guess that they could be we've done some Consulting in that it's a corporate you know companies to like adapt to some human beings who are people pleasing the real solution and I say this is a clinician who's worked with tons of people Pleasers is like if you're people pleasing in your job you're also people pleasing in your personal relationships you're also people pleasing like in your you know friendships parental relationships family relationships romantic relationships and so if you're a people pleaser at the cost of yourself because you don't value yourself like that's something that needs to be changed on you there are absolutely toxic elements from the corporate world don't get me wrong who will take advantage of people Pleasers and I encourage you all to like watch the interviews and stuff because what we've really seen is that fixing burnout is addressing some things at the company level but it's also addressing a lot of things at the individual level and to be blunt we see far far far better outcomes addressing things at the individual level than we do at addressing things at the company level because if we address things at an individual level if we can take a people pleaser and have them stop being a people pleaser they're going to do way better way faster than trying to do a corporate training that gets managers to understand people Pleasers so the unit of change when we focus on the individual what we find is that the yield is a lot better right so it's like okay like let's say that we've got someone who struggles to eat healthy what we can do is we can absolutely go to a government FDA and we can say hey you all have to change advertising you need to add this nutrition facts you need to put warnings on food you have to do this and this and this to warn people of the dangers you have to make it hard for people to buy this stuff we need to increase the taxes on sodas we need to do all of this worldwide stuff to help people who eat in an unhealthy way I think all that stuff is fantastic but if you are someone who struggles to eat healthy I would encourage you I don't think you can wait for all that to happen that the people who end up eating healthy are the ones who make a personal change now does that absolve everyone else's responsibility no what I'm talking about is efficacy not fairness not responsibility I think it's unfair and what are we going to do about it so you have to work a little bit on your own right and so what we try to do is we help people first of all understand okay are you people pleaser and then even like role play dialogue out how do you have a conversation with your manager because if your manager is actually nice the cool thing about this is that if your manager is nice you can actually go to them and say hey I have a tendency to like people please and so here's a sample dialogue that I would encourage right so these are the kinds of things that we'll talk people through so how do you talk to your manager about being a people pleaser real quick if you go to your manager and you say hey I really enjoy working for you I think you're a fantastic person I like my job here one of the things that I really struggle with is that anytime someone at this job asks for help I have difficulty saying no but I actually think that I get too much on my plate and it stresses me out I wanna I wanna help out I want this company to succeed I want to look good myself I want to make you look good I I want the mission of the company let's say I work at a hospital right so I care about patients and I want to help out my fellow nurses when something you know when there's like a shortfall in nursing but what I'm noticing is that like it's hard for me to say no and I'm getting like really really stressed out and it's like impacting my work can you help me with this can you help me set boundaries around a healthy level of work and it's amazing when you go to your you're not saying hey I'm lazy hey y'all are taking advantage of me you're an evil Corporation you're like hey this is something that I really struggle with will you help me and what's really awesome is like most managers will be like absolutely we'd love to help you okay let's think about this how can we set limits on how much you actually work I'm going to talk to the charge nurse about this let's try to figure out like what's a good plan because most people are like good human beings the problem is we're never taught how to approach these conversations and we just are like oh like the the hospital is predatory like it may be true but I don't think that you're I mean sometimes you have a toxic boss but generally speaking like people want to help each other out right because your boss may be a people pleaser too do you ever think about that and if you come to them and you say hey I'm stressed out your boss being a people pleaser is like oh no let me fix that for you right because if you're a people pleaser and you go the extra while what happens you get up you get promoted to being the boss and did the people pleaserness go away of course not make sense okay questions so trash can Raider is saying I think you're overestimating people Maybe it hasn't been my experience so I'm estimating People based on my experience and what I've learned is that when you over when you think if you think I'm overestimating colleagues or people what I've really found is that effective communication or ineffective communication will result in how people respond to you so I can understand why you're like oh you're overestimating people because when I talk to people it doesn't work like that so that's where I challenge you a little bit I'm not saying that you're wrong right so my first job was like serving up ice cream and I've had other like kind of basic labor sort of jobs over the years so I've done that kind of work but I'm also now for the last like decade in a position that has a lot of professional respect so my life is gonna like my experience is gonna be different I've worked with a ton of people though and what I really found is that there's a right way to talk to people and when you talk to people the right way then it really helps or improves your chances but I've absolutely heard my fair share of horror stories and situations where talking to your boss about how you're stressed out and you have this difficulty causes them to like hop on and say okay cool let's take advantage of that I'm not saying I'm not I I I'm not saying you all are wrong I'm just saying it's you have to be careful about assuming the world is a particular way and that effort or change or learning something new on your part is not going to change that thank you it's challenging okay so real Riker is asking how do you manage your burnout when you might be expected to work even late to get stuff done so that's a great question so what I would say is where does that expectation come from where is the expectation that you have to work late that's how you challenge it from the beginning so if you have to work late why is that there could be all kinds of reasons that you have to work late I've had to work late so some of that is like learning curve so is it temporary or is it that you have difficulty with something that most people in your job don't have difficulty with so for example you know I had a colleague who was dyslexic and so Physicians take notes and so we have to like take notes and we have to do like documentation and that may be for some of us it would take an hour for this person it would take an hour and a half and so sometimes things are just going to take longer for you and that you know is that where the expectation comes from or is the default that oh like this is a normal amount of work and people have to work 14 hours a day and that's just accepted so some Industries are like that like banking working late is a part of the job and how does banking make up for it they compensate you with hundreds of thousands or millions of dollars per year and it's just an expectation that like hey you're going to work your ass off and we're going to pay you a lot you're going to burn out you're going to stress this is the trade so it just depends I would say where is that expectation of you working late coming from uh Prime is asking question as part of burnout related to lack of community um yes so there are six scientific factors that contribute to burnout and I think lack of community or isolation is absolutely one of them all right shall we move on to um great catching you at twitchcon by the way Prime but does it have to be that way in the banking industry I personally don't think so but people in the banking and as many people high up in the banking industry disagree with me there's something really interesting going on in the banking industry right now which is that we're seeing a very very subtle shift to so the standard in the banking industry is that you work people to the Bone and then turnover rates are really really high so what happens is like you've got people you're like I want you to work 100 hours a week and a bunch of people are going to try some people are going to excel and when they Excel like you're gonna promote them you're going to give them a lot of money but then what's what happens a lot is that person the grass is going to be greener on the other side so they're going to go somewhere else because they're your they're your golden child at your bank so they go to some other bank and they're like hey I'm The Golden Child over here what will y'all give me and then another the other bank says okay we'll give you like 50 more golden child comes back to your bank and is like hey these people are offering me 50 more can you all match it and you're like no we can't match it and then the person leaves so what actually happens in in banking is that there's a real retention problem for your best employees there's also a retention problem for your not best employees because you've got a golden child who you're struggling to keep and maybe you pay them 50 more and then you've got the other four people in their cohort who are not golden children who are getting paid less now 66 percent of what the golden child is getting and so they'll end up leaving too because they don't think it's fair because Golden Child is working 100 hours a week they're working 100 hours a week one person is getting paid 50 more so they leave so turnover is a huge huge problem in banking everyone's moving around all the time what we're starting to see is there's a small crop of people who really care about building a team and care about the humans and what they've really discovered which is crazy is that if someone enjoys working for you they'll actually turn down 50 more money to stay with you because the toxicity isn't worth the money and you may be thinking that's crazy 50 more money but at some point like money has diminishing returns for some people for some people it doesn't and it's just the more the better it's a way to keep score in life so we're starting to see I'm starting to see this change in banking where like some people actually genuinely care they work less they don't work people to the Bone you're allowed to have kids whenever you want it's totally fine we're going to support you and that's worth so much
