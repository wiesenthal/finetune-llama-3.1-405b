in an effort to try to support these lonely men what we're actually doing is adopting views that are very justifiably criticized but in justifiably criticizing those particular views we're actually invalidating the core of the problem so this article about the rise of lonely single men was written by a psy d and talks about how dating opportunities for heterosexual men are diminishing as relationship standards rise men represent approximately 62 percent of dating app users lowering their chances for matches men need to address skill deficits to meet healthier relationship expectations so i've been linked this article by multiple people which is part of why we're addressing it and today what i'd love to do is is talk a little bit about you know is there a rise of lonely single men if there is a rise why that's happening and what we understand about you know where this is coming from i'd also like to talk a little bit about what makes this what makes it hard for people to be empathic to single lonely men and i think men have a hand in that so we're going to talk a little bit about why this is such a hot topic so even already i want you all to pay attention to yourself and as i say i'm going to talk about this notice the emotional reaction that you're having right so maybe you're sort of thinking like oh this is fantastic that that dr k is talking about this this really needs to be addressed or maybe you're thinking oh my god not another discussion about you know toxic lonely single men and we're going to be sort of exploring that sort of reaction and why that happens and both are completely valid perspectives we're also going to touch a little bit we've done this for a a couple of times the sometimes very unsuccessfully we're going to talk a little bit about gender dynamics just sort of in a general sense and this is something that i think has been a hot button issue for the internet and it's been a hot button issue for us but what we're sort of noticing in our community is that it's an ongoing concern for so many people and i have faith that if we kind of keep trying we'll eventually sort of figure out how to sort of deal with this kind of stuff in a healthier way the other thing that we're going to address today is sort of how to critically read articles so we're going to not only be looking at this article and sort of like tunneling down a little bit about the editorial process and things like that because sometimes i don't know if you all are kind of aware of this but like you know psychology today and other publications are trying to get views right so they'll sort of pick titles and things like that that that are kind of quite inflammatory and will create emotional reactions but we're going to tunnel down and look a little bit more critically at the sources that are cited what the actual sources say and i encourage all of you to really be critical when you're reading articles so instead of sort of rejecting this article because it doesn't agree with your world view or you know gobbling it up without any sort of critical thought because it mirrors your own experience what i think we really need to do especially as articles are getting more and more clickbaity is to sort of think a little bit critically about the points that they're making and what's supported by data and what isn't i want to check in with y'all for a second about first of all how do y'all feel about this is this okay for us to talk about are these like acceptable goals is there is there's an acceptable sort of nuanced or critical way to look at this okay awesome so there's going to be a couple dimensions we're not just going to be talking about this we're also going to be talking about gender dynamics and critically looking at articles okay so it's going to be like it's not just oh like it's so simple this is what's going on men are screwed period end of the end of it no it's so much more nuanced than that okay so let's start with a couple of acknowledgments just about gender in general okay so something that's going on right now on the internet is that people will talk about a specific gender related issue so for example this article cites multiple things that are specific to men so this article will say things like oh it's more challenging for men on dating apps because 62 percent of dating app users are men there will also be they also cite other sources for example that say that 46 of men will swipe right or or will like or you know move forward with a particular dating profile whereas 14 of women will swipe right or like or whatever whatever the equivalent is right so we can look at those statistics and what a lot of people will conclude is oh see things on dating apps are harder for men than they are for women now this is a perspective that i think we've got to be really really careful about because remember that any time there's a particular article there may be particular dimensions that are more difficult for men but it doesn't necessarily mean that online dating is easier for men as a whole than it is for women so for example there may be some things which are in quote unquote women's favor or against men but then there are other things that are like in favor of men as opposed to women so for example intimate intrusions online studying the normalization of abuse and dating apps or online inclusivity or sexual harassment conceptualizing women's experiences in the digital age these are both primary literature uh studies right so these are not like editorial articles these are peer-reviewed public published research my point is that if we're going to wade into gender dynamics we need to understand that just because a particular thing is easier or harder for a particular gender in a particular place does not mean that that gender has it harder globally or has it easier globally do you all get that this is a huge thing that you know you kind of learn in medicine and just to give you all a very simple example so just because breast cancer is more common than testicular cancer doesn't mean that it isn't hard for people to get testicular cancer that it sucks if people get to testicular cancer or you know any of those other things when you are a practicing physician what you start to learn is that there's sort of the global population stuff which may be true so for example breast cancer may be more common than testicular cancer but at the end of the day that doesn't change the experience of the person in with testicular cancer and just because some of the statistics cited in this paper which will also interpret right so that's really important may suggest that things are harder for men and i think that that's probably to a certain degree true in this particular dimension it in no way translates into invalidating like the difficulty that women have on dating apps and this is sort of what we're learning as a society as a whole which is that men and women and non-binary people are trans people by virtue of our genders we tend to experience life in a more in a different way right and that just because a particular gender has difficulty in a particular realm does not mean that that gender has it easy in all kinds of realms or that it's more beneficial on a whole to be that gender now some people may make those arguments and there may be statistics to kind of back that up but in my overwhelming experience as a clinician like the key thing to remember is first of all different genders have different experiences of things in life and that each gender no matter whether you're a man a woman trans non-binary whatever is going to face unique challenges and our goal here is to understand the world understand ourselves and help people and as in part of that process what we have to do is acknowledge the individual challenges that a particular demographic may face that in no way invalidates the experience or should be compared to the experience of other people i just don't think that's useful right so if someone ends up with testicular cancer you don't want to say well screw you because way more people have breast cancer now on the flip side there may be unequal treatment which is sort of appropriate there which is like okay so for example if breast cancer is way more common than testicular cancer do we want to mandate mass i mean um not mastectomies um mammograms for mastectomies would be terrible mandating mammograms for women over the age of 50 whereas we don't necessarily need to take an you know an x-ray of people's scrotums once they're over 50 years old so by virtue of the difference in size of a problem we may need to sort of individually create tailored solutions which sort of makes sense medically right so we sort of treat genders somewhat differently and that's based on data but at the end of the day what i would really hope happens from this talk is anything that we're going to say about acknowledging men's difficulties does not necessarily relate to anything that is happening with women's difficulties and that actually by comparing those two things i think we're actually doing a disservice to everyone because just because there are more men on dating apps the challenges that women face on dating apps is different right so there's a lot more research that shows that women are more likely to experience sexual harassment sexual assault than men on by virtue of online dating and things like that so so each gender is going to have its own individual problems and what we're trying to really do is understand what are the problems that affect this particular gender in this particular moment and what can we do about it and then we can also do that for other genders and other situations and other demographics does that make sense are we okay with me continuing to talk about this or is it not acceptable to talk about challenges that men face in the dating realm unless we are at the same time talking about the challenges that women face or making it comparative in nature because here's the thing gender dynamics is not a competition right like things are hard for men and things are hard for women some of the things that are hard for men and women are actually the same but some of them shockingly are different and so if we really want to try to help people we have to acknowledge what those differences are and address them individually does that make sense it's not a competition all right do you need our you're damn right i need your permission so your people are asking do you need our permission yeah i i want it's not so much about permission as it is approval right so this is where like if y'all are not comfortable with continuing this conversation if this is not a conversation that we should move forward in then we can stop got it okay and by the way if people think that i'm overstepping or misplaying or anything like that please let us know because all of that feedback has actually been instrumental in getting us to this point and helping us gain this nuanced understanding okay let's go so let's take a quick look at the article so younger and middle-aged men are the loneliest they've ever been in generations and it's probably going to get worse this is not my typical rosy view of relationships but a reality nonetheless over the last 30 years men have become a larger portion of that growing group of long-term single people and while you don't actually need to be in a relationship to be happy men are typically are happier and healthier when partnered here are the three broad trends in the relation relationship landscape that suggests heterosexual men are in for a rough road ahead dating apps whether you're just starting to date or you're recently divorced and dating again dating apps are a huge driver for new romantic connections in the u.s the only problem is that upwards of 62 percent of users are men and many women are overwhelmed with how many up options and many women are overwhelmed with how many options they have competition in online dating is fierce and lucky in person chance encounters with dreamy partners are rarer than ever so let's stop for a second and try to look at this a little bit critically so the first thing to understand is that this piece so let's let me ask you all a question is this piece fact or is it opinion what do you all think right so this these statements right so so it's interesting so there's a lot of there's a lot of confusion so some people are saying fact and some people are saying opinion so i think this is a prime example of like what to be careful of when you read an article on something like psychology today i have no doubt that greg matos psy d is a very knowledgeable it looks like he's a like specializes in relationship therapy so i have no doubt that he's very confident but a lot of this stuff is opinion so for example this is why it's important to read things critically so 62 of users or men so what is the source of this it's an article from time magazine so according to a new study which then goes to over here so the source is actually just another news article i couldn't even get access to the primary study the other interesting thing is that this source is from 2015. so here we are in 2022 citing a statistic that says that 62 of users are men that this statistic is seven years old so do you all think that's still valid right and like i can't even find the actual article like i can't find the actual source this comes from this is a time magazine article this is not peer-reviewed research now i'm not saying that the person's premise isn't correct and he does cite better research elsewhere my point is that we just need to be critical of what we read okay so and this is where competition and online dating is fierce and lucky in person chance encounters are rarer than ever many women are overwhelmed with how many options they have so this is the kind of statement that i don't know if this is true right so they cite this statistic but where are they getting this idea right so this is where like we've got to be a little bit careful because oftentimes what happens is when you have an article like this people will make statements like this that are very triggering so if you're a woman reading this and you're like i'm not overwhelmed with how many options i have that's not my problem at all this person has no idea what they're talking about and if you're a dude you're like yeah you're damn right like i can't get a single match and all these women on dating apps have like thousands and thousands and thousands and thousands of matches and they must be overwhelmed oh are you what's wrong like you're so overwhelmed with the thousands of matches that you're getting so these kinds of statements create emotional reactions and what we're seeing on the internet is that these are the kinds of like statements that people deeply resonate with or find quite inflammatory right i i don't think that this person is like in in the wrong for saying things like this because we'll get to where they get this in a second okay so but we just need to be critical about it right so this is this person's opinion the person is absolutely allowed to have an opinion and if that's this person's experience that's actually totally fair we just need to be critical with how we're reading it with so many options it's not surprising that women are increasingly selective i do a live tick tock show a better love project and speak with hundreds of audience members every week i hear recurring dating themes themes from women between the ages of 25 and 45. they prefer men who are emotionally available good communicators and share similar values so let's think about this for a second so i'm getting the sense that this person's perspective on women is coming from a live tick tock show where they discuss things with audience members right so this once again it's useful perspective to have right it's in fact the same perspective that we often use which is that we like to talk to people directly in our community and try to you know sort of get individual perspectives anecdotal evidence the difference is that we also i mean maybe this person does too so who knows but that's also why we have a robust research arm at healthy gamer right so we have five or six irb approved studies that we're running because we actually don't know when we interview someone on stream or do a call and show or respond to a post is this actually representative of the community that's why you do research but this is this person's perspective totally fine so they're sort of pointing out that that what we sort of find is that there are men who you know women want men who are emotionally available good communicators and share similar values and then the article goes on to say for men this means a relationship skills gap if not addressed will likely lead to fewer dating opportunities less patience for poor communication skills longer periods of being single et cetera et cetera the problem for men is that emotional connection is the lifeblood of a long healthy term relationship they also talk a little bit about uh you know they're a little bit hopeful right so while there's no chance of stemming the rising tide of unintentional single men there is good news algorithms are becoming increasingly more complex on dating apps and other online platforms hinge apparently has a beta trial that 90 of their users liked their first date um how can men reap the benefit of the algorithms level up your mental health game that means getting into some individual therapy to address your skills gap it means valuing your internal world and respecting your ideas it means seeing intimacy romance emotional connection is worthy of your time and effort ultimately we have an opportunity to revolutionize romantic relationships um and establish healthy norms starting with a first date it's likely that some of these experience romances will be transformative in healing disrupting generational trauma and establishing a fresh culture of admiration validation sounds fantastic men have a key role in this transformation but only if they go all in it's going to take that kind of commitment to themselves to their own mental health into the kind of love that they want to generate in this world will we step up now this also i i think i take a slight issue with this last statement because this implies that the challenges of the rise of single lonely men are predominantly something that they need to fix the question is will we as men step up it doesn't actually address what's kind of interesting which we'll get to which is what these papers actually say about why men are lonely right so these papers as we're going to tunnel down into these papers don't actually say that emotional unavailability is responsible for the the the lack of men in in their ability to date okay that there this person's own citations actually say different things so let's take a quick look at what the papers so these are the papers that this person cited okay let's look at what's going on so loneliness around the world age gender and cultural differences in loneliness the bbc loneliness experiment provided a unique opportunity to examine the differences in the experiences of loneliness across cultures age and gender and interaction between these factors blah blah findings show that loneliness increased with individualism decreased with age and was greater in men than women we also found that age gender and culture interacted to predict loneliness although these those interactions do not qualify the main effects and simply accentuated them we found the most vulnerable to loneliness were younger men living in individualistic cultures now this is really important because what this paper essentially finds is that young men living in individualistic cultures so that's primarily western cultures like the us canada europe right that sort of emphasize an individual mentality over you know the collective so for example maybe parts of east asia south asia southeast asia maybe parts of africa for example these communities are more like uh these cultures are more community driven and so it turns out that you know when this person says oh yeah like younger middle-aged men are the loneliest they've ever been generationally this is correct but we gotta tunnel down a little bit further so as we go down and we look at it let's see what the authors of the paper actually say the finding that loneliness was higher and individualistic compared to collectivist culture should be interpreted with caution the vast majority of participants resided in individually listed countries especially the uk um that does not explain why the effect was stronger for men and younger people okay we propose that there is something about individual in that enhances loneliness particularly if other risk factors are present so that's kind of interesting we found that loneliness was higher among men than women which is contrary to the findings from the ons 2018 survey oh interesting so it seems like in previous research this has not been found to be the case um so that might mean that men need particular conditions to speak about loneliness etc etc you all can read this paper if you want to it's in the public domain so here's another thing to mention as already indicated uh it must also be kept in mind that we used a large non-representative sample of participants who volunteered to speak about their feelings of loneliness finally it is important to acknowledge that the effects we found were very small although consistent across all dimensions we take this to mean that those effects are real and loneliness is a fairly universal experience across demographic categories data also provided by a large sample of individuals found different ages and from a large number of different countries thus providing statistical power the key thing here is that if we actually look at the effect sizes of gender and i'm a little bit rusty on statistics but i think this is a relatively small effect size right so we're talking about uh seven percent to ten i guess 0.07 negative 0.07 to 0.1 is a relatively small effect size so while this paper says it is true that young men from individual cultures are the most lonely group that we've been able to find that number they're not so much more lonely than other people right they are lonelier but not by a whole lot and that's where we've got to be really careful because when someone pairs this kind of statistic right and now we start to see something that's kind of interesting because like this person just uses the word loneliness he doesn't say lonely by a very small margin and then when we see 62 percent of users are men based on research from 2015 we start to construct this idea that lonely like there's an epidemic of large of lonely single men now i do think that this is true but i don't think that the gender dynamic is as disparate as people think it is and that's what the research would say the other really really devastating thing about this that that i was really kind of hesitant on is this person talks about fixing a skill deficit which we're going to talk to you all today a little bit about how to do that because even though i disagree with some of the statistics i think the point that the person says is very good which is that generally speaking women you know may be looking for emotionally available good communicators and that probably correlates with health health and happiness in relationships so we're going to teach y'all a little bit later about how to be emotionally available what does that actually mean right because everyone's like oh like i'm looking for someone who's emotionally available and if you're like if you're listening to that it's like okay how do i do that we're going to teach y'all this is what's kind of interesting so the this person also cites this article which is from the pew research center okay so pew research center is a pretty legitimate research organization but once again not necessarily peer-reviewed scientific publication but the interesting thing is that as you tunnel down into what the the pew research center shows it doesn't talk about you know men being single because of emotional unavailability what it actually talks about is kind of interesting so let me try to find this the growing gap in economic success between partnered and unpartnered adults may have consequences for single men who would eventually like to find a partner in a 2017 pew research center survey 71 of adults said being able to support a family financially is very important for a man to be a good spouse or partner similar shares of men and women said this right so 71 of both men and women or 71 of men and women believe or 71 of adults in an equal share of men and women believe that it's important for a man to be able to financially support a family in contrast 32 percent of adults and just 25 percent of men said this is a very important for a woman to be a good spouse or partner so if you really look at what men and women value in terms of being partnered this is a staggering difference between the genders right a 32 versus 71 percent difference in terms of how important is being able to financially support a family in terms of like for a man versus a woman so what we start to see is like a lot of interesting things right so if you look at uh unpartnered versus partnered adults right so unpartnered adults are 29 of them have completed a bachelor's degree whereas 41 of partnered adults have a bachelor's degree we start to see a difference between our employed um 75 versus 82 percent right 35 000 median income versus 49 000 median income that's pretty wild we're talking about a 40 increase in income that results in being partnered uh there's also interesting things like living at home right so um the the percentage of partnered people who live at home so if you're in a relationship two percent of people live at home whereas if you're not in a relationship 28 of people are living at home so as this table kind of goes down what we start to see is that men who are unpartnered 73 of them are employed whereas 91 percent of them who have partner of employed uh partnered men are employed whereas if you look at the gap for women 74 versus 77 this implies that employment is a far greater aspect for men in relationships than women right now now i'm not saying that this is universally true we're just looking at statistics critically because the really interesting thing here is that this paper that this person cites over here to support his argument that men are lonely doesn't actually have anything to do with emotional availability right this you know like a percentage of people that are financially vulnerable men the partnered men 13 percent for as unpartnered men 36 whereas women tends to be like pretty even okay so the point here is that as we're looking at this we have to be kind of critical because what the data actually suggests is that if you look at men versus women and people who are partnered and unpartnered according to this one pew research survey right what it seems to imply is that economic stability in terms of a man for a man leads to a far greater impact on their relationship success than a woman now if you're a woman who's out there in the audience and you're saying if you take issue with that like that's totally fine you're allowed to take issue with it you're allowed to be critical of it i'm not saying that this is truth this is just one pew research survey which sort of demonstrates this the reason that we're bringing it up is because if you're reading an article like this and it says be more emotionally available we've got to be kind of careful about where that direction is coming from so i do think it's very important for men to become more emotionally available like i think that's like really really important we're going to talk about that in a second but let's just be a little bit clear about you know is there a rise of lonely single men sure but it's not like you know it's not as catastro i mean it's not as imbalanced according to the sources we looked at today that we're looking at a relatively small effect size and for men as compared to women we also are living in a society where i think part of the reason that men really struggle to find relationships is because as we've started to see an improvement in equality in the workplace we have not seen a similar cultural shift right so for example there's still like a lot of you know lack of equality in the workplace like 17 to 21 of people who graduate with engineering degrees are women right so it's still like an 80 dominated field but we're seeing some progress in some areas so now for example 52 to 55 percent of medical students are women as opposed to men right so we're seeing evening out in some fields a lack of evening out in other fields i've seen tons and tons of stories about misogyny in like video game development and things like that so i'm not saying that everything is hunky-dory for women in the workplace but what we are seeing is that it appears that both men and women are likely to judge a man more harshly for a lack of employment than a woman right so that's what the research sort of suggests now let's take a moment to like understand why this narrative that single lonely men gets attacked so i think sometimes what happens is when people are lonely they start to become a little bit toxic right so there's a community of men who's sort of like super into the toxic masculinity is quite misogynistic and so what we tend to see is that you're lonely you sort of there's all of these like men out there that are sort of engaged in this kind of like toxic masculinity approach or mice let's forget about toxic masculine let's just call it misogyny and then what tends to happen what i've observed is that as people respond to the misogyny right both men and women who are like hey stop being an [ __ ] what it actually does is as you attack the misogyny what you're sort of doing is that you're you're kind of disregarding the loneliness at the root which sort of makes sense right so if i'm lonely and i start to become an [ __ ] and people like don't like that i'm being an [ __ ] and criticize me for being an [ __ ] et cetera et cetera et cetera that sort of makes sense and what it actually does is bypasses the fact that i'm lonely to begin with so it's almost like what what's happening is we're getting an invalidation of lonely men because as lonely men gravitate towards polarizing figures that are misogynistic and remember this is the internet so the more inflammatory your perspective the more likely it's it's to be upvoted so there's like this rise of misogyny there's a devaluation of the misogyny and in the devaluation of the misogyny what you're having with it is a devaluation of the underlying loneliness right does that make sense because it's hard to say when someone is being like cruel and and sexist that oh yeah like you're suffering too like your your your underlying points are valid because all we do is respond to that toxicity at the top and so this is something that's i think really really devastating because what's happening is that in an effort to try to support these lonely men what we're actually doing is adopting views that are very justifiably criticized but in justifiably criticizing those particular views we're actually invalidating the core of the problem and this is what's so hard about it is if i'm a lonely single man and there's a crowd of people who are invalidating a select group of misogynistic people who are like you know promoting connection in their own way right or getting laid or whatever right like what we're sort of doing is we're losing sight of the fact that the people that resonate with those communities are lonely to begin with and that that's a real problem do you all get that like it's nuanced like the complaints i think are valid it's the adaptation to the complaint which is also justifiably criticized but but the root of the loneliness is absolutely there and i do think that this is a real problem right so this is not like a just because research suggests that you know the discrepancy between men and women is not that big that's irrelevant like it's not a competition right if they're me lonely men and lonely women we should address both of those things and saying that oh it's not like men are much more lonely than women doesn't actually help because there's still a gigantic pile of lonely men you can't invalidate just because i've got testicular cancer and someone else has breast cancer doesn't mean oh you've got testicular cancer this person has breast cancer so screw everybody no both of these people need help right like loneliness is a problem for each gender and the reasons for the loneliness can be specific and gender specific and there are for example like differential experiences with dating apps and even though the the time article said in 2015 you know it's dated but they cited that 14 percent of women swipe right versus 46 percent of men swipe right right and if that's true that's a staggering difference in terms of dating behavior and will probably be affecting men and women differently now why do women swipe right on 14 of time who knows maybe does it have to do with employment does that have to do with media and income does it have to do with emotional availability like who knows and just because women are more like or more selective on dating apps than men doesn't mean that women have it easy on dating apps y'all get that like you can have an advantage as a gender but that doesn't mean that like on the blanket that everything is easy for you because most of the time when i hear about complaints around dick pics inappropriate sexual behavior things like that right it's like the women who are complaining so it's not like they have it easy and this is what we've got to be really careful about is if we want to try to help people we can't invalidate someone's perspective just because we're suffering it's not a competition and it's not like the amount of help to go around is limited what limits it is our own perspective what limits the amount of help is like the compassion that we give or don't give when someone else says i'm struggling now let's talk for a second about so just to kind of summarize you know i think this is a good article i think it's an opinion and it's important to remember that this is opinion if you find it inflammatory or if you find it validating both are reasonable perspectives as we tunnel down into the research i think the story that they sort of end up telling is very different from what the research actually suggests that's important to remember is there a rise of single lonely men yes is the most vulnerable population for loneliness in today's world young men from individual cultures that is also a factual statement turns out that the size is not that big the discrepancy is actually not that big but the reasons for the partner versus unpartnered right the reasons to be in a relationship do seem to be heavily influenced by gender so i think we live in a world where despite an improvement in equality between men and women there is a lag of social acceptance for employment and financial related issues for men now this is where like you know the a lot of the the pro-men kind of people will talk about oh like all you got to do is make money and grind and all this kind of stuff and that's all women care about i think that's a simplistic view right i don't think that that's the case and and anyone who kind of says oh oh if you want to attract a man all you need to do is this if you want to attract a woman all you need to do is this has no idea that like i don't know if you'll get this but men and women are human beings that have individual preferences and some women don't care about how much their partner makes and some women do some men do care about how much their partner makes and some men don't i know it's shocking but the behaviors of a gender cannot be reduced to a gender and there's individual variation like i know this is kind of weird as well but there are actually some men who don't even want to sleep with women can you all believe that and there are some women who are actually not interested in dating a man no matter how much money they have right like there are individual variances amongst people and so we've got to remember that now let's move on to one last thing from the article i know it's it's bizarre it's bizarre you know wait till some of those you know some of the the pickup artist crew figures that out they're gonna be shocked all right so let's talk about emotional availability for a second so like if you're in this situation and i think the article is decent right so it's psychology today so you know it's going to be an opinion piece that's written by someone who's got a bunch of experience cites a couple of statistics and then sort of concludes that men need to rise up and step up to the challenge of emotional availability i don't quite agree with that because i think a lot of this is societal right so i think that as you look if 71 of people think that men need to have you know be able to financially support a job versus 32 percent of women i mean financially support a family versus 32 percent of women believe that you know a woman should financially support a family and the economy is getting worse we're getting you know wage stagnation we're sort of seeing more inflation more people are living at home and things like that those economic forces i think are adversely affecting men more so than women in terms of a dating world okay that too if you disagree with you're more than welcome to disagree with it i haven't done a thorough like literature search on it i'm just using the sources that were cited in the article to come to that conclusion and hopefully i think that's a pretty fair conclusion right so according to pew research we see different things in men and women in terms of income and stuff so as like financially the world gets harder it's affecting men disproportionately to women so in terms of dating now once again that doesn't mean that things are easy for women in this current world because there are going to be other things that are going on today for example the ease of which you can get doxxed and get stalked and things like that that i think are disproportionately affecting women right so society is changing and each gender is getting screwed in different ways and trying to like compete about it is like not worth our time so what does it mean to be emotionally available so this is where we we've been trying to figure out what is the mechanism through which coaching works so we tend to see is that when people come into coaching they form better relationships they actually do better professionally um you know they they start to form healthier boundaries and things like that so like they form better relationships with family members they even will start to date form better relationships with things like roommates and romantic partners and stuff like that your mileage may vary but we've seen this general trend so we were trying to figure out okay how does this happen and what we sort of settled on was this concept of emotional quotient or eq so when we talk about emotional availability i think a really good way to think about this is is having a low eq versus a high eq and the components of eq are things like awareness of what you are feeling another thing is the ability to self-regulate what you are feeling a third thing is being able to communicate what you are feeling a fourth thing is to be able to set aside what you are feeling in an effort in in the ability to be empathic to someone else and the fifth thing is an understanding of how your emotions influence your behaviors okay so i'm going to share a story with y'all so a couple years ago i had a client who was sort of in this situation where they had this surprise set up for valentine's day for their significant other they were going to take them to a particular like cool place in town they'd made reservations and stuff like that right so and it turns out that a couple weeks before because it was like the hot you know happened in a new place so a couple weeks before turns out that their significant other is out with their friends and they spontaneously decide to go to that same location so in in the client's mind like they had sort of set everything up to have this like magical valentine's day experience and their partner goes and like goes there and checks it out kind of on their own with other friends they're also like so there's a client is male their significant other is female and so they're also like men in the group and things like that so this is the kind of situation where this person has invested a lot of time and energy to create a wonderful surprise for their partner and their partner goes and ruins it okay ruins it by going on their own and now this person really struggles because like did their partner actually do anything wrong no not at all like they were out with their friends they decided to go hit up that place and it's like the other thing is like it's a surprise right like so it's not like the partner knew like if they had told them hey by the way i made reservations i think it's going to be like awesome i want to like celebrate this like new opening with you on valentine's day it's not like they communicated they're trying to make it a surprise and so this person felt really resentful right like oh my god like you took this like or this beautiful night is now ruined but you can't really criticize the partner for it because the partner really didn't know right like so she wasn't really doing anything wrong and it's still ruined so what do you do in that situation so you can't criticize them because you know they didn't do anything wrong so but that feeling of resentment and stuff like that starts to come out in a lot of passive aggressive behavior did you have fun yeah it was great are you upset about something no i'm not upset forget it we don't need to hang out this weekend i i gotta i gotta study i've got a final coming up why don't you make other plans for valentine's day and then like the esso is like wait what's going like i'm confused or did i do something wrong no you didn't do anything wrong right so what does this mean let's look at it awareness of the emotion does this person have awareness of emotion no sort of right they understand that they feel resentful kind of can they communicate it like they don't really even know what to communicate because it feels so stupid to them so they're not able to regulate that emotion because it's like i you ruined it even though i can't fault you for it but you still ruined it right and so like because you know the criticism isn't fair and so that you're unable to self-regulate you're not really aware of what you're feeling you certainly can't communicate it right because you don't know what you're feeling and it feels so petty it feels so damn petty and then what happens is you're not aware of how your emotions shape your behavior so you know you're angry with them but you can't be kind of like mature about it right so like you start playing this passive-aggressive kind of game and then your partner is really confused about it you can't really communicate with them so this is an example of what being emotionally unavailable means so another good example of this that sometimes is is more common in men than women is um problem solving versus listening so often times these are like general kind of accepted things i actually haven't seen a bunch of great research especially recently about this stuff so i think some of this stuff may be dated but you know there's this impression that men are more problem-solving and women are more like supportive when dealing with problems okay so like and i don't care if men are more this way or women or more that way it doesn't really matter what matters is that for you to understand that if you're in a relationship what does it mean to be emotionally available it's to ask yourself when your partner comes to you with a problem something that is not going well in their life for you to stop for a second and think about what is this person looking for are they looking for help in solutions or are they looking to vent and oftentimes a big mistake that a lot of people will make is that they'll try to provide solutions when someone really just wants to vent right it's like you know oh man like my place is such a mess you know it's like there's like i don't even know where to start and it's like okay here let's get a piece of paper i set an alarm for sunday at 9 00 a.m and let's make a list of things for you to clean clean this first take out the trash sort through your mail do this do this do this do this and like the person knows how to do that they're just you know it's like wow yeah that sucks you ever get to the point where in cleaning where you're like i don't need to clean yet i don't need to clean yet i don't need to clean yet and then suddenly there's too much to clean right those responses are very different y'all get that so i do think emotional availability is important is it arguably more important for men sure so there's older research that suggests that you know men are raised in a particular way that they learn to manage their emotions differently are women looking for emotionally available men i i assume so i think that men are also looking for emotionally available women and what are we basing that on we're basing that on what people say when they call in to a tick-tock show about dating right but this is the other thing sometimes we'll people will say things when they call into shows that are actually different from what they're at what they're actually looking for so when it comes to for example like dating research it seems like what you know what leads to more success is a better median income a college degree being able to live and support a fine you know family and things like that so at the end of the day though you know i think that becoming more emotionally available is like really fantastic for men women and everyone involved like eq improvement is good for all human beings do men need some more improvement on that maybe need some instruction on that more so than women maybe so that's why what we're sort of talking about is okay what is emotional availability it comes down to a couple of things first is awareness of your emotions second thing is the ability to regulate your emotions the ability to communicate your emotions the ability to set aside your emotions for the sake of empathy right and try to understand the other person's perspective or feel what the other person is feeling and the last is to be aware of how your emotions influence your behavior does that make sense so hopefully this was an acceptable foray into the rise of lonely young men do i think it's a problem yeah do i think that men young men from individualistic cultures are the most at risk group for loneliness sure and it turns out that we've got to be a little bit careful because i don't think they're lonely just because they don't know how to be emotionally available i think if you look at the research there's a lot of very real demographic and worldly factors that are contributing to this including what people are looking for in terms of a mate and also how the world makes it hard to be those things because of very real economic forces and does emotional availability play into it absolutely but i think we've got to be very very careful about assuming that the responsibility lies solely with men right so anytime we're looking at gender dynamics we want to be careful about you know whatever the gender is and whatever we're talking about if we're talking about equal representation at the c-suite level is this a societal problem or is this something that women need to step up right i don't think it's fair to say that women need to step up in general i don't think it's fair to say that a whole demographic needs to step up because i think generally speaking people try pretty hard right i don't think that like telling a gender or a race to step up like is fair like indian people need to step up white people need to step up black people need to step up i don't i don't think that that's fair at all so do men have some responsibility in it a hundred percent do they have a lot of responsibility in it a hundred percent so should you become more emotionally available absolutely should you boost your eq absolutely will it improve your dating life in your professional life absolutely and at the same time we need to acknowledge that this is not all on the shoulders of the individual right as human beings you can't blame an individual for a systemic issue and the truth of the matter is when it comes to something as complex as dating i don't think it's an individual issue or a systemic issue and it's just as devastating for men or women or whoever else to say oh this is a society thing there's nothing i can do let me throw out my hands oh it's like i'm screwed by society screwed by society and absolve yourself of all responsibility and not try to actually improve yourself the truth of the matter is that it's somewhere in between right so this is what we learned from like tons of research in the field of medicine things are multi-factorial bringing your cholesterol down is that because your doctor isn't good enough or because you're not exercising the answer is it's a little bit of both right there's shared responsibility and what i'm seeing more and more in gender dynamics and especially with things like dating and and stuff like that is that there's no shared responsibility everyone's always trying to punt the responsibility to everyone else so men are trying to punt the responsibility to society and society is trying to punt the responsibility to men it's all your fault you need to grow up you need to step up and on the flip side there are people on the other extreme it's like oh like there's nothing i can do and i think that's exactly why the problem persists do you all get that like that's in situations where people share responsibility and like we as a society say we need to do more to support men and as men say hey we need to do more to grow as individuals that's when the problem is going to get fixed but right now all that's doing is we're passing the buck back and forth and that's why the problem is getting worse chat wants to know how to boost eq i wish it were so easy so let me kind of counter that question so how do you boost iq right so it's like the interesting thing about human stuff human behavior human attributes is the more global the attribute the harder it is to operationalize how to improvement right so how do you become more compassionate it's challenging so that's why we started by breaking things down into the five components of eq right so do you are you aware of what you're feeling can you regulate what you're feeling do you [Music] can you communicate what you're feeling can you set aside what you're feeling are you aware of how your emotions influence your behaviors those are the five big domains of eq so we do believe that coaching will help with something like that i imagine therapy will help with something like that although interestingly enough the eq research is predominantly not from the field of psychotherapy or medicine a lot of the eq research actually comes from the field of like business and like management and things like that so that's it's really interesting um but i think like that's where those are the five steps um what do you have to say about eq not really being real as far as it not being a scientific term but one coined by a journalist who wrote a book in the late 90s early 2000s i think it's a valid perspective so that's where as you look at the how the research has progressed people took the term eq and they tried to figure out okay is this a real thing that maps onto something that is scientific and measurable and in that research which once again remember comes out of management and stuff so that stuff is like a little bit different right so it's what we've actually found is that there are domains of eq which are scientifically valid so awareness of emotions is absolutely a scientifically real thing the ability to regulate your emotions is absolutely a real scientific thing the ability to be empathic is absolutely a real scientific thing so i think the cool thing about eq research is that it may have been coined by a journalist in the business types right and i already said that most of it actually doesn't come from science it comes from the business world and then what's happened over the last 20 years is that scientists as more and more people have been looking at it they've been trying to figure out okay what part of eq is actually real and not real and that's why when we talk about eq and emotional availability what we try to do is share with you all the scientifically valid versions of eq which are the sub domains it's a it's a good does that sort of make sense so like a journalist may have stumbled upon it and then people thought oh this is kind of interesting and they started doing management trainings and things like that and it seemed to help and then researchers got curious and they're like wait a minute but what is this is it real and then they tunnel down into it and this these are the discoveries that they made that i personally think are valid which is why we share it this way you
