today we're going to show you how to teach your body that stress is designed for life or death situations and not doing simple stuff like opening emails [Music] so let's start by understanding what our stress system was designed for so if you look at the animal kingdom through which we evolve like our stress system is designed for short term life or death situations so if we're like human beings in a jungle and we see a tiger that's what our stress system is designed for you can look at things like deer or Impala or even mice or snakes and all of these organisms have stress systems and they're designed for sort of immediate and severe threats the problem if you call it a problem it's kind of not really a problem right I think it's a win for the human race most of the time in society today we're not faced with life or death situations right like we're not we're pretty secure like we've got a place to sleep hopefully we have food and stuff like that and so what we tend to see is that our stress system is inappropriately activated the kinds of stress that we deal with today are more long-term so on the first of the month I'm already thinking about how am I going to pay my rent at the end of the month how am I going to find a job how am I going to find a partner what's going to happen with climate change what's going to happen with inflation so the stressors that we face today are more chronic and long-term and the problem is that our body has one system to deal with stress and that system is designed for short-term stress so in a weird way our body inappropriately activates our stress system to deal with these problems and this creates an even bigger issue so if you're stressed out you're probably sort of in this cycle of like okay I'm feeling stressed I'm feeling overwhelmed let me engage in avoidance behaviors to make the stress go away so I'm going to distract myself or things like that and then as I distract myself and engage in avoidance the problems that are causing me stress don't actually go away and so as those problems build up and build up and build up I start to feel even more overwhelmed and more stressed out and so the problems tend to pile up and then eventually you cross this very important threshold where your stress outweighs your feeling of overwhelming and then like at the last second you procrastinate to the last minute and then in a burst of stress driven activity you do something about your problem if you're ready to take the next step on your mental health Journey check out Dr K's guide it's an immersive resource that distills over 20 years of my experience laid out in a way that is tailored to your needs so if you're ready to better understand your mind and take control of it check out the link in the description below but your performance in that point isn't very good right you're kind of exhausted you're sort of stressed out you're doing everything all at once everything is rushed and then you end up kind of doing a crappy job anyway and then you beat yourself up and then the cycle just repeats itself so today we're going to teach y'all how to Short Circuit that entire process how to really understand how stress works so that you can optimally solve your problems so let's start by understanding how our body keeps stress in check so normally let's say I'm walking through the jungle and I see a tiger I start to run there's a burst of crh and then ACTH and then that leads to cortisol adrenaline gets activated as all these systems get activated I also have a physical component so since I'm running my heart starts beating really fast my blood pressure increases and then something really really interesting happens as all of these things activate and I start running away what I actually my body detects all of these things so there are these things called your carotid baroreceptors which are blood pressure sensors in your neck and this is kind of interesting you know in like in movies and stuff when there's like a ninja and they like choke someone out they're not actually cutting off their oxygen flow what they're actually doing is squeezing on both sides of your carotid Barrel receptors and this is what's really interesting when they squeeze on both sides of the Carotid Barrel receptors our body thinks oh my God the blood pressure is way too high our blood pressure is huge right because you're squeezing on those parts so it increases the pressure and as we increase the pressure there it actually causes our heart rate to slow down and our blood pressure to drop which causes people to pass out in the movies but if we sort of stop and think about that what we actually discover is this is the natural way that our body compensates with a high stress situation when our blood pressure goes up and our heart rate goes up our body recruits other things to slow our heart rate down to decrease our blood pressure and to stop the production of cortisol now the problem in today's world is that when we feel stressed out there is not that physical component right so we get cortisol release but we don't actually increase our heart rate we don't increase our blood pressure we don't start hyperventilating because we're not physically running away from it everything the other thing that happens when we physically run away from things is that we release endorphins and endorphins will help us literally relax so basically what happens in the natural world and through millions of years of evolution is any time my body gets stressed it automatically starts Parts the circuitry to de-stress endorphins parasympathetic nervous system activation and you'll kind of understand this if you go for a very brisk run like if you exercise a lot what does your body want to do afterward it wants to do absolutely nothing I'm going to sit down I need to relax you don't feel like doing anything you're not even mentally stressed you're just kind of vegging out and so this is the really interesting thing our stress system today does not recruit any of those things because we feel this chronic stress with no homeostatic activation there's no balancing of the stress response in today's world so interestingly enough if we want to actually de-stress what we need to do is recruit those systems so if you're feeling super stressed out about something what you need to do is the most vigorous exercise you can do for as short of a time period is you can kind of tolerate so we're not talking about 20 minutes a day we're not talking about wake up every day and exercise what we're talking about is literally if you are feeling stressed out try to run as if something a monster is chasing you and your life depends on it run as hard as you can for a short of a time period as you can like you don't have to run for a long time you could literally do a dead ass Sprint for like 90 seconds and if you you feel absolutely exhausted and you can't run 91 seconds then you're doing it right now this is the really interesting thing a lot of people may say does this mean that I need to exercise no so this is what's really cool so if you run it 50 of Your Capacity you do not shut off your stress system if you run it 70 of Your Capacity you shut off your stress system more if you run it 90 or 100 of your capacity that recruits the greatest shut off of your stress system so think about it very simply right so the more the harder you exercise and the more difficult your exercise is the more that it stresses your body the more that it stresses your body the more that your body has to compensate as soon as the stress ends to even release more and more endorphins and calm you down even more so the beautiful thing about this technique is that if you are not in shape if you are not used to exercising you will actually get a greater stress reduction than some someone who is in shape and the really cool thing about that is that once we shut off our stress system then something beautiful happens once we're no longer stressed out and our CRA a CRF level drops then you will stop engaging in avoidance behaviors your cravings for avoidance will literally go shut down or decrease because our body is using endorphins to shut off CRF production once we shut off CRF production our desire for Cravings distraction and avoidance actually decreases which then allows you makes it more easier to actually do the task that is stressing you out in the first place so if you're in a situation where the thought of opening up your email triggers a stress response or sending a message to someone or needing to cancel social plans if you're stressed out about that engage in as vigorous exercises you can for as long as you can it doesn't have to be long and then you'll start to slow down you'll start to stop avoiding things and and then you'll actually be able to focus on the task at hand and do something about it and the Beautiful Thing is as you do things about it your overall Global stress will start to get better because you have fewer things to be stressed out about so the problem in today's society is that our stress system gets inappropriately activated by mental tasks but our stress system is actually designed for physical survival and the beautiful thing is that the stress system has a built-in off switch the problem is the stresses that we feel deal with today don't actually shut off the off switch even if you think about completing the task what does that do to your stress level it's sort of a relief but you don't actually feel fully relaxed afterward and why is that it's because when you complete the mental task you're not recruiting the endorphin system you're not recruiting your parasympathetic nervous system you're not actually shutting off CRF production so as soon as we're done with our task what do we go back into we give in the Cravings so if you want to master your stress in today's society you've got to recruit your stress system in the right way so hopefully this is helpful give this a shot and kind of let us know does this work for you not work for you we'd love to hear from you so go
