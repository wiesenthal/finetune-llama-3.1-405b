because intellect does not have anything to do with motivation you can logically know that you should get out of bed at 7am every morning exercise for an hour eat a bowl of oatmeal and then do intermittent fasting for the next 16 hours like you can intellectually know that so if we think about what EQ is it is the ability to recognize and become aware of what your internal emotional state is to be able to communicate that internal emotional state to be able to regulate that internal emotional state and most importantly to not let that internal emotional state impact your behavior so Tech teller and our mods in our community folks have put together yet another epic Community event and I really really really like this one so this one is called right in the fields and so for the next six weeks what we're going to be doing is learning about and talking about emotions so it's our belief that the mechanism of change that we create in this community is actually through EQ or emotional quotient so many years ago someone realized that there's a general intellectual or analytical capability which IQ which sort of governs your ability to like problem solve stuff and so we did a bunch of studying on IQ which is essentially a reasoning capabilities our analytical capabilities and what we discovered was that you know there's this thing called IQ and that it determines how successful or unsuccessful you are in some ways because oftentimes people with IQ run into problems and we'll get into that in a second so many many years later we sort of discovered hey there's like a whole portion of the brain that is not related to IQ which influences things like motivation and behavior because intellect does not have anything to do with motivation you can logically know that you should get out of bed at 7am every morning exercise for an hour eat a bowl of oatmeal and then do intermittent fasting for the next 16 hours like you can intellectually know that and so what we sort of discovered over the last 30 years is that intellect is insufficient at making people successful and we see those people oftentimes in our communities are people who are very very smart but like can't live up to their potential and so as researchers we're kind of looking into this what they discovered is is what we now call EQ so if we think about what EQ is it is the ability to recognize and become aware of what your internal emotional state is to be able to communicate that internal emotional state to be able to regulate that internal emotional state and most importantly to not let that internal emotional state impact your behavior so what we tend to see when people are emotionally numb so we'll use terms like alexithymia or things like that there's also Neuroscience research on addiction that shows that people who are vulnerable to addiction are more unaware of their internal emotional state so a good example of this is when I work with patients they'll say yeah everything was going great for a year and then I don't know what happened I relapsed and the more that I work with people like that and the more that we talk about it what we discover is that there was stressor after stressor after stressor it wasn't actually RNG it was there's stuff piling up that the person was unaware of and so as we become unaware of our emotions they start to bleed into other parts of our life so they can manifest as like all kinds of different things like they can Manifest this jealousy but we don't even realize it right we're kind of like yeah I don't want to go there why I don't know it's just not for me so we use a lot of this vague language that actually like controls our life yeah I'm just not a gym person yeah like that's just not for me so we'll like use all this vague language but it's actually emotional unawareness and what we've actually discovered is that by gaining awareness of our emotions then we start to get to regulate them right and so what happened with me I was completely emotionally unaware and so I would wake up every day and I would be like yeah I don't feel like going to class let me start playing video games and I play video games for 14 hours 16 hours and then I'd pass out and like I didn't realize that I was avoiding I was afraid I was ashamed and that all of these emotions are controlling my life Not only was I not aware of them I didn't know how to regulate them and I certainly couldn't keep them from controlling me so those are the different EQ domains that that have kind of been discovered and that we sort of work on we also measure outcomes in our coaching program for example in terms of EQ and so over the next six weeks what we're going to try to do is just equip you all with like information and knowledge and understanding of emotions now this is a Community Driven event which means that it's not just streams and like Dr K lecturing about stuff there's going to be that too so we've got a lot of really good emotional topics um like talking about emotional availability in relationships and and things like that but also like really fundamental stuff like why do we have emotions but the really cool thing is that listening to lectures about emotions doesn't necessarily boost your EQ what we're hoping for is that there's a bunch of stuff that we're going to do on our Discord and things that y'all can get involved in in a community kind of way so I'm going to just share some of that stuff with you right now okay so um there's what we're going to ask people to do is to like do different things like track your emotions write journal entries reflect on your emotions engage in empathy building exercises and do emotional regulation techniques so we're going to Target like all of that stuff in a very Hands-On kind of way um y'all can log on to feels.healthygamer.gg to participate uh journal entries by the way are completely anonymous and then each week also on the Discord we're going to have an ask a coach event about particular emotions so each week we're going to cover emotions like shame fear anger sadness boredom and happiness so we're not going to cover all of them each week but once a week we're going to go through different emotions and if you all have questions and and kind of want to explore that in a more interactive way there's ask a coach um and then we've also got a couple of cool exercises so there's reflection corner where you get shown a previous journal entry and then you reflect on it so like this is where we don't really get taught this stuff right but you can write a journal entry and then reflecting on your journal entry is actually where the money is it's kind of like if I want to get better at a video game I can PL I can grind 20 hours but it's probably better for me to climb if I play 10 hours and then watch my replays for 10 hours right that's when I actually get to see my mistakes and learn and grow so we've got that going on there's also empathy Labs which I think sounds very very cool so that's where we're going to anonymously show a journal entry and then we're gonna try to level up our empathy so as we read a passage what do you imagine that person is feeling right so this is where we like literally like if you think about how do you train empathy well let's take a look at a passage and see if we can figure out what that person might be feeling and then we'll also we're also going to teach you all practical techniques like meditations and other kinds of emotional regulation techniques so I'm super super um excited about this because I think that the more that we're growing the more we're able to do more stuff so it's cool that we've got coaching that's for people who are really willing to make a commitment of time and energy to make a significant change over their life over like let's say a 12-week span that's kind of like for people who are who are very very interested and motivated to make change then we've got people who log into stream or you know watch stream or watch YouTube or whatever participate in some way and it's not like those people aren't interested in making a change too and we've absolutely got something for people who are like ah like I want to learn stuff I want to grow I want to improve but I've got a 45 minute drive each way to work and like that's the time willing the amount of time that I'm willing to devote totally fine we're here for you what we're discovering is that there's something in the middle which is okay I'm not sure that coaching is for me but I want more than just to listen I want to start to like be able to change I want to start journaling I want to start reflecting I want to start acquiring some skills and for that group that's really where I think these community events are really powerful our touchgrass event for example was really fantastic because it was all focused on getting y'all to go out and actually build something in your lives right so go out and meditate go out and pick a piece of fresh fruit you know go for a walk go hiking go look at nature go and do the things that we say you should do and now we're going to really start with with emotions so we're going to dive over the next six weeks I encourage all y'all to kind of tune in for all of this stuff both the lectures that we do on stream the events that we have on Discord and participate in your own way and my hope is that at the end of the six weeks will have seen a significant portion of our community have more emotional awareness more emotional regulation and more control over their lives because their emotions are no longer controlling them that's really the goal and the question is can we actually make a significant statistical impact oh a 10 change is astronomical so wise guy 315 Great point 10 percent change is astronomical so I want you all to think about this so EQ is more like IQ right a 10 change in your IQ is unheard of like things don't boost your IQ by that much that's what's really interesting about it so you don't even need even a 10 improve a 10 Improvement is a huge outcome right so you can think about like there's some situations where 10 Improvement is huge so for I were to say hey this is going to increase your lifespan by 10 that is wild so you all have to remember that when it comes to Scientific measurement some things 10 seem small but is actually gigantic like a 10 Improvement in your income is could be transformative so with this EQ stuff what we tend to see is that that the other thing that's really interesting is that small improvements appear to be correlated with large changes in external life so even a five percent Improvement in EQ for example or like five to ten percent Improvement in EQ is correlated with a 50 plus percent or anywhere between 40 and 60 Improvement in confidence in living your life is that is that is that wild like that's not that's sort of an amalgamation of statistics and stuff that I've read so what's really interesting is a small bump in EQ can be correlated with large changes in other domains foreign
