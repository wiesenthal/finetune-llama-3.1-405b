today we're going to talk a little bit about anxiety and by the end of the lecture I'd love to equip you with some basic understanding of anxiety starting with what is anxiety how does it form how does it manifest in the present and how to approach it the truth of the matter is that anxiety is getting worse at an alarming rate and this video is for three kinds of people the first is it's for people who may have gotten treatment for anxiety but are looking to better understand the problem or kind of improve what they can do about it the second thing is that this is a video for people who may have tried anxiety treatment but found that it didn't really work for them very well and we're going to dive into a little bit about why that could be and the third thing is this is a video for people who just want to understand anxiety who may not need to engage in treatment aren't really interested in it maybe it's not that severe and you just want to understand a little bit about how this stuff works within you hey there thanks for watching and I'm glad these videos have been helpful a lot of times I'll read the comments and see people asking well what do I actually do about it which is a great question and unfortunately the resources out there haven't been that great which is precisely why I started HD in the first place HG coaches are trained on a curriculum that integrates my understanding of what motivates us what paralyzes us and most importantly what leads to Lasting behavioral change if you're ready to take the next step HG coaches can help you build the life that you want they've helped people build careers help people find relationships build networks of friends and even do things like discover their passions or pursue Hobbies so if this sounds like something that you'd be interested in check out the link in the description below so let's start by understanding a little bit about what we know already and also what we've learned recently so the biggest problem that I see today with anxiety is that we view it as a mental condition and there's kind of like a good reason for this right so if we look at our initial explorations of anxiety in the west they were done by people like psychoanalysts so people like Freud and Jung would talk to other people and understood anxiety as a process of the mind and they're not wrong right so based on a lot of the discoveries they made and some of those we'll share with you all today really solid stuff we've developed treatment protocols like cognitive behavioral therapy or psychodynamic therapy that actually statistically improve people's experience of anxiety so that's great it's like kind of a mental thing the challenge though is that a lot of recent research that we've discovered shows that anxiety is not localized to the mind and this sort of like makes sense if you stop and think about it we as human beings are like whole organisms right and our brain exists within our body and even the functions of our mind can be influenced by what's going on in our brain and even be influenced by what's going on in our body so I think one of the reasons that we're seeing anxiety get worse despite the fact that we're spending more money on Research despite the fact that we are training a bunch of therapists despite the fact that we're like investing a lot in brain science and all this kind of stuff like why is anxiety getting worse it's because the professionals that usually deal with anxiety are specialized in the mind right so if you look at a therapist or psychologist chances are they're not a medical doctor but they're someone who's focused entirely on the mind which is not necessarily a bad thing I'm not it's not an indictment to therapist and let's remember that they have effective methods right we have effective methods but their education is lacking in certain major areas that we've actually discovered now contribute to anxiety like the heart and autonomic nervous system and even stuff like brain gut stuff and gut microbiome so we're going to be diving into that so this is why I think even we've had a lot of people in our community who have gone to see therapists and this is what's kind of frustrating right is if someone complains about anxiety on the internet people say go see a therapist and that is a great move don't get me wrong I'm all for it you should absolutely do it if you've never done it before but also that some people don't that doesn't seem to help some people or doesn't help them enough and so that's why we're going to be talking about sort of a start to finish perspective on anxiety so let's start by understanding what anxiety is so anxiety is essentially a heightened Baseline of worry around projected threats so generally speaking our mind and our body has a whole system that is designed to respond to threats okay and this is where like our adrenaline is going to increase our heart rate is going to increase we're going to change we're going to make changes to our gut so there's all kinds of changes that our body and brain and mind are going to make any time we're faced with a stressor so the real challenge with anxiety is that what is a true stress what is an actual stress and what is a perceived stress is messed up so whereas 99 people may think this is something that you don't need to worry about your brain is telling you hey this is a real threat so the first thing to understand about anxiety is it it is a heightened awareness or a heightened emphasis on potential threats and so for a normal person what they may experience is they're not worried about it because the possibility of it happening is like pretty low so I don't need to stress out about stuff that like may not happen right if you struggle with anxiety you're gonna think that that's like absolutely insane you have to think about everything that may not happen because that is how you avoid those negative situations and protect yourself so if that's something you resonate with that is the Crux of anxiety there are real threats that our body responds to brain responds to mind response to and then there are these perceived threats and the problem is that people with anxiety move the perceived threats into the real threat column and so everything feels like a real danger and our body and our brain and our mind respond accordingly and they tell us to freak out so let's understand how that calibration gets messed up so most people with anxiety have some kind of negative experience in childhood that teaches them to be worried so anxiety is a problem in adulthood or maybe adolescence but at its core it's actually a survival strategy or an adaptation so let's kind of put ourselves in the shoes of a five-year-old or a six-year-old right so this is a five-year-old or six-year-old that maybe has an alcoholic parent so how does the five-year-old survive in this situation they have to think about the parent a lot right because what are your tools as a five-year-old can you create physical space are you financially independent can you adjust your diet can you create sort of like boundaries around how you manage your emotions can you use a meditation app to manage your emotions can you effectively communicate using words and theory of mind and empathy to calm people down of course not you can't do any of that all you can do is think how can I survive so when your parent comes home and they're drunk what are all the things that you can think through all the possibilities of how you're going to deal with if they're feeling like this if they're feeling like this if they're feeling like this I gotta clean up my room before they come home so they don't get pissed off right so you start to think and engage in behaviors to try to adapt to the circumstance and so what you learn as a five-year-old and remember this is like the part of our the time where our brain is like learning the fundamentals of how the world works so we're learning things like how does gravity work right so how strong is gravity how are relationships formed how do I deal with challenges and what anxious kids discover is that the way that I deal with challenges is I think about it a lot and I will think about it so I can figure out how to best adapt to it because fundamentally I cannot change the outward problem I just have to think my way to success this is the Crux of how anxiety is born these kids then carry that into adulthood so how do I approach problems do I approach problems through communication do I approach problems through boundary setting no if I have a problem I am going to think through it until I figure out what is the best way to solve it because that's the only thing that works and remember that these five-year-olds this works for them right this is why anxiety is so hard to kick is because when you're five you have no power but what goes on in your head all you the only option you've got is to think through a thousand scenarios and think about how you're going to handle each one and then when your mom or dad comes home that's when you activate some plan but fundamentally you are not in control and so you have to plan for contingencies and this is what happens in the mind of someone who's anxious so now let's bring that person to adulthood what's the strategy that your brain learned when you were learning how to walk and when you were learning how to talk what else did you learn you learned that if there is a problem out there fundamentally I can't fix the problem so what I have to do is deal with it right and the more that I think about it the more effective my strategies will be and this is where people who are anxious will oftentimes invest a ton of energy for even a tiny amount of control or a tiny amount of improvement it's fundamentally not a good trade but it's the only trade that their brain learned how to make so now you're thinking about all these scenarios and you even recognize as an anxious person that thinking about this doesn't help and yet you do it anyway why is that it's because that's what your brain learned how to do when your brain developed this strategy when it learned how to play the game it had the power and abilities of a five-year-old and so that's the only strategy it knows how to do and this is what's so damn confusing about anxiety not only for the person who's experienced anxiety anxiety for for the people around you they're like why don't you just dot dot dot why don't you just talk to your boss why don't you just email your professor and ask him for an extension it's so confusing right and you may be be beating yourself up because all you're doing is thinking about it instead of actually doing anything about it and you're incredibly frustrated by yourself other people are frustrated with you and they make it seem so easy and then you feel terrible about yourself because you're like why can't I do this it's a really good question it's because your brain learned that doing stuff doesn't work your brain learned one survival mechanism which is think it through and adapt to whatever crap comes your way and this also can become a self-fulfilling prophecy because as you do less about it right if you don't email your professor if you don't have a conversation with your boss problems will arise and as problems arise your worst fears become true but now since you've been anxiously thinking about it you're kind of okay at doing damaging damage control and then what is the conclusion that your mind comes to your mind is like thank God we spent all of that time thinking through every single permutation and combination because when our professor did email us and say Hey where's your paper what's wrong why I haven't received it yet you had everything planned and planning leads to survival so this is the way that the anxious brain works it reaches a new level of homeostasis which is that it starts to see greater threats and tries to approach problems purely mentally and this is explains kind of the experience of people with anxiety which is why you can sit in bed and do nothing to solve your problems and anxiously be thinking about it over and over and over and over again so that's things from a mental perspective and we'll get into a little bit more about how to deal with that and therapists can absolutely help with that okay but there are a couple of other things that I think we need to explore the first is that our cardiovascular and autonomic nervous system so this is the system that governs things like adrenaline relaxation you know danger signals this system is very very active when it comes to anxiety and so a big part of what we do especially as medical doctors is we'll try to medicate anxiety generally speaking most of our medications have been neurologic in nature so they affect the brain but we're starting to see a lot of really interesting research around non-anxiety medications for anxiety things that affect your heart rate things that affect your immune system can also be beneficial for people with anxiety so let's understand how this works this is really cool our heart adapts to changes okay so if you are walking down the street and you get jumped by a pack of wolves your heart rate will increase our body responds to that change it Alters the way that it reacts to a particular environment so our heart rate goes up okay when we're in a relaxed situation our heart rate goes down our body is able to adapt to particular stresses in people who are anxious that adaptation ability is weakened so what we sort of see is that things are always on kind of high alert so we see less variation in the body's ability to adapt to a stressor because we're already operating at high levels of stress at Baseline and why are we operating at high levels of stress at Baseline that's because we learned as a five-year-old that the world is a dangerous place and we can't count on other people we have to be on high alert all the time hyper vigilance is a survival strategy and that gets baked in to our neurons not just neurons in the brain but neurons all over the body our body's ability to adjust its heart rate in response to stress is blunted in people with anxiety so we also see this in cases of things like PTSD so if you look at the heart's ability to modulate its activity after you get diagnosed with PTSD your ability to modulate activity goes down you are always on high alert there's other really interesting things that people have been able to discover so some people some researchers have also been able to predict which emotion you are feeling by looking at your heart rhythm they can predict with 75 accuracy the way that your heartbeat determines your emotion they figured this out okay 75 accuracy we're not 100 of the way there yet but we're pretty good at that so this is where we start to see a whole other realm of consideration about anxiety which is that when you're physiologically active it's going to change the way that you think because remember our body and brain are moving in concert it's not like the mind is completely disconnected from the heart like those two things work together so we know for example that adrenaline causes perceived threats to become and feel more real it causes a focusing of the mind on the particular threat so what what do we see in anxiety clinically we see distractibility it's not distractibility you're not distracted you can't focus on what you want to focus on because your mind is hell-bent on focusing on anxiety it forces you to focus on the the threat and this is physiologically mediated so if we can control our heart rate and if we can control our autonomic nervous system we will reduce our anxiety the third angle that a lot of people are not really familiar with especially when it comes to therapists and this isn't an indictment on them it's just they're not trained in that right because we're just learning this stuff is gut health so this is super wild but the bacteria in our gut heavily influence our anxiety level so there are a lot of different mechanisms at play here the first is that people with irritable bowel syndrome also have some degree of depression and anxiety we also see cases like inflammatory bowel disease which is when you get an autoimmune inflammation of your intestines when people have autoimmune inflammation of their intestines they're they also experience worsening depression and anxiety so we've also discovered that depression and anxiety are to a certain degree inflammatory conditions since their inflammatory conditions this is wild if I take a patient with IBD inflammatory bowel disease and I give them an immunomodulatory agent I literally like kind of shot off or suppress their immune system their anxiety improves you see clinically significant scientifically valid results of anxiety reduction when I modulate someone's immune system what is going on there let's understand okay so we have guts we have our gut bacteria okay got our intestines and stuff and in our intestines we have a lot of bacteria that live there and hang out there by the way you have 10 times as many bacterial cells in your body as you have human cells okay that's wild so you actually the number of cells in your body is like nine to one ten to one bacteria to human cells so you've got a ton of bacteria in there now let's understand what are these bacteria doing so we have a symbiotic relationship with those bacteria so over a million years 10 million years whatever we've grown up as human beings and we have all this bacteria that live in our gut and the bacteria does stuff for us so bacteria will do things like break down food that's why it lives in our gut they'll do things like consume particular nutrients and they will also produce particular nutrients because we have a nice relationship with our bacteria right they're going to live in the gut and they're going to Farm nutrients for us and we are going to provide them with some degree of protection and whatnot there's some bacteria which are healthy bacteria which do not activate our immune system because our immune system is learned hey these are our allies we should not mess with them right they're helping us so now what has changed the most in our society over the last hundred years diet diet has transformed completely Twinkies did not exist a hundred years ago right you didn't get all those different kinds of food we didn't have frozen food or anything like that we just ate what was fresh we ate what was around we had a very limited kind of food so then what happens is once we start eating different food what happens to our gut bacteria so as we make dietary changes like let's say I eat a piece of broccoli so broccoli can be broken down and consumed by certain kinds of bacteria and those are the commensurate bacteria those are the bacteria that help us out so they break down the broccoli because human beings have been eating broccoli for a while right we've been eating like green leafy stuff and foraging and whatnot potatoes and things like that a little bit of meat whatever and so we we will grow the bacteria depending on what we feed them so now as we eat more processed foods we are selecting for the bacteria that can eat processed foods and so have those bacteria been in our guts for a million years absolutely not these are new bacteria they're foreign bacteria they're the twinkie eating bacteria so as we develop these Twinkie eating bacteria in our guts they cause inflammation because this is our body's like hey like we've never seen this bacteria before this guy doesn't belong here let's attack it so as we increase the inflammation in the gut that inflammation travels all the way to the brain right because when we have an infection if I have like a cold let's say and even the cold is localized to my nose I feel the inflammation all over my body the fever if I've got like the flu or something like that is going to be all over our body so our body will respond in a complete way in a total way in a holistic way to even inflammation within the gut there's also now evidence that certain kinds of bacteria have been linked to Parkinson's disease Alzheimer's disease as well as anxiety and we'll get to that in a second so gut bacteria become really important next thing to understand gut bacteria will produce things and consume things that we put into our body so what does this mean so we know that as psychiatrists we will prescribe serotonergic medications to help people with anxiety we will increase serotonin signal in the brain with medication so what about gut bacteria so this is really fascinating there are some kinds of gut bacteria that will gobble up the serotonin precursors so there are certain neurotransmitters there are certain building blocks that's where they come from right that come travel from our gut to our brain and then we turn those building blocks into things like neurotransmitters like dopamine serotonin Etc there are some bacteria that will gobble those up so if they're gobbling it up there is not enough building blocks going to the brain to make serotonin or whatever else there are other bacteria that not only don't gobble it up but will produce excess and share it with us this is a trading situation where we give you food in a safe place to stay and you are going to produce neurotransmitter precursors for us building blocks you're going to send them to the brain and we're going to turn them into neurotransmitters so as a clinician when I work with patients with anxiety the ones that are able to adhere to an anti-anxiety diet are the ones that I can bring off of medication way more easy I'll start someone on an anti-anxiety medication like an SSRI if they adhere to good diet for about a year and I pull them off of the SSRI they do fine it's the ones that aren't able to adhere to the diet that have more problems on average so what is our gut bacteria doing for us three things one is the good bacteria is producing neurotransmitters for us basically and it's not causing inflammation and the ones that are bad for us are consuming the building blocks that we need and furthermore are causing inflammation and remember that what is inflammation going to do to your heart it's going to elevate your heart rate as inflammation elevates your heart rate that is going to send signals to your brain to make you more anxious wild right and this is the shortcoming is that we don't understand this stuff in clinical practice we haven't really implemented it yet so just to give you all an example there is one bacteria that I I kid you not is called ruminococcus I have no idea how where that name came from I looked for it it is literally called ruminococcus rumination and when ruminococcus levels are low in the gut bacteria anxiety is high the severity of anxiety increases more people if you have low ruminococcus levels chances are you will have anxiety right it's wild there are four or five other bacteria that are very focused on anxiety okay or related to anxiety the last thing that we're going to talk about maybe second to last is the mind so when it comes to the mind there's a lot that you can do here there's also where seeing a therapist is a really good idea but let's understand what the approach in therapy is okay especially for those of you all that feel like okay my anxiety isn't that bad that I need to see a therapist but I still want to get control of it this is important to understand so the first thing that you've got to do is understand the wiring of your brain in terms of what is a threat so go back and this is why a lot of therapy focuses on childhood what are the lessons that you learned in childhood so in The Vedic model like this is the model that our coaches use when they're sort of trying to promote Wellness we'll sort of focus on the formation of something called a samskar so a samskar is like a ball of energy that shapes the way a ball of emotional energy that shapes the way that you perceive the world okay so when we have a samskar it like it triggers this activity in our brain that causes us to perceive things as threats but that is all based on this ball of emotional energy so if you go back and you actually pay attention to your experiences in childhood you will find that even thinking about them will cause tears to come up we'll evoke fear and we'll evoke Panic that means that that emotion is sitting there in your brain in your mind and is shaping the way that you see the world so you have to go back and ask yourself okay I am let's say you're anxious about a particular thing I'm worried that people will abandon me let's say where did you learn to be afraid that people will abandon you chances are it's because you had some kind of traumatic experience in childhood where someone abandoned you and so then your brain learned hey we can't trust people and so you carry that learning with you forward to the present day the problem is it helped you survive back then now it makes your life hard today so you have to go back and digest that emotional energy the second thing that you can do is understand the effect of the anxiety in the present and now we have to understand something really important about anxiety when someone is faced with anxiety as we experience more anxiety what people with anxiety do is this anxiety is caused by a situation right other people may not believe that it's real but that's neither here nor there and so what do you do as someone who's anxious you try to control the situation because if you control the situation your anxiety will come down anyway I'm afraid someone is going to break up with me they could break up with me this is a real situation my anxiety is high how do I fix this I'm going to get them to promise never to break up with me I'm going to engage in behaviors to bring down to control the situation because if I can control the situation then the anxiety will come with it you see these two things are tied and so what do people with anxiety do they try to control the world around them controlling the world around you is difficult arguably impossible and if you can't control your partner or your boss or your professor or your friends or your parents what do you do you keep trying in your head over and over and over again and why do you never solve your problems you never solve the problems because it's someone else you can't control another human being then why don't you quit why do you keep trying to solve the problem because that is the survival mechanism that you learned right that is anxiety in a nutshell so we try to control the circumstances around us we try to control other people to bring our anxiety down that's a losing formula but that's what we do so what else can you do there are two or three things to understand here one is that we can disconnect this safe situation low anxiety dangerous situation high anxiety we can control this disconnect we can actually be like this where our anxiety can be high in the situation to be safe or the situation you can feel unsafe and we don't actually have to control it to tolerate our own anxiety we can learn how to tolerate anxiety because this is what people with anxiety don't learn how to do right because what they learn is a survival mechanism is as a five-year-old you can't teach yourself to tolerate anxiety you just have to deal with it so what you can practically do is learn how to tolerate some of these anxieties so this is where if you look at like evidence-based treatment for phobias for example what therapists will do is exposure therapy so we're going to put you in a situation that activates your anxiety but we're not going to let you control the situation you're just going to wait until your body returns to homeostasis which it will do why doesn't that happen in people with anxiety because we spend so much time trying to control the situation escape from the situation that we never develop the ability for tolerance right if a social situation makes me anxious and I decide to avoid it what happens to my ability to tolerate negative emotion it goes down because I'm controlling the situation and since the situation is controlled my anxiety is controlled I never learned tolerance so this is where I would say sit with it and understand exactly what you are sitting with it's hard to just sit with it but understand this is what you should tell yourself in this moment my mind is terrified of this this feels a hundred percent real notice your physical Sensations right this is my body trying to protect me from this and this is a reaction that my body learned if you've done some scar oriented worker therapy you can even go back and you say this is how my body learned to survive here and tolerate it for as long as you can right start low okay I'm going to go into the social situation for five minutes and I'm not going to pull out my phone for five minutes and then afterward you can escape into your phone go for it right so start to learn how to tolerate that negative emotion as you learn to tolerate the negative emotion the negative emotion will start to come down as the negative emotion starts to come down you will be able to engage with things around you okay the last thing to consider kind of related to this is watch out for the tie between your anxiety and your behavior so when we are anxious especially if we have if we have an unhealthy relationship with anxiety we are going to use Behavior to control our anxiety right so I will plead with someone not to break up with me or I'll start crying or I'll avoid things so watch out for that instinctive reaction of behavior to make yourself feel safe and try not to engage in it right away this is also a central principle of cognitive behavioral therapy so if you need help with that work with a therapist the last thing and this is a little bit off the wall but this has honestly helped a lot of people that I've worked with is to detach so if you really look at anxiety anxiety usually has to do with the ego and what do I mean by that I'm opening a whole new can of worms which we can do a whole new video about but if you think about anxiety the consequence always has to do with you this person won't like me this person will think I'm stupid this person won't respect me this person won't give me opportunities this person will break up with me anxiety is usually about sometimes it can be around things like health related stuff like you know other kinds of fears and stuff but a lot of times it has to do with ego it has to do with I in some way and so there's another process which is its own thing of detachment where you sort of separate yourself from the ego and so what if someone doesn't like you so imagine what your life would be like if you were not always trying to shape and control other people's perceptions of you because that's what a lot of anxiety turns into this is how people become doormats I can't afford to have this person dislike me and since I can't afford to have this person dislike me I can never set a boundary with them since I never sat around with them I become a doormat and they start to become abusive because I don't check their behavior there's never a consequence for their behavior and then the anxious person gets stuck they become frustrated with themselves they become frustrated with the other person but they don't know what to do about it and so the real antidote to all the stuff at the end of the day is detachment is to separate yourself a little bit from the ego and okay so this person dislikes me so what right and this is what people may tell you why do you care about what this person thinks and you're like I don't know I wish I couldn't but I do and then how do you solve that how do you develop that attachment you go back detachment you go back when did I learn that I cannot afford to piss anyone off that's the samskar that is controlling you that is preventing the detachment once again there are practices that you can do right meditative practices spiritual practices things like that can help you develop Detachment we have a whole path on that in in Dr K's guide to meditation so but for you all to understand this is also where there's studies that show that spiritual perspectives to anxiety can be incredibly helpful one of the mechanisms through which things like mindfulness and even some of the the studies on psychedelics show that the mechanism of action here is that they separate you from your ego and so that's another aspect to consider so if you're trying to deal with anxiety I know it's a super challenging and overwhelming topic but my hope is that if you understand how anxiety develops and what the mechanisms are in the in the body and the brain and the mind that you can develop a system to kind of tackle it if you're already working with a mental health professional My Hope Is that you can integrate some of the stuff into your existing treatment if you're not working with a mental health professional I strongly recommend you get an evaluation and then you can also if you don't need to then you can also use some of these techniques to promote Health right and this is another core problem with our system of medicine in the west is that we treat sickness we don't build health and so how does anxiety work in the body and in the brain first of all it is a learned experience it is a change in your Baseline to perceive normal things as highly threatening why did you learn that how did you get wired like that because that's what you needed to survive so how can we fix this problem the first is we can change our diet we can eat certain foods healthy diet things that are more traditionally eaten by human beings so like you know this is where a lot of that sort of like keto diet sort of comes in it's not so much grains that's necessarily a problem it's that a lot of these grains are processed which we didn't grow up eating so there's a lot of details also on diet y'all can check out Dr K's guide but you can also think about some of those probiotics and things like that definitely something to consider but the more inflammation in your gut there is the less healthier your gut bacteria is the more likely you are to be anxious second organ system we're going to talk about is the heart the heart is incredibly important it's not just the heart by the way the heart is just the one thing that we use to measure and capture all the other parts of our body so if we look at the exercise benefits on anxiety we're just focusing on the heart but exercise is going to have benefits on the kidneys which are going to affect your anxiety it's going to have benefits on your liver your skeletal muscle all of these things will affect your anxiety and this is the core shortcoming that we see with therapy today is that therapists are solely trained in the mind but anxiety does not solely exist in the mind so you can do everything from heart chakra meditations to exercise you got to slow down that physiology and the last thing that we're going to focus on is the mind and that where that's where you have to understand how did I program this in the first place go back to that digest that emotion because that will be driving your anxiety you'll feel that emotion come up and it's going to be an emotion from the past and so as you digest and process that emotion your anxiety will weaken in the present the next thing that you can do is manage your anxiety in the present by building the capacity for tolerance and not engaging in those default behaviors that control the situation because the more that you control the situation the more you are artificially short-circuiting your anxiety and then if you if that's the way that you've done things which is usually how you do things then you end up with this disaster scenario where the way that I deal with my anxiety is controlling the situation but if the way that I deal with my anxiety is controlling the situation and I can't control the situation then what happens then you get tortured with anxiety over and over and over again you're thinking about something for a whole week and you can't fix it you can't fix it you can't fix it but you keep trying you keep trying you keep trying and you're exhausted as you get exhausted your frontal lobes weaken your willpower weakens you eat unhealthy food you stop exercising and then you The Dominoes start to fall and the anxiety gets out of control so I sincerely hope that this has been helpful to you today for you to understand where does anxiety come from how does it manifest and what are the different levers that I can pull because it's far beyond the mind and if all that stuff isn't enough do the spiritual stuff check out Detachment by all means and the more you can cultivate that the more it'll make everything else easy so good luck
