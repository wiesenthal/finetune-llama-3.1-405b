foreign [Music] and you might know me as Dr k [Music] welcome to Dr K's guide to mental health over the past two years we've been making videos together that help you understand yourself and the community has now grown Beyond twitch and YouTube as we've grown so has the demand for different tools for us to use together so I've decided to create this guide my main goal hasn't ever been just to teach you but rather to guide you step by step into building the life that you want [Music] these modules are a distillation the essence of my personal journey to understand myself over the last two decades they're kind of like a Choose Your Own Adventure to understand a particular topic because in my experience the best outcomes come from educated patients so with these videos you'll find worksheets exercises citations and even discussion to help you along the way okay fine I'm in this place and this place sucks what am I going to do about it now right because what does it mean to have fallen behind it's a construct of the Mind what does it mean to catch up it's a construct of the mind if meditation has one good effect on the brain it actually strengthens the hell out of your frontal lobes and you can absolutely browse Tick Tock for four hours but I can guarantee you that our three is not going to be as fun as the first 10 minutes what stimulant medications do is actually stimulate the frontal cortex so what we're actually boosting the signal of is our ability to control the rest of our brain there's a certain method there's a certain secret there's a certain technique to being able to find that piece in spite of the emotion foreign [Music] your mental health can be so daunting because we're never really taught about our minds not from our parents certainly not in schools not really anywhere and so this guide was built out of community feedback y'all explained to us what the challenges you face are and we've built these resources to help you tackle the problems of the digital age
