another healthy gamer GG stream my name is aloe canoja just a reminder that although I'm a psychiatrist nothing we discussed on stream today is intended to be taken as medical advice everything is for educational or entertainment purposes only if y'all have a concern or question please go see a licensed professional happy Friday everybody happy June everybody um yeah we're we've got an awesome interview today we're going to be talking with Mr Cat about lgbtqia struggles so we're going to hop into that in just one second um but I just wanted to see how everybody's doing uh yeah so as you guys noticed we've got mods that will oh did the thing okay well how are you all doing first live okay welcome Soldier happy Friday yes happy pride month everybody absolutely um yeah we can ask uh Mr Cat what lgbtqia stands for good y'all are good well I'm hyped too should we just hop right in so anything that you guys want to talk about or let's let's interview let's go I'm feeling like going like I'm feeling like enough preamble let's do what we came here to do chat let's understand a little bit about the experiences of people in the lgbtqia space because that's what we do here we want to understand what people's lives are like right and we try to be non-judgmental or if we're going to be judgmental which I know is kind of weird we want to be judgmental with compassion which I know may be confusing for people so let's go ahead and hop in uh um ready let's do it chat chat Lords hello can you just count to ten for me to count to ten for me okay awesome uh try one more time one two three four five six okay awesome I'm gonna just turn you up a little bit try now oh one two three four okay awesome that's great I just need to change one other thing because for some reason this thinks that you are the Surgeon General of the United States just kind of fix that oh well was that unclear yeah I think that explains so much ah that makes sense I'm gonna have to add some spaces also thank you chat for helping me count to 10 I forgot a couple numbers in there yeah we're going to be learning all kinds of stuff today like how how to count maybe past ten I've never gotten that far that's well this is what we do here we push push the boundaries and learn new stuff so this is so cool I did um yeah so can you can you start by telling us what you prefer to be called sure so uh my name is Misty um I am a Minecraft Youtuber my pronouns are she they so just anything that's not he pretty much um my identity is an androsexual Demi girl which essentially just means I'm non-binary but I like guys and there's just specific terminology for that okay so can you and is there anything in particular we're talking about today um I jotted down a couple notes but um just in general the reason so why I'm here is I saw you guys made a channel post saying you're looking for people to talk to absolutely I thought since it's pride month why not volunteer myself thank you very much for doing that yeah of course um people got in touch and here I am but um mainly um I've watched a lot of your videos for a couple years now but as someone that struggled with LGBT issues I noticed you didn't have too many videos like that on here so I just wanted to try and help you get something going for that Community because I've always liked your videos but you never had the specific stuff I was after so maybe I can help some people out today we'll see yeah that's awesome all right so Misty I really really appreciate that and I think that um you highlighted a couple of really important things so a lot of times you know the the quote unquote videos that we make are based on the people that we talk to and our goal here is to understand the lived experience of different people on the Earth yeah and so I'm really grateful for you being here today and um is there anything in particular about so I you know I can ask a bunch of questions but is there a particular place that um or particular things that you were hoping to share today uh sure so some things I just thought of leading up to this is that um for creators specifically there's a lot of fear of coming out as the Creator which is something I did just a couple weeks ago oh wow um oh thank you um there's a lot of misgendering issues in the space which can be difficult to deal with which I'm still not positive but maybe we can work through that um there's a lot of just harassment in general which obviously of course um so like one thing is I don't neces like my face isn't like hidden like I have like I've like revealed my face before it's not like I need some big face reveal but typically it's just better just to use like an avatar like this just to not get harassment even if like you are perfectly like normal attractive whatever just there's a lot of stuff behind just how much people hate that stuff and then uh the last thing I had was um that I actually have been swatted because of my identity which is something we could talk about oh my God that sounds terrible a little bit so you know Misty the first thing that I just kind of want to notice is that I'm hearing that in addition to all of the normal difficulties of life like getting out of bed and eating healthy and finding motivation and trying to figure out what you're doing with your life you have a layer of additional challenges that sounds like really tough um it can be from my perspective though I think I genuinely have like a really lucky and good life and the way I see it is that if this is the only thing I struggle with my life's amazing compared to other people but I do understand it is a very deep issue and it is something I've definitely struggled with if that makes sense absolutely um so can we just start by can you please explain to us some of like the terminology uh so can you start by telling us what lgbtqia plus means sure um so it stands for lesbian gay bisexual transgender queer I think intersex and then I don't know what the a is something that I've learned about uh I just call it like Pride or queer whatever in general is that it's evolving so much so quickly that I don't think any queer person I know fully knows what all of the terms mean because there's so much coming out so many people are exploring it it's kind of just you learn something new you look it up if that makes sense that I've always wondered how do we decide which which letters to include and which ones to not include I have no idea personally I've also wondered this that's why I again I just say like the pride or like queer people just it's kind of like a blanket term and people get what you're talking about okay and you mentioned that you are an androsexual Demi girl can you help us understand that yeah sure so um so how the gender Spectrum works is it's kind of like a slider between male to female well where non-binary is anything that's not on either end of the spectrum but then it also kind of goes down a little bit into like agender or like mixed gender or whatever so um Demi girl means I'm non-binary but slightly on the feminine side so I'm kind of in the middle between male and female but slightly on the feminine side if that makes sense and then uh androsexual it gets weird saying if you're straight or gay when you're talking about non-binary people so that just means no matter what your gender is you like guys if that makes sense okay okay so you're you're physically so I I see that in your in the way that you describe yourself there is a component of what your identity is and what you were attracted to and that those two things are actually like somewhat independent yeah can you help us understand that a little bit in which ways so um I'm just kind of thinking of people who are not very familiar with some of these terminologies or experiences of life and so even as you kind of mentioned androsexual like solves a problem right because if you're gay or homosexual that implies that you are attracted to the same gender that you identify as right and and so the challenge though is that being attracted to the same gender if your gender is non-binary or fluid like so you you know what does it mean to be a homosexual Demi girl does it mean that you are attracted to other Demi girls or what and so I was just kind of like alluding to the idea that like gay and straight are kind of those terms are couched in binary genders but I guess I I kind of explained it a lot of it's just kind of person to person like a lot of people who are like a male who like a female might still say they're gay just because it like fits with how they feel if that makes sense yeah okay so can you tell us just a little bit about yourself and what kind of growing up was like for you sure so um I come from an extremely religious household I am religious myself um I recently came out a week ago um as intersexual didn't go to online although I just told my family I'm gay because it's close enough they don't know what any of that means and um in general I've known about my sexuality for about nine years my gender has been I've been figuring it out for a couple years but uh typically uh oh I should say that coming out to my family did go well at all went super nice everyone's happy Etc it didn't there were no issues any of that kind of stuff but um I had been afraid of there being issues for a very long time because again my family is religious and that's typically something that doesn't go over very well in that kind of situation so it definitely took me a long time a lot of courage to finally Build It Up but um once I did it was like a big relief I could finally start being myself for the first time in forever over half my life um I had to date people in secret I had to like not talk about anything like relating to LGBT stuff in case they would like get a hint or something there's a very anxiety filled if that makes sense so it sounds like you were hiding yeah the way I've uh described it before is it kind of feels like you're in like that old like spy movie where like oh you're like the Russian spy and they're trying to figure out you can't leave any traces yeah so what's it like to grow up and kind of be a spy in your own life yeah um it's just mainly you just can't really do anything like I couldn't use any dating apps for fear that someone would find it and show a family member or like if I did a live stream I couldn't comment on like someone I thought was attractive because maybe one of my family members kids is watching and they'll tell and that'll go all up escalated all right just any of that kind of stuff like if I had um a boyfriend I couldn't like have him around or like meet my family we'd have to like go out somewhere in secret and then be back before a certain time or whatever and do you remember what kind of like so I'm sort of seeing that you're planning your life around preventing information getting out is that fair to say I can agree yeah it definitely feels like what I've done yeah so I I mean what kind of scenarios were you envisioning like when you would do those kinds of things right like let's say using a dating app like what were what was going on in your head about like what would happen uh in my head so I I just couldn't use dating apps because it's kind of like a built-in paranoia if that makes sense but uh essentially like I would just Envision like oh someone's scrolling through Tinder and then they see me and they see that I'm looking for men and then they show someone they know and then that person knows a family member is I have a very large family in a very small area and so there's like a lot of people that it could actually get to and does that make sense yeah it does so I'm kind of curious like what did you have like kind of thoughts about what would happen if someone did see oh I see what you mean um yeah I would just assume that it would go over a lot worse if they found out from someone else where I wasn't even prepared to talk about it rather than me to be prepared and tell them individually myself which is definitely what I think you should do so how I came out was I just worked up person to person from like the most important people in my life to just like my general family not as if they're not important but you know what I mean yeah and uh just individually talking through tell them hey this is what's going on um Etc whereas if they just found out from like their little cousin who had a phone and looked at a website I feel like that wouldn't go over well yeah so like what so what I'm sort of imagining Misty is that there may be lots of people out there who are listening to this conversation and will listen to this conversation in the future and I think we talk about in a general sense like coming out but I think that my experience at least as a mental health professional like working with people around this stuff is that there's like you know we just use two two words coming out and it's kind of binary but my experience is that there's actually like a whole pile of thoughts fears behaviors that can like grow over the course of years and in your case it sounds like you know you've been you've been uh sort of exploring this for like at least a decade or about a decade um and so what I was hoping to do is understand you know a little bit more color about your experience because I imagine that they're going to be people who can relate to those details yeah okay um so one thing that actually helped me was since I've been a growing content creator I got a bunch of opportunities in June this year for pride month such as YouTube wanted to feature me on their Channel I got invited to a big uh Pride Minecraft tournament Etc and this was all happening like the very beginning of June so what pushed me to come out was um all this happening and my family is like into like my YouTube stuff they watched all my videos and Etc so I went to them and said hey just so you know I got these amazing opportunities you're gonna see this I just wanted to let you know beforehand to hear it from me and not from them because I think one of the biggest things you can do when coming out is let them know that you do respect how they feel so if you say like um I understand you may not understand what I'm doing you may not like uh like it it might not make you happy but I don't want to hurt you I just want you to know that this is what makes me happy and let me know if there's anything I can do to like help you along this process or Etc if that makes sense yeah that makes a lot of sense so I'm noticing already that the way that you came out was not antagonistic and that's very important and respecting their beliefs because I I know a lot of people will sort of consider some beliefs backwards and whatnot but I'm not hearing you really do that so like my uh grandma is probably the most religious person so I made sure that when I came out to her I was like I still like love God I'm like will probably still go to church now and then like it doesn't affect any of that this is just who I am and I understand it's not fully in line with your stuff but I hope you can learn to accept me because I am not gonna let it like change who I am this is just a fact if that makes sense um is it do you feel comfortable if I ask you a little bit more detail about your family's reactions of course so like what did your grandma say it went very well she was like I understand thank you for telling me that I still love you I'll always love you just you're always welcome in my house make sure you ever need anything call me wow it went pretty quick which that was way better than I expected yeah what were you afraid was going to happen um I was afraid to like start like really crying so like Oh no you're going to hell but uh I mean maybe that will be for some people it could be very case to case but according to my grandparents um that when they both talked to both of them uh they were kind of just like not too surprised because again I had been I had known for over about nine years that I'm some kind of queer and so I have been slowly like dropping hints like I've painted my nails and stuff like that and they were kind of like yeah there there were the signs so I think it does help that it kind of eased them into it if that makes sense and and so what what were some of the other signs that they had sort of picked up on um I think I am kind of flamboyant my voice has gotten higher pitched over time um I've had no interest in women for a decade or kind of ever um if that makes sense yeah and how does your voice get higher pitched over time uh so a lot of my YouTube stuff is vocal training and I do a lot of voice acting so I've just like done a lot of training and tried to get to a voice that I feel is more suitable for me if that makes sense sure and and what do you mean by flamboyant what does that look like I haven't really noticed it myself but like my friends have told me I do like like the gay hand gestures or something if that makes sense yeah I I I mean I I have certain stereotypes in my mind but yeah no I get it um okay so so I I guess some of your mannerisms are not I guess what we could call traditionally masculine is that fair to say green yeah and and so your voice changes somewhat you also kind of uh will paint your nails which I as as I understand I'm I'm you know joining the boomer generation very quickly but I understand that painting nails is not even like related to being queer in any way now is that yeah okay I mean it is to them probably because right no one else they know does it and so um that sounds really fantastic uh Misty I I think uh you know and I I may accidentally misgender you for which I apologize but I'm gonna do my best um but that sounds fantastic that you've you know that you're it sounds like you respect your family a lot your family respects you a lot and that the coming out process uh was sort of if I can kind of summarize was like first of all not so you started out as a spy but then you started dropping hints or maybe not dropping hints so much as like restrain your paranoia a little bit so I'm kind of curious about that like when you decided to paint your nails what was going on in your head and like what did you think could happen uh well everything I've done I've had like an excuse for so the reason I started painting my nails was it was the year my YouTube channel started blowing up and for Halloween I cosplayed my character and so you see I have like the green and orange eyes that's like a big part of my brand I made my right hand green nails in my left hand orange nails for the costume and then uh they were like oh that's funny you did your nails for your costume and then I just kept doing it and they kind of like didn't realize and they're like oh I guess this is just a thing now just kind of again easing people into it has made it a lot easier for me at least yeah so I mean it's it's so interesting how how much you have to calculate yeah I mean it could just be me I don't know but that's kind of how I see most situations yeah so you okay so you're kind of easing them into it and then it sounds like you mentioned that like working up the courage can you help us understand what that what that looks like or how that like how does one do that um that's a great question because it took me so long but um it's kind of I don't think anyone really just like snaps their fingers and comes out I don't think that's how it works so like my friends like my close friends have known since I did about all this I've always kept them updated my mom's kind of known for about eight years I kind of waited a little bit to tell her but eventually talked to her she understood and then like as people came into my life the more I like trusted them outside my family I would tell them until eventually I got this big opportunity and use that to come out but um that's how you go so so your your mom has known that you're androsexual but did you refer to it as androsexual eight years ago um I just referred to it as gay but I didn't know what my gender was and and what was that can you tell us a little bit about what that conversation looked like or how you worked up to it I can think but again it's been like eight years yeah um it was just kind of like a hey I need to have a serious talk with you I've been feeling like this for a while she also wasn't surprised back then she had kind of a similar reaction to my grandma like snow this doesn't change anything still love you Etc okay and I'm kind of noticing that like a big part of how you pitch it is that so oftentimes I think families who don't understand will sort of think of you as one kind of person and so when you come out to them you become a different person I agree and they sort of try to hold on to their old impression of you and like that's the real you Misty and maybe you're sick or something like that um and so if we like help you enough you can return back to the quote unquote real you one thing that I I noticed in your language which I think is actually really really cool is that you say this is who I am this is who I've always been and so it's sort of like owning like I am this and I I don't know how else to describe it but I think there's there's just a lot of because when I think about people coming out and sort of explaining um issues of gender identity or um sexual attraction that are not heteronormative like it's kind of weird right because we have like guides or like videos or resources of like how to make a resume and how to like go on a job interview but no one ever tells us like this is how you come out to your family yeah and and so that's what I really appreciate about everything you're kind of sharing and why I'm asking for details they appreciate you asking us because I would have loved this video like like two three years ago yeah and so that's why we're doing it right so we're two or three years too late but hopefully not too late for everyone who's watching um were there other things so you mentioned kind of working up the courage so it sounds like you started disclosing some information about yourself like years ago so is there are there other things that you can share with us about this kind of working up the courage um well I think one of the best things you can do is uh during college they had like a counseling service you could go to for free is like part of the tuition and so I was going there specifically to like an LGBT counselor and uh she was helping me walk through stuff and work out courage and um that was kind of a good thing I feel like since there is such a lack of information I think just finding an expert on the topic if you can afford it sadly a lot of people can't afford it um can help you a bunch like I have a counselor I saw a couple weeks ago for when I was coming out and she helped me a ton with like how to go about everything the process like uh working on like a script I could use for each person wow so you guys like literally like thought about a script and worked through a script what if it's okay if you feel comfortable sharing what were some of the other things what is what is working on look like or mean I was afraid my family would be like upset or maybe angry or whatever she mainly kept me working on like it will be okay even if it goes wrong it's not the end of the world like regardless your family will still love you Etc they just kind of have every insurance that like you can do it it's okay it's not going to be as big of a deal as you think it is um and she was right about everything she told me so yeah and do you have a sense of where um your counselor's confidence came from I'm just telling her about my family because we talk a couple times she's like so you want to come out to your grandpa tell me what he's like or how he feels and then I tell her that and then she's like okay I think he'll be perfectly fine I think Etc Mr cat can I uh think for a second sure any questions for me um I think my only question for you would be if you had questions for me I have more questions I have a ton of questions for you okay perfect um I was just kind of jotting down because I like I was kind of saying no one teaches us how to come out um and oftentimes like it's it's so to the public it's so binary right like you've come out and then it's kind of like done but what I'm sort of really appreciating about hearing your story uh is that it's like one hell of a process it's anything but binary even in terms of like self-determination and figuring out who you are and what you're attracted to in the way that you talk to people and I think that like I think hearing kind of the pieces and I I may try to summarize towards the end and kind of run by you what I've actually ended ended up hearing and almost like I wonder if by the end of this call we can have like a 10 minute how-to on how to come out because that I think could be incredibly helpful for people what do you think I I do think it's extremely Case by case and everybody has their own best way to do it but I still think like a general guidelines can't hurt absolutely uh so the next question that I've got for you is how do you how did you know that you're androsexual um I've just never liked girls and I've always liked guys so even as a kid I had I think like five girlfriends up to middle school but the only reason I had girlfriends is because I watched cartoons and the main character wants a girlfriend and then he's cool and so I thought oh I need a girlfriend and then I'll be cool and like you know that's just kind of how it works but I was never really interested in them hold on you had five girlfriends up until middle school so you were like a mega Chad bro in elementary school I guess you could say that yeah so that's really interesting so as a scientist I wonder actually how common that is I wonder if prepubescent romantic relationships with women is actually like I wonder if that correlates with being Andrew sexual it could be interesting I don't know okay so so you had a lot and and how what was that like like how do you even get a girlfriend in like the third grade or fourth grade I think you're just kind of like hey you want to be my girlfriend and they're like sure and then you like sit at lunch together that's so interesting because because I was hilarious but I'm sort of like thinking about my own experience right and and how like if you're actually a heterosexual man asking a girl out is very terrifying and and I wonder if the lack of sexual attraction or romantic interest actually makes it such so much more easier or casual I think you might be 100 right I've never thought about that but it definitely feels like that makes sense so when you were like in elementary school did you what was your relationship with with boys like um normal okay so you had like friends and stuff it's not like you were so you had girlfriends but it's not like most of your friends were women and then what happened in Middle School what was that like [Music] questioning before like a lot of time like I'd see like a cartoon character or someone that I'd like really like or something and then uh I think it was I watched the Wizards of Waverly Place and there was a character named Justin Russo and I'd always thought he was super cute and I just never really put it into words because that wasn't in my mind that was something I could think and then eventually around High School sometime um I was with some of my friends I don't remember the conversation but um I I found out that it's not normal to like find in terms of like heterosexuality to find uh men attractive and so we were like in the car and I said like isn't it weird how like sometimes you just find guys attractive and they're like no and I was like wait is this what and that's when I started exploring it a little more I I once worked with someone um who was a heterosexual man who said that they had a penis fetish they're like I'm not gay I just have a fetish for penises that's kind of funny and I was like okay I was not quite sure how to interpret that but I was like bro you might be gay he's like nah man I just have a fetish for penises you know it's like they just turned me on and I'm like what do you think the definition of gay is I can't blame him you know I I still don't know I mean it's possible it was bisexual he was you know not too interested in self-exploration and he found he found a um what how what can we say we he found a explanation that worked for him so even to this day I I try really hard to not be judgmental but I kind of noticed that like I'm being judgmental about it but anyway um okay so it sounds like you just you just sort of thought boys were cute and I mean in terms of like so it sounds like you also just didn't find girls attractive or you did or what um I've never found women attractive no if I do it's because I like imagined myself like in their position with like a hot guy or something um so that's actually uh is it okay if we talk a little bit more about more sexual details like I'm not going to go into tons of sexual details but that sort of thing um so this is also something I've seen a lot so can you explain what you mean by imagine myself at basically in the girl's position when you're thinking about sexual stuff right mm-hmm so you like and I maybe I'll just go ahead and explain it because I don't know how to tactfully ask you questions about this while respecting boundaries but this is also something that I've seen a fair amount when I work with people who have issues of of or exploring maybe is a better way to put it um issues of of gender identity or sexuality is like I'll ask actually a set of questions which is uh you know the first question that I ask when trying to help people figure out if they are gay or bisexual or whatever is um you know what do you get horny about really really simple question another really good question that I found is just very very helpful this like by the way like we can sort of figure out within five minutes whether someone is or is not your mileage may vary but I actually find that we are so shy in the way that we ask questions that we actually like don't help people figure things out I get what you mean um so the first thing that I'll ask is you know what do you get horny about second thing I'll ask is uh oftentimes people watch pornography and if they watch pornography what kind of pornography do you watch and then a really really um eye-opening question which I think you alluded to is even if you watch heterosexual porn which person do you identify with which often does oftentimes is very very like eye-opening for people um and usually those three questions like we kind of figure it out if people if the relationship is strong enough and they can be honest with themselves I mean that's kind of how you figure out um so you mentioned you kind of imagined yourself as the woman in sexual scenarios and then are there other kinds of things that sort of helped you figure out that you were androsexual um well I'm not too sure because it is kind of like what you said so um like I do just end those videos I take specifically the women or whatever and I do of course occasionally watch pornography um I'm probably not gonna like give you like the link to one but in general yeah I get that yeah that's why I just decided to say my piece instead of asking questions yes I know what you mean um but but the reason I ask is because I think imagining yourself as the woman is actually something like really really critical that no one talks about and just about every non-heterosexual or imagining yourself as the gender that you don't identify with is one of like the most eye-opening moments that I've seen with tons of people so I'm looking if there's any other nuggets like that that you've got I'd love to hear them yeah and I totally agree but um I'm not sure okay so it sounds like you just found dudes cute and things like that and then were there okay yeah I'm not gonna while I think it could be helpful we're if it's okay with you we'll not ask you anything else about pornography or what you find attractive it doesn't really matter to me okay so then let me ask you this I mean were there particular people that you sort of it's not just physical attraction right so was there like sort of a romantic um did you like Crush really hard on particular people or fall in love or anything like that middle school high school um I did with book characters interested in like fictional books um I don't I didn't really have any like guys I was like interested in until like early mid College um because something that actually helped me a lot was I used to be a competitive Smash Brothers player for four years in college and like 90 of Smash players are gay in some way so uh it's kind of an exaggeration but um there's definitely a lot of gay people in the competitive smash scene and so I just met a lot of people during that and that kind of helped me get things going if that makes sense sure and and can you tell us a little bit about what getting things going looks like um I just finally like found people I could potentially be interested in whether I was or not because like if you're in if you're like identify as a male and you like males and you like go out in public you can't really like look at people and think like oh I kind of like them because they're like more likely than not not going to be interested in you so you kind of have like your own internal checklist of like people that could be potential like partners and I'd never really had any until I went to the scene and realized oh there's a lot of people I could whether I want to or not there's still like an option I could put on this list and then yeah so and as it grows you find one they're like oh I think I'll act on this one okay so it sounds like you know being around other people um who were almost like more openly non-heterosexual or that you could have romantic relationships with like you know that they would cons conceivably be interested in you that that really helped you kind of like I don't know I guess cultivate or let those feelings out some I think it also helped that um not really anyone there was religious and I'd been in an extremely religious household and I still hadn't really internalized to myself that it was okay to like men and so seeing all them like date each other and all this kind of stuff it's kind of like oh this is like a normal thing they're normal people it's not as big of a deal as I thought it was it kind of encouraged me to act on it and I I'd love to hear actually a little bit about that what was it like to grow up religious and like think it was not okay to like men it might take me a minute to remember but um it was kind of just like I didn't necessarily think there was something wrong with me it just felt like oh this is my challenge I have to beat it if I want to go to heaven like that makes sense um and it was kind of like a what was the challenge that you had to beat um to not like men okay so so you kind of you knew you liked men and you thought that was something to overcome yeah yeah and how did you come to peace with that um just that same smash story so like okay meeting a bunch of friends that were openly intimate or women or the same sex gender um and realizing oh wait they're normal people it's not a big deal it's not like wrong like if that makes sense and is it okay if I ask um a little bit more about religion so it sounds like I'm guessing you identify with one of the Christian or abrahamic faiths I'm Protestant Christianity and and so um what is your understanding of of like going you mentioned you're religious right so is it okay if I ask you about your specific religious beliefs and how you kind of tie those things together with your sexuality and gender identity yeah although I do think it'd be better to clarify I'm more spiritual than religious I'm not like uh live by the Bible go to church but I do you know like I'm spiritual yeah sure so actually that that clarification is exactly what I'd I'd like to understand if that's okay so I mean you understand what you know what do you think about God having spirituality life being gay like how do those two things intersect for you sure so perfect and whatever and I think if the way I put it to myself is if gay is one of the worst things you can be in in God's eyes and that's the one thing I do wrong I'm already better than 90 of people that do all these horrible things are like uh one thing I've talked about with a bunch of therapists is that uh God never or I guess Jesus never disliked anybody he never hated anybody even if he was being crucified he said God forgive them uh I think there's a lot of people like famous bad people that probably would still even be in heaven if that makes sense because the god I was taught I think would have a hard time sending anyone to Hell really because he's if he's so loving I don't see why he would do that that that's a really interesting take you know I I think one of the most interesting things about religion and I think is true of any religion is that there's it's interesting how how easy it is to deviate from some of the precepts of what the actual like religious figures were saying right like he probably wasn't sending anyone to hell and just like you said yeah quite the opposite he was like you forgive them for they not know not what they do right like I I don't get why there's so many modern Christians that I know in my life that are like you're a horrible person get out of my church Jesus hates you like have you read the Bible like I don't think they know what they're talking about and and how do you how do you understand those people and how do you deal with them um I just ignore them and do you have a sense of what's going on in their head uh I mean I understand where they're coming from I definitely don't agree with it but um it's kind of their own thing it's not really up to me it's their battle they need to figure out and and can you help us understand where they're coming from or what what you understand about that uh well because I was kind of the same way because I was raised were in church they say uh these gay people are horrible they're going to hell they're infecting all of our youth and when you're raised being told that you're kind of like oh I guess it has to be true then because that's just what every important person in your life because my family is all like great people all like I liked my original Pastor as a kid I liked everyone in my church there's like this one thing they're like oh yeah it's just these people are bad like oh I guess they are okay I see so so I I'm once again Misty hearing a lot of uh a lot of respect from you I suppose like in the sense that you're sort of acknowledging that these are not evil people it's just you recognize that these are the circumstances that they were brought up in and so they were just taught to believe a particular thing and I'm not hearing you kind of demonize them for what they believe I can agree yeah I think that's rare I do too why do you think it's so rare because I think it's easier just to blame people and like if someone does something stupid just call them out on it what what makes it easier to blame people very clear in any way and then a bunch of people come up to you and start like harassing you I think it's pretty easy to say like oh they're just bad people they just started harassing me for no reason or um if on the other side if you're like uh race to think these people are horrible and then you see them quotes being horrible in public like oh hey you're doing bad things in public you shouldn't do that like it's just kind of human nature I guess sure how is it that you're able to not blame them personally for me yeah probably just a lot of experience because again I I've been dealing this for almost a decade now I've I'm sure I used to be like that were you probably I don't really remember hmm it sounds like your your family is good Christians yeah I like them like them like I'm noticing that you know like respect and love and and forgiveness was something that you were really raised with and I it's so interesting right because I I sometimes wonder about um kind of the fire and brimstone households and and even so you know one thing that's kind of confusing for a lot of people or meme worthy for a lot of people is that a lot of human beings who are very very anti-gay or anti-lgbtqia are actually engaging in homosexual activity themselves yeah I've noticed that and and so it's really interesting but there's a fascinating psychological theory of like reaction formation which is like so so what happens with these people is they're they grow up right they have these internal feelings like hey I have a penis fetish and then when you're when you're 16 or 17 and you've got a penis fetish and you ask your friends in the car much like you did like hey do any of you all sometimes have a penis fetish and everyone's like No And so you're taught to hate homosexuality what happens is as you as you're taught to hate that you start to hate a part of yourself and there's a very simple psychological mechanism called reaction formation which is that we demonize in other people the things that we hate about ourselves and so if I can like hate this other person a ton I can kind of redirect that from myself and I become okay on the inside because if it's unacceptable for me to be gay but I pile enough people that sort of like eliminates the the gayness within me it's kind of weird but I've had some experience with this but there's people who know a lot more about it than I do kind of explained that does that kind of make sense yeah I totally get what you're saying I've seen that before you guys I think it's very interesting how it just you know there's people who are very very anti-lgbtqia or anti-queer who are oftentimes engaging in queer kind of stuff um but anyway and and so uh anything that I we I know I've been kind of a little bit all over the place is there anything that I've asked about or that we've talked about that you wanted to share more about otherwise I've got questions uh not that I can recall no okay um can you tell us so you've shared a lot about a lot about your uh androsexual nature and what that experience is like and thank you so much for doing that can you tell us a little bit more about the Demi girl aspect and how you sort of discovered that yeah sure so I've never felt like the male genders just perfectly fit me I also don't think the female gender perfectly fits me either so that's why you go non-binary but uh I do kind of like more on the feminine side that just make more sense to me or like um I have talked to my mom in the past about hey just so you know I think I've might be transgender I decided against it but um still just kind of in that like Middle Ground so you know just like I I have she's one of my pronouns um along with they it's non-binary uh do a lot of feminine things like my nails and stuff which and most of gender and gender expression is solely based around conception and expression if that makes sense I think I said expression in both terms but you get what I mean can you please explain that yeah sure um so like in like the United States wearing a skirt is like an extremely like feminine thing like only people like female feminine genders do that whereas like if you look at like Celts in Scotland that could be like more of a masculine thing like it really depends on like your surroundings and what you are as to what your gender expression is it's like again I said I've said painting my nails is like a feminine thing only here like there's many places in the world painting your nails is like just like a gender neutral thing it really depends on like the stuff around you I think okay so I understand how it relates to expression can you help us understand what you mean by conception uh in which ways so like you said that gender identity relates to conception and expression so how do you conceive of yourself oh okay um yeah it's just kind of more of like what feels best to you internally and like how you want people to react to you if that makes sense so like if you want someone to like call you specific pronouns that could be a sign of a gender identity you don't have like again there's people that are completely like uh CIS heterosexual normal End quotes that uh still use different pronouns but they're very like plain like like having pronouns it doesn't necessarily mean your genders change if that makes sense sure but um and and so you said that you didn't really identify fully as masculine or feminine can you uh help me understand what the inter like how does that work like what do you feel what do you notice what do you think how does one know that they don't identify like what did that look like for you I think it's just solely based on um like just the typical the word like I guess stereotypes for males and females so like males are usually like big muscly like yet dirty like trucks or whatever is where I'm from and uh that's definitely not me and then girls are like love pretty dresses love princess movies get manicures and pedicures that's a little closer to me but not it's also not me so I think I'm a little more on that side which is where that's why I say Demi girl not just non-binary but um as a blanket term non-binary this means any gender that's not 100 male or 100 female or chat and and so what was like what was it like growing up for you like how did you know that you were not not how did you know you were non-binary um it's just kind of again kind of like a choice like you can express however you want and still be like a a cisgender like you can be a full male who likes Princess movies and Barbies like that's just how you can be it's just kind of a choice if you want to identify with it or not I don't think it necessarily means like oh if you do this you have to be this person I'm with you what I'm kind of curious about is like internally what were you feeling or thinking like when you were a boy or like a kid right did you think of yourself as a boy and when did that start to change um probably just the past few years honestly it's kind of new yeah so I'd love to hear about what that Journey was like if you can articulate it I realize it may be hard or impossible but yeah it's there's so many terms and they're still new to me as well it's kind of hard to work around them but um I think well as a kid I didn't even know other genders existed that's not something we were taught which is why I think there's been such a big boom in it recently is with the internet kids are learning more and more at younger ages like oh this is something you can be and then maybe that fits with them but um for me as I kind of started learning it I met a couple non-binary friends kind of like learned how stuff worked and eventually realized like I think this suits me more than anything else and I would be comfortable identifying with this if that makes sense and what are the features that kind of suit you or that feel more comfortable or appropriate I go by feeling okay so um like there's a lot of like online identity tests you can take and it'll be like oh you might be this person this thing and then sometimes you're like you know what that kind of feels right if that makes sense interesting okay so internet tests told you so you get kind of no but I mean I I can see how they can be useful at sort of helping you explore certain ideas or give you kind of a framework to think about things yeah yeah yeah um but I I wonder if I'm not articulating it myself the best it's not something I had to think through before no that that's totally cool I mean I think that as you mentioned I think you have a lot more experience or maybe that's not the right word but you've had a lot more time to sort through and navigate being intersexual than you have being a demi girl and so I'm sort of hearing that it's still kind of like a work in progress for you yes I can agree with them yeah so I think that makes sense and you know you don't have to give us perfect answers to everything that's even the even the Andrew sexual part has been so helpful and so enlightening well thank you I'm glad to hear that um I I know at the beginning you mentioned a lot of stuff about harassment and swatting and using an avatar uh are you interested in kind of talking more about that or I have some other like questions for you more about like General things like um gender identity related stuff I'm curious like what you think about things like conversion therapy what do you think would be a better use of our time uh whatever you think would be more helpful to people I'm fully down for um so let's start with like you know what's it like being a queer person in life and on the internet um in life I feel like it's not really a big deal in my experience like I feel like one of the big things online is that no one has a face everyone can hide behind a mask and do whatever they want whereas in person uh it's a lot more difficult for someone to like walk up and harass you but they definitely did they definitely still do it but I feel like it's a lot more frequent online because it's easier for them to do it okay um so like you can get a lot of hate comments or like people trying to like mock you or whatever and it's pretty easy just to like mute them so like on my YouTube channel I have a list of like 3 000 words that ends to block your comment if you like say them that kind of stuff is there can you give us example of those words without violating TOs [Music] is a lot yeah there's um I just Googled a bunch of lists people make for like common blocked words and just kind of compiled them all into one daughter list that's that sounds like a really useful resource yeah um and and so what's it like being kind of harassed on the internet um again I kind of just ignore it because I mean what can I really do if you try to talk back to someone that's harassing you it's only gonna make it worse like nine times out of ten maybe even 10 times out of 10. but um if you just ignore them they're clearly just looking for attention or to make some kind of reaction so if you don't give that to them it kind of just blows over in my experience at least okay does it hurt you when they say things like that uh sometimes it can but it's never like a big deal like I don't think it could ever like ruin my day or something it'd be like oh well that kind of sucks anyways goodbye and then I like remove them from my thing Misty you seem very grounded uh perhaps because I I mean I've worked with a lot of content creators I mean usually you know stuff gets under our skin pretty easily how that's so interesting I wonder if it kind of goes back to the way that you like just respect people so do you have a sense of like where that hatred is coming for from for them uh I assume it's the same thing I talked about with religion is that people just don't know there's a natural human fear of the unknown if you see something that's weird to you you're gonna make fun of it like nerdy kids in school typically get bullied the most because they're different than the others like um I think people just like to kind of like what you said and how if maybe they have a fear of themselves where like maybe they thought a guy was cute once and now they want to beat you up because they're mad at themselves like you never really know someone's story so if they do something stupid I'm just gonna hide them from my thing so I won't see him again something I actually learned you can do on Twitter is that I can only see notifications from people that do follow me which gets rid of like 90 of the harassment interesting okay I'm just wondering whether you know how common it is for people who harass queer personalities on the internet how many of them just secretly have penis fetishes inner dudes I think a very large margin something my counselor brought up is that there is I don't remember what study it was I couldn't link it to you but they said like the vast majority of the population is like bisexual in some percentage whether even if it's just 90 10 they'll just never admit it which I don't know how they tested that but it it kind of makes sense to me yeah so there there's some um that's that report that statistic I I don't know more recent stuff but there's there was a very famous sex researcher in the 60s named Kinsey and so Kinsey was one of the first people I don't even remember if it was a man or a woman but they released these things called the Kinsey reports which was really like a very very like qualitatively Rich exploration into human sexuality and what they basically did is like asked people like this was early on when people were just basically asking like what are you attracted to and stuff like that and so I think the kinsu reports are basically where that idea comes from that 90 of people are homosexual I mean by not 90 of people are not a hundred percent heterosexual yeah that sounds familiar too I think that's the right one I I think though that more rigorous and later research kind of shrinks that percentage down my my guess is that well over 50 of people are probably squarely in the heterosexual category there may be some lingering stuff there but I think based on some of the studies that I sort of encounter and think have better methodology we're talking about 10 to 20 of the population is probably um not cisgender and not heterosexual yeah but even still that's a large it's it's a huge it's a huge uh percent and then the other thing is that that seems to be growing so even this sort of idea that 10 of people are queer in some way that could have another um the numbers probably even higher so one of the things that we're seeing is that there's been a five-fold increase in the diagnosis of autism within the last 20 years now this doesn't mean that people are five times as autistic today as as they were 20 years ago although I'm sure there's a 4chan joke somewhere in there what it really is is that now that we're aware of stuff and we're looking for stuff and we're able to pick it up we are getting closer to the the true number out there so I suspect that's what's going on with people being queer and then the other kind of yeah the other kind of interesting thing is that since the numbers on the rise this is why I think that a lot of people are like oh my God Misty is infecting people with the queer virus and is turning people queer they caught me and I think it's just the same reason that autism I mean autism isn't infectious it's just our increased awareness in space for this kind of stuff causes an increase in diagnosis you get the increase in diagnosis doesn't mean that the actual condition is increasing that just means we're detecting it more Faithfully yeah and I think also something that helped was pretty much everything's defined as a spectrum now whereas I feel like even however many years ago every a lot of stuff was binary so it's like you're straight or gay there's no in between and now there's a lot of in between things and people are like oh I think I actually am maybe in between or something yeah and that causes more people to identify with him kind of makes sense the the the more thing the more questions that you turn from true false into like essay the more variability you're gonna get in the answer um yeah so so uh Misty let me just think for a second I had a couple other questions um I had something that I wanted to ask you but I just blanked um oh yeah so so do you have any thoughts about gender dysphoria and the relationship between gender dysphoria and being queer you mean I'm not sure I'd be the best person to talk with sure because I'm still working through that myself but uh I do think that is something that needs talked about okay that's fair enough I I it was just thank you how much I could help with them no that's totally cool because I'm not hearing that there was that you experienced a whole lot of dysphoria uh kind of depends on the situation can you help us understand that a little bit um let me think for a second okay well I am still working through it how about maybe in the future I can come back and give you a better answer absolutely this is where I I think you've already shared so much I was just curious because I think something that even I struggle to understand is so we know that there's for example a a diagnosis for gender identity disorder which is primarily characterized by dysphoria and there's um you know a lot of emerging research so I don't know that we have 100 clear answers yet that generally speaking people who are queer are are more prone to things like suicidal thoughts and even completed suicide and there are some studies that show that gender affirming care uh is beneficial to people but I think the research is still being done and we're not 100 sure and it depends on the methodology of the study you know the stuff is relatively new and I was just really curious if you had had personal experiences of that that you could share that could help us understand from you know an individual perspective as opposed to a research perspective but I totally get that that's not something that you've dealt a whole lot with or don't really have a whole lot you know that hasn't been your experience yeah yeah totally um I could say probably that I do obviously know a lot of queer people or like trans people or people that have had gender dysphoria in any way and uh I'm not saying this is true for every case but from what I've heard from all them is that all of the self-harm and suicides that have happened have been related towards the bullying and harassment and not necessarily their own gender identity if that makes sense yeah absolutely so so it's it's because of the way that they're treated instead of who they are or the way they feel from what I understand from what people have told me sure so I get that that's anecdotal and I appreciate you kind of adding that caveat but that's that's of course useful and I think you know one day we'd like to talk to someone like that um and so growing up I'm so I was just I've been thinking about conversion therapy kind of in the back of my mind simply because you grew up in kind of a Protestant uh you know situation was that something that um was prevalent or anything that you kind of dealt with or saw or anything like that uh I mean I've definitely heard like pray the gay away but I've never like been sat in the electric chair thing or whatever The Stereotype is for conversion therapy um can you help us understand how prey the gay way is supposed to work uh again like I said before um I like thought that when I was younger and Christian I needed to not be gay it was a challenge I had to overcome and so I thought just like enough like prayer and time and stuff would get rid of that of course it didn't that's not really how that works but um so it sounds like you tried to pray the gay way yes I did and can you tell us what that looked like uh I mean just like your daily prayers like please fix me please get rid of this whatever so you consider it something wrong in yourself sure kind of like a disease like heal me whatever okay yeah that's actually very helpful Misty thank you because I I think a lot of times people you know because I imagine there are people out there who are going to be doing that every day where they pray to God or pray to Jesus or pray to whoever their God of choices to fix them heal them make them different you know yeah I agree please take the the penis fetish out of my mind um so maybe I might start saying that instead of Andrew sexual say I just have a penis fetish yeah I just I'm sorry I keep bringing it up it's just no it's funny like it's got to be one of the case the the biggest cases of mental gymnastics that I've ever seen wow that's some real interesting cognitive you know distortions there or bendiness but um cool I mean do you want to talk about uh harassment and being misgendered swatting uh sure we can um so go for it uh I think misgendering is probably the quickest one okay um it's definitely hard to get people to do what makes you happy like of course a big thing with uh trans people in the media right now are like Bud Light kind of stuff that spokesperson is that everyone wants to like just harass them let them know you are not who you say you are you are who we're telling you you are we're not going to call you your pronouns Etc so like getting people to try and use that is very difficult and obviously you can't force everyone to do it but um it's just kind of hard to tell people it's like sometimes my friends will like make a mistake and call me the wrong thing and it's difficult to like mention like hey uh just so you know you said this it'd make me feel better if you said this one instead and they're usually like oh okay sure I'm very sorry I didn't mean to but there's always some people that are like yeah what's she gonna do about it and then that's kind of hard to deal with how do you deal with that um I don't think you really can because like I said a second ago you can't really force people to do anything and like people are always going to do what they feel is right and if they don't respect your pronouns they're not going to use them you there's nothing you can do to make them use that so I would just not talk to that person anymore if that makes sense yeah sorry I mean it sounds like you're not out there trying to convince people and you're sort of like I'm really noticing how well you uh navigate towards some people in in life and how quickly you're okay navigating away from other people yeah I think that's very important for people that get misgendered I mean I think it's important for everyone yeah I think one of the most under appreciated skills we have is Letting Go of convincing people that they're wrong so much of the mental anguish that I hear from people is like when someone is wrong people who try to convince them otherwise will spend so much time in wasted effort and just letting people believe what they want to believe whether it's right or wrong and kind of going about your day is like so good for your mental because even I guess one of the ways I see it is even if you can prove this person wrong and like they will have to do what you say uh being wrong makes people angry so even if you can prove them wrong they're now going to be angry so no matter what you do it's a lose-lose situation so just don't bother yeah so even if you win you end up losing yeah yeah I'd agree completely I think one of the biggest things to remember is that I think we we think a lot about convincing people but I sort of think about it as like help people understand and if they're not open-minded or willing to understand then that's on them right I'm not going to spend all the time sort of trying to convince them and so really think about you know is this person willing to be open-minded and if the answer is no stop wasting your breath and then if alternatively they could be going after you it's not even you doing anything like uh maybe someone like DMS me on Twitter like you are a man you are a he blah blah blah like they're going out of their way to me I can just mute them or in person you can just kind of try to walk away and hopefully nothing gets worse that's a little more difficult in person but um I think both ways whether you're trying to tell someone they're misgendering you or they're coming after you I think you just need to reassess the situation that makes sense absolutely so Misty I'm kind of curious I've got a question for you I was hoping for your guidance with something sure so we try to have conversations with people and try to understand their like experience of being human and kind of where they're coming from we try to do that in a relatively non-judgmental manner I'm not saying that judgment we sometimes are judgmental and I think judgment actually has a place but to be judgmental with compassion I get what you mean um so one of the things that I personally have struggled a lot with is is this idea of like platforming someone versus like understanding them so in in my heart of hearts and also as in my clinical experience as a psychiatrist it's kind of interesting because when I tell people like yeah I worked in a jail for three months everyone's like wow like you must be a good human being and then if we ever like talk about you know interviewing someone who has let's say very like anti or has a perspective on on homosexuality that is like anti or whatever that people are talking to that person is like off limits so do you have a sense and I personally struggle with this because I think that the way that we bring people together is actually through dialogue like that's just my personal ethos I'm not saying that that's objectively correct and I think that ostracizing or canceling particular people can be very effective but would you have thoughts about like let's say we got the opposite of you let's say how would you feel about us doing an interview with someone like that uh I I don't know if I'd say I'd love to but I think it'd be worth it like I don't think it'd be a fun conversation but I think it's worth the effort if that makes sense yeah I mean would you what do you think about the potential harm of platforming someone who could say damaging things I think as long as both sides are platformed equally and people can kind of like form their own opinions based on it like I feel like you have one person saying like hey I'm a normal person I like the same gender that's it and then someone else like yelling and like spitting out of their mouth like you're disgusting I hate you I feel like most people would kind of just realize one side might not be as bad as the other but I guess that's a little bit hopeful but I think just in general I I do think there's obviously nothing wrong with any uh queer uh identities so I feel like in any argument like that uh most people would probably realize like oh it's not as bad as I thought it was because that's what my experience was in Smash like I used to think uh like being gay was like a bad thing and I needed fixed and then I met all these people that were just normal people and I was like oh it's not what I thought it was so I think even if you did have someone horribly against it as long as you also have someone like very for it and they kind of clash I feel like a lot of people would kind of like understand the issues better rather than just hearing only one side if that makes sense okay yeah so and that that's it's good to hear thank you so much for sharing that like I think for me it's not even so much about sides although I totally get that that's an important aspect because I don't yeah I don't even really think about it as an argument I I mean I know that it exists that but the way that I approach it is just like understanding and and I've worked with a lot of people who I think could be described as bigoted or evil or you know terrible human beings and like that's just part of what we do as medical doctors is like we try to engage with everyone um and it's it's part of you know the the oath that you take when you start med school and the oath that you take when you graduate about sort of like treating people equally um but I I'm I'm a little bit concerned about navigating that issue I'm happy to talk to pretty much anyone about anything but I I think that there's I've come to understand and realize and appreciate that having a conversation with people can have in fact this whole HG thing is about the far-reaching impacts of a single conversation yeah I totally get what you're saying like if you get someone who's like very against it and then you make this video it gives a bunch of views now you're just showing all these things this person's saying that could negatively affect people but um sorry about to say something no no go ahead um I definitely think it's still good though to hear their sides because like assuming they are just wrong you can't really just say oh well that person's wrong like you kind of need to understand why they're wrong if that makes sense so I think as long as you could say like hey this person said these things just want to let you know it's not fully true or this evidence counteracts that or whatever I feel like that's fine I guess I don't know it's like I'm not really a single person in a place to judge how that should work if that makes sense yeah and that's the problem that I face is that yeah I am not that person either so I'm I'm trying to figure it out right because the other thing that's kind of interesting is sometimes we'll like push back on people that we talk to but you know it's not part of it's not my job to well I mean sometimes I rep I always represent of you actually but I I you know generally speaking when people come on and they say something that I disagree with it's not like my place to disagree with them if that kind of makes sense I'm not I'm not holding either side of the argument I have my own biases and Views but we're really really tough yeah thank you very much for offering your perspective though it certainly helps me and I I get that you're not speaking for the queer people right you're not like the president who's been elected to represent them and that there's I'm sure there's a whole diversity of opinions there but it really helps me to understand that and hear that from you thank you um yeah I mean that's kind of like what I really appreciate everything we've talked about today that's sort of like everything that I wanted to talk about um are there other things that you sort of wanted to mention or share uh I think we've got pretty much everything I wanted to get across okay um and how do you feel about our conversation today I've enjoyed it love spending time with you nice to have a little Dr K in my corner that talks back to me for once uh I'm confused by that what do you mean by talks back to you watched your videos for a few years and so oh have you respond to me is an interesting feeling and is there anything that you would have wanted to ask Dr K that because I'm here now so I can respond um well I assume we just did and pretty much because like I said I always wish there was like that video that I needed a few years ago I feel like we've at least started on that yeah so so I get so let me ask in a different way Misty I feel like so far the conversation that we've had is not for you it's for everybody who's watching and it's for me is there any conversation that you want to have that's more for you um I mean we could though I'm already in the process of working with uh specific LGBT counselor but um yeah so if it's counseling stuff I'd say stick with that yeah I'd definitely be down to a comeback in the future though maybe if I've learned a little more had some more experience absolutely so if there's something that you want to talk about um or something that you want to share like that sounds fantastic awesome um so just a couple of other thoughts before we wrap up so first of all uh how do I learn how to get good at smash like do you have any recommendations uh well I wouldn't call myself good compared to other players but um just a lot of time if you want to get good at smash find your local scene just show up someone will teach you something you'll get better there okay a local scene okay I did not know that those existed but I imagine they do yeah okay and uh any character recommendations for noobs um I don't play ultimate I played Smash 4 and now I play melee but typically if you just like look up what characters are popular and then see how many moves they use if you find like a popular character that uses only like three or four good moves they're probably pretty easy to learn nice so find people that have an OP move and just be like a a one one button Masher I try to play Bowser Donkey Kong Bow's just good character to start um Heavy's Grapplers I don't know about ultimate in Smash 4 they were both pretty good I think okay good to know and then just to kind of wrap up what I'd love to do is just share with you kind of what I understood as your process of coming out yeah and um and I think what I'll focus on a little bit more is the andrewsexual side so here's what I'm kind of understanding okay so the first thing is that sign number one is you had five girlfriends before you hit puberty right and because I can really even call them that at that age I I mean I'm sure that you're you're at the time your fellow Bros were jealous that there was probably there was this Mega Chad Misty and and this this dude can get more chicks and he's not even a dude um and and so I really do Wonder a little bit about like whether it was like the weather sort of being impervious to that sexual attraction or Romanticism even at a young age it actually correlates with being uh queer in some way and then sort of what happened is you noticed that like you actually started to identify with like kind of romantic feelings or and not maybe that's a strong word but you thought that fictional characters that were men were like pretty cute right and it's not necessarily that you had to be attracted to someone in real life and also that part of the the challenge kind of for you growing up in real life is that like even if you were attracted to someone there's a strong strong strong possibility that they would not be attracted back so you kind of like keep that on the DL is that fair yeah um and that one of the ways that you sort of discovered that you were Andrew sexual or and at the time you sounded like you still identified as a man so we're gay um was sort of even when you were sort of thinking about heterosexual scenarios so sex between a man and a woman you sort of identified with the woman correct and then you started to kind of notice that hey like I kind of think some guys are cute and then you kind of told your buddies was it in high school that like hey you know isn't it what what exactly did you say can you tell us that again it was something like I just kind of mentioned it casually as if everyone had it and they kind of looked at me confused and were like what are you talking about and what did you mention again I love the way that you phrased it I don't it was something like [Music] um like don't you guys ever feel weird like when you're like attracted to like a random guy and they're like what yeah and so you kind of dip your toe in the water and then discover oh actually this may not be an experience that's shared um and then when it comes to so once you sort of figured it out then I think that there was a the process of coming out first of all was not binary that there was a lot of like baked in paranoia that a lot of the things that you were thinking about doing you had to be like extra careful and I love the way that you described being a spy in your own life right like you're some secret agent and no one can know so you can't use dating apps you can't do this you can't let anyone know um and that you sort of eased into it and made it easy for people to sort of like accept you you kind of like started by an excuse for like every step forward so you started painting your nails when you were doing a cosplay and then you kind of kept on doing it at the very beginning you like you had a acceptable reason and then it sort of continued yeah for sure it also sounds like you also kind of displayed certain stereotypical characteristics which felt uh consistent with who you are your voice kind of started to raise you had flamboyant mannerisms and what I'm sort of hearing is that you didn't hold that back that stuff back the way that you used to when you were a spy yeah well I did fully do it with friends but then in family I definitely like reserve like show no emotion like stoic kind of sit there and then I just kind of eased into it over time that makes sense yeah and then it sounds like the process of coming out was also a process in terms of you started with the most important people first and you didn't want and you wanted them to hear it from you um that you literally practiced your language and worked through some of your emotions with a counselor in your case but that you sort of like really like practiced what to say and really got centered before you said anything yeah for sure and I would like to reiterate if we are recapping that I definitely think one of the best things you can do is make sure you do keep respect for them and say like I don't want to hurt you I don't want to offend you but this is who I am this is who I've always been Etc as we've mentioned yeah I was going to end with that but I think that's actually the most important thing and I love that you articulated it that way which is that you know the process of coming out especially if you've got religious parents and things like that can be so contentious and doing your best to preserve respect towards them I think Garner is the same in return right because if you come out guns blazing like they're going to respond very defensively um and I think the the last thing to just mention is that as you mentioned in a lot of ways you're really grateful for your family and your experiences and you know people's mileage may vary like if people other people who are growing up with Protestant Christians or you know Southern Baptists or even other religions whether they be Hindu or Muslim or whatever that some people may not be so lucky I agree yes and so everyone should kind of take it their way mm-hmm last thing is that it sounds like really joining a community was a big part of you feeling confident and grounded and in your case it was the smash Community but I guess as you said 90 of them are queer yeah [Laughter] so I guess that explains maybe why I haven't played smash up until this point but hey I'm starting my journey now um yeah I definitely think joining Community was one of the best things for me yeah absolutely so anything um else that you want to say before we wrap up for the day Misty uh I don't think so but it's been nice talking to you it's been nice being here I'm glad I could hopefully help some people even if it's just a couple yeah hopefully I didn't ruin anyone else's experience but say something wrong yeah I I I I hope so too you know I think that's we're here to listen to people's experiences of life so thank you very much for sharing yours and hopefully it's educational or helpful to people who are listening and good luck to you Mr Cat uh enjoy the rest of pride month anything else can you tell us a little bit about where we can find you and and what to expect and what kind of content you're going to be doing yeah sure so um my name is Mr Cat it's like mystical but with a t um I do a lot of weird Minecraft stuff so if you've ever seen like making a circle in Minecraft or Etc I I try to make a bunch of weird stuff and uh push the limits of the game but I missed a cat or missed a cat live on all platforms I mostly just do YouTube though that's about it cool thank you very much and are you gonna be anything in particular you're doing for pride month or just kind of just streaming and doing your standard thing Play The Pride Minecraft championship what was that how does that work what is a Minecraft championship uh so it's a tournament organized by Knox crew who've been making Minecraft tournaments for like 11 12 years now and um this month specifically a pride one so they tried to get a bunch of uh queer creators in and only have them on the teams so but how do you compete in Minecraft how do you have a tournament is in the sandbox though um yeah that's why is that you can make a bunch of different games of anything so it's kind of like fall guys like maybe you have some PVP games maybe you have some Parkour maybe you have some like weird quirky games you get some building games and then you just get points and then it adds up and then there's a winner oh interesting okay so so that that's really fascinating cool well thank you so much for coming on today Mr Cat I really appreciate it and um you know if you have other stuff you want to share down the road please let us know of course take care all right you too bye okay so thoughts questions what on Earth tree punching okay so I I you know I saw there was a comment about HG is woke now I mean I don't know that we're woke but we're not we're just here to talk to people about their experiences of life and I'm sure we have a bias right because like I'm a human being and like I have a brain and that means that I have a bias but I I don't know if you all remember but we did an interview epic interview one of my favorite interviews of all time with Jimmy from Philly who was a a very proud Trump supporter and this is where you know I think Mr Cat said like as long as you kind of represent both sides of the argument like I I'm not even really interested in that um but what I really am interested in is helping human beings understand other human beings and that's what we're about I'm sure that at times we have beliefs that will align with like particular groups political philosophies like whatever like that's gonna happen right so for example we think that science is a good thing and we think that like medical treatment is a good thing like we we believe that right that but there are people out there that don't believe that and that are kind of anti-sides and like that's okay we're actually okay talking to those people too we absolutely have our own beliefs but the really core part of what we try to do here at HG is AOE healing and it's to recognize that human beings out there today are suffering irrespective of what their political beliefs are whether they're queer whether they're straight like whatever people are suffering and what really targeted what we're focused on is to help alleviate that suffering and one of the things that I think is really challenging right is that so we talk about how we're woke well we've also like interviewed our fair share of insults and there's tons of in cells in our community and oftentimes woke people are over here and in cells are over here and what it comes down to we're not Pro or anti-either of those things what we're for is like human beings because the one thing I've learned as a psychiatrist is that working in jails and working with people who are like you know have ankle bracelets and working with people who are addicts and working with CEOs and working with heads of state and working with like all these kinds of people like people are just people and what I think really like screws the world is when we stop treating people as people and we start treating them based on some identifiable thing and I thought Mr Cat said this really well that it's easier to blame than it is to understand so much easier to blame than to understand right so for people who think that we're woke or we're platforming someone right so this is also something where it's like we don't want to just talk to people of a particular belief system identification atheist religious whatever we want to talk to everybody because I think it's really important we've seen this in our own Community especially when it comes to gender Dynamics where it's like are the HG Community is a place where Echo Chambers collide and that's really challenging it's a it's it's very choppy Waters at times and our mod team is fantastic we've like constricted a lot of these dating and gender Dynamics posts to Friday but these are discussions that need to be had we can't keep separating ourselves on the internet like this is bizarre we have so much connection and we're the most isolated we've ever been why is that it's because we don't talk to people we just don't talk to people we isolate ourselves we cancel other people and I'm not like anti-cancel culture that's where like anything I say I'm Gonna Get bucketed Right so I think if someone is part of cancel culture is just like consequences for actions it's karma at the same time I think just dialogue is like what we're all about and there may be absolutely situations in which even dialogue is not appropriate I'm not saying that but I think that with the way that the internet and Human Society is evolving today a little bit more dialogue and a little bit more understanding and a little bit more listening is a step in the right direction and that's something that I can absolutely get behind and so I'm grateful to everyone in this community even those of y'all that hate other people in the community I'm grateful to all of y'all for being here and sharing your perspective but the one thing that I ask of everyone who's here today is that in addition to sharing please try to listen to what other people are sharing as well and recognize that human beings have varied experiences and I want to share just one really simple story for you early on I was an intern so fresh out of med school I was seeing a patient in the emergency room and they told me that their parent had just passed away and I said I'm so sorry for your loss and they looked at me like I was Medusa and they said my parent had been physically abusive my entire life when they passed away a week ago it was the most relieving thing I've ever experienced and I was like holy crap that never crossed my mind we assume that all parents are good parents and everyone misses their parents when they die because it's very common right but what I learned that day is that everyone's experience of life is different and just because your life existed a particular way does not mean that other people's lives existed that way and why do we assume this stuff because we don't hear or listen the other the experiences of other people's lives and that's what we're here to combat and we think that bringing the world and the internet together happens through dialogue and listening and I've seen actually horror stories of people even working with therapists and the therapist will Advocate very hard based on their value system that their patient should repair the relationship with their with their parents right because you only get one mom and dad and you'll regret it after you die but that even therapists we can impose our own value system on our patients and that can be a mistake that's the case of a therapist and not listening and I've been guilty of that I just shared an example so it's not like I'm better than any of them this is what I've learned is that I've got to be super careful and I tried really hard to recognize that other human beings are different and I strongly encourage you all to as well I mean half the internet is trying to convince the other half of the internet they're wrong right why are we losing this game of DOTA this is game of valorant it's because you're a noob and what's that person doing we're losing because you're a noob and what happens to both of those players they lose the game they cue back up and then they tank another game which is why they're bronze which players climb the ones that actually listen to other people because hey if you're in bronze chances are you're making a mistake and it's possible that your team members are aware of what mistakes you're making and this is happening not only in every single game that has matchmaking right which is why people will pay 10 play 10 000 hours and be hard stuck at bronze it's happening on the internet as a whole or instead of trying to understand why someone disagrees with me I'm going to convince them that I am right and to be blunt like what brought me from failing out of college to like teaching at Harvard Medical School was in wreck in trying to learn not in assuming that I'm right but recognizing hey where could I be wrong and the one thing that I got so the interesting thing is that I got one piece of very positive feedback from my program directors when I was becoming a psychiatrist and there that they said that your best strength is that you take feedback well when people tell you you're doing something wrong you listen that was the one thing that I was asked here in everything else TBH chat I'm kind of like average there were people who were way smarter way more hard-working like people who were like I was like I was bronzed here who somehow got like recalibrated to Diamond but the one thing that I did well is learn from my mistakes and even when I didn't think I made mistakes I started to ask myself what I could do better that was the one thing I was good at TBH and that's how you go from like failing to the top is correcting your mistakes and what I'm seeing on the internet as a whole with all this woke anti-woke whatever is like no one is stopping to think about like what can I do better everyone's thinking about what everyone else is doing wrong which is why the whole world is stuck at bronze we're not getting better we're moving in the opposite direction do you all get that mental illness is in crisis we're at the highest level of depression anxiety suicide's been pretty stable actually it's a little bit getting a little bit worse the number one cause of death for Asian Kids In America between the ages of 18 and 24 is suicide for non-asian kids it's accidents in the most dangerous thing for an Asian kid is themselves and why is that it's because their parents teach them to protect themselves from the rest of the world right so they have fewer accidents but they're a danger to themselves why because when an Asian kid says hey I'm struggling hey life is hard people don't listen Neuroscience research is in an all-time high translation of Neuroscience research we've got Chads like Sam Harris and Andrew huberman who are taking so much neuroscience and translating it to the public we've got so many people like Dr Romani and brene brown and like all these amazing human beings who are sharing so much information science is at an all-time high we're like making breakthroughs with Quantum Computing Human Society is progressing and mental health is getting worse why every other dimension of medicine we are just leveling up and I want you all to think about this you can take a heart out of a human being's body and stick a different one in there there are even cases of people putting pig hearts into humans and that humans staying alive for a while this is how far science has come we've got ECMO for your lungs cardiac bypass for your heart dialysis for your kidneys ECMO is extracorporeal membrane membranous oxygenation we've got a device that can breathe for you a device that can pump blood through your body a device that can clean your bloodstream like your kidneys and mental illness is getting worse why if science is getting better shouldn't mental illness be being getting better it's because we've stopped listening we've stopped trying to understand and the Judgment in the world is in an astronomical High if you're an incel it's your fault if you're red pill you're woke I mean you're not woke you're an ass if you're woke you're everything that's destroying everything right it's just judgment it doesn't matter who you are you get judged no one's trying to understand what is your experience of life in my personal experience of working with people who are quote unquote red pillars most common thing is trauma what kind of trauma trauma inflicted by a woman but we never think of it that way we never stop to listen and I'm not like Pro red pill or anything like that I just think we should listen to human beings and that's how you bring people back on the path and if you guys if you all disagree I'm here to listen by all means tell me I'm wrong tell me that hey like I'm I'm here to listen I'm sharing with you what I believe Alyssa is asking is this guy a doctor yeah last time I checked I'm a psychiatrist for those of you all that don't know yes so tell me something interesting recently so when we started when I started streaming four years ago it was like I was pretty clear like I mentioned a lot that I was a doctor and that I was a psychiatrist and now apparently like we've grown so much that like we we stopped sharing the lore like a couple years ago right because how I mean you stop just hey hello hello Chad I am I look I am doctor baby look at how good I am I know so much I'm so cool and so we stopped doing that and now what I understand someone told me this recently it's like people just think you're a random guy who's talking about stuff which is honestly what I am right like even doctors are random dudes or random women or random non-binary and by the way the a the last time I checked an lgbtqia is asexual Maybe I'm Wrong maybe it's androgynous who knows that's what I thought it was um yeah Dr K versus Dr disrespect let's go I'm down is a cool dude I think I just I've seen a couple clips of him um cool Okay so uh thank you all very much for coming today we've got a couple of cool YouTube videos coming out um we're doing a lot of new things FYI so here's a last thing I want to share with you all so I'm going to just give you all a list of topics that I'm planning on doing stuff about okay so brain rot potentially penis dysmorphia some stuff around male mental health deep dives into somatic illness um eating disorders um pmdd so the under understanding the connections between uh menstruation female hormones and mental health these are all topics that we're kind of considering tinnitus is another one so if you guys have other topics you know a great way that we oh another one that I just saw today from our subreddit was like is it too late to start so I I'm I'm thinking about I'm trying to build a video about or a lecture or something about uh how to start late in life and catch up um and so that's another one oh I also want to do something about boredom super hyped about boredom so like understanding the science of boredom and how to conquer boredom so these are topics that we've got and just like mysticat kind of said you know we have deficiencies in the topics that we cover and how we decide is based on y'all and so a lot of people this is just another aside so there are also certain things that we've built that are sort of like very carefully packaged and very efficient at covering certain topics so we actually don't quarrel cover a lot of core topics anymore like depression anxiety meditation and ADHD we've got YouTube videos and stuff so y'all can search for that and I'm not saying we're not going to do it again but generally speaking one of the things that we've realized is that like rather than making the same video like 10 times in a row that's why we built things like Dr K's guide so if you guys want like a start to finish sort of exploration of depression both clinical and non-clinical and then people may Wonder well what do you mean by non-clinical depression where it's like yeah so sometimes when people come into my office and they say I'm depressed they're not mentally ill their life is lacking something very very important and so that's what we're gonna help you understand so sort of the spirituality or the existential approach to depression is also in Dr K's guided depression which is not necessarily a treatment approach there's a lot of stuff about treatment and complementary alternative medicine and medications and pharmacology so for those four topics for meditation ADHD anxiety and depression what I try to do is mimic when someone comes to my office and says Dr K I want to learn how to meditate what are all the things that I teach that person when someone comes into my office and says Dr K I have ADHD or I think I have ADHD how do I work with that person because a lot of it is going to be clinical understanding but then a lot of what I do with people who I'm helping is understanding how can you get organized where does motivation come from so the ADHD guide is also our guide to doing stuff so how can we translate everything that I know from like yoga and meditation and studying and ashrams in India and South Korea and Japan for like seven years and everything that I learned at places like Harvard Medical School put together and we will teach you how to do stuff and so if y'all are interested in a lot of that and you're looking for more something that's like more comprehensive and applicable instead of a one-off definitely check those out and for the rest of the stuff this is what we've got on Deck and y'all let us know if you want us to cover something else yeah so female hormones in the menstrual cycle is like a big thing that we're gonna do okay any chance you all will cover asexuality absolutely it's just an issue of sequencing um Dr k please do one on routines organization discipline and whether it's overrated so that's sprinkled throughout a lot of stuff we also have resource packs which I'm not sure if you all are aware of those are kind of like uh collections of videos with worksheets and exercises um and then a lot of the stuff that you're talking about about routine organization and discipline that's in the guide to doing stuff so just so you all know the guide to doing stuff is like 50 bigger than any of the other guides because we go into so much so many like high-yield topics about motivation and organization how to cry ah good thank you burpes okay um oh I got a 130 donation thank you so much Hugo uh thanks for all your work have you covered oversleeping I'm I'm tired all the time and sleep around noon every other day sleep so we have videos on insomnia but we can absolutely do a deep dive into sleep ah Loris is saying can you do something about bullying we have videos on bullying but we we also have something in the works around scapegoating so a lot of bullying actually has to do with scapegoating okay uh the resource packs are free the guides are not and just a reminder just about in general so first of all we try to make as much stuff as accessible as possible there was a post recently where someone was like wait Dr K's guide isn't a subscription it's like yeah we're one of the few dumbasses on the internet who like doesn't do subscriptions yet right like we're because we try to make it accessible second thing is um it helps us a lot if y'all donate if you guys share stuff like if you share our videos if you watch our videos if you like if you comment all that kind of stuff helps us so even if you all are not in a place to financially support us um you know anything that y'all do in that vein whether it's subscribing or sharing or whatever like that all actually helps in some way and then for some of our things that come at a price like we're very very grateful for for to everyone who has bought things like Dr K's guide or signed up for coaching because all of that Capital you know we've never taken an outside investment or anything like that and the reason is because you all are you all support us and as long as you all keep on supporting us whether it's donations subscribing sharing or trying out Dr K's guide or whatever like we build it to help you and then we take that money and then we use it to build additional stuff so we took the the proceeds from the first three guides and used it to build a fourth guide and use it to do things like we have researchers for example that will help me with research so that I can produce more high quality videos quicker um and so we're grateful for anything that you all can provide and and no big deal if y'all are not in a good financial situation we're still here for y'all and we're going to do our best that's also where a lot of people um need to remember that we've got an awesome Discord and the Discord by the way has like grown immensely so even for a lot of these things like accountability there's like a fitness Discord and the cool thing about the fitness part of the Discord is that the people there are like people from our community so the the fitness leads on our Discord are very aware of psychological challenges to getting fit and so they really really help people they meet people where they're at and they really help them because a lot of Fitness is not just about physical routine right which there's tons of videos and you can see like blog posts about like work out this way and do this kind of thing and and like you know wiggle your right toe when you're doing push-ups and if you wiggle your right toe it'll contract this muscle and increase your fat burn and take this supplement there's all that kind of crap out there but what I really appreciate about the people on our Discord is whether it's entrepreneurship or Fitness they recognize that the mental struggle is real and they'll try to help you all with that um appreciate all you do and give heart any advice videos for healthy parenting as a gamer so it's funny you should ask this is what I will say we are actually going to start a whole YouTube channel I think I hope fingers crossed on parenting so stay tuned to that we just revamped our course about how to raise uh parenting for like video game addiction and like how to Be an Effective parent this is something that I sort of have a lot of personal experience with so we combine a lot of science with my own experiences of upbringing of parents who loved me a lot but like didn't know how to teach me discipline as well as my own experiences of having two kids so absolutely um and we have a Facebook group for parents as well which you know plus minus yeah so that's the other thing it's like you know what our biggest problem is is we do a lot of stuff that no one has any clue about um so so that that's why we strongly like okay so chat we need Joel's help we are doing cool things and no one knows I literally met with our whole mod team yesterday and they're like no one knows about all the cool crap we're doing and I was like okay I'm gonna try to help with that so if you guys discover something cool that we are doing please let other people know because this whole this whole this whole operation is like not Dr K okay I may have the information but we need y'all's help in like disseminating it and sharing it with other people and huge shout out to everyone on our subreddit and Discord and all these other places where someone will ask a question hey I have this problem and someone will also be like hey have you seen this video huge shout out to y'all y'all are doing God's work uh Ronaldo is saying do you have anything related to dating trauma wounded people yes we have a whole video about how to date someone with BPD we also have a trauma Deep dive both of which I would recommend you watch yes we have those things people tell us that so some people say that the the trauma video in particular is like one of the best things that we've ever produced it's also one of the lectures that I feel the most proud of I think it's one of the top three lectures that I've given ever since I started streaming and there have been hundreds the BPD one I made because I love people with BPD and I love working with them and they get a they get a bad rap people with trauma get so demonized on the internet and in our media and everyone's like oh my God this person has a personality disorder as a narcissist has BPD has a history of trauma should I break up with them and no one ever tells us how to successfully have a relationship with those people which is sad because like they're good people right they just the way that they relate to other people what they've been taught about what a healthy relationship is or how a relationship is supposed to work is so screwed up but that's not their fault that's because of the way that they were raised and they deserve love and good relationships just as much as any of the rest of us have you heard of 48 Laws of Power yeah it's a great book I think it's not quite as applicable but it's fun to read can someone make a list of all the cool things this channel does I wasn't listening the last five minutes we'll try oh yeah avoidant personality disorder shyness social anxiety that's another deep dive we're looking into it's on our list here's why trauma so common absolutely that's our core trauma video ooh libido income libido incompatibilities love it what I would love to do about that is not just a video about it but that's something where I think an interview would be dope let's talk to both Partners about libido and incompatibility okay um is it possible to get people to listen better and be more understanding yeah so you guys should watch our communication webinar the parents in our community say that it's been absolutely eye-opening it is one of the most scuffed videos that we have ever produced this was back before we were cool and this is what like Dr K ordered a 30 camera from Amazon was streaming from a laptop during the pandemic in an empty room when I was staying at someone else's house I had a foldable picnic table a camera and a Yeti mic and we did arguably some people say well also one of our like top three lectures which is so scuffed but apparently is the best people have said that it's like revolutionary for helping them communicate it's also one but the problem with that video is that like 30 of people who watch it have no idea what I'm saying so the big irony is it is a poorly communicated video on communication where if you get it it's revolutionary but like a third of people I just do such a bad job at teaching that they don't understand what I'm saying highly sensitive people we have a video on rejection sensitivity we did that already go to video my girlfriend it okay are you talking about our communication video or the sexual libido
