today we're going to talk about healthy versus unhealthy anger so how do we know when anger is healthy and when it's sort of like something that we should be experiencing and is okay to experience and how do we know when anger is unhealthy and in either case we're also going to teach you all some techniques to get control of your anger so anger is an incredibly tricky emotion because first of all it causes us to lose control right when we get angry we tend to do things that we will regret later we tend to damage relationships maybe shoot ourselves in the foot in terms of like work or school or things like that the anger gets control of us and then we end up doing things that we regret the other reason that anger is such a problem is because we know that anger causes people to do things that they regret and so then what we do as a society is we tend to demonize anger right when people are publicly pissed off or they express their anger in some way we all Retreat from anger so as a whole we tend to demonize the emotion of anger and so we all sort of think about okay like there's some emotions that are good emotions right like joy and peace and tranquility and love and compassion and curiosity all of these things are good emotions and then they're the bad emotions like anger and sadness and guilt and shame and what we try to do is cultivate lives where we experience a lot of the good emotions and try to minimize the experience of the negative emotions and anger is one that is particularly like difficult to deal with because anger is the one that is oftentimes like harmful to other people and so since we demonize anger it's really hard to figure out like okay like how do I know when it's okay to feel angry when is it okay to feel angry what should I do if I'm feeling angry is this something that will hurt other people or is this like an appropriate healthy emotion that I should be experiencing I want to take a moment to thank our HD coaches I've taught it a lot of different places and worked with a lot of different people and honestly our coaches are some of the best people I've ever worked with he coaches have helped over 10 000 people find purpose Direction and improve their mental health after about 20 weeks of coaching the average client experiences a 58 Improvement in sense of purpose in life a 45 Improvement in feelings of anxiety and even a 35 reduction in feelings of Despair and this isn't just me saying this at this point we've done this for three years run six research studies and even presented our findings at the American Psychiatric association National Conference over 100 000 sessions later I can confidently say this works so if you're interested in checking out he coaching for yourself go to healthygamer.gg coaching to learn more so let's start by looking at healthy anger and let's start by also looking at why we get angry in the first place so we have to understand that anger is like a conserved emotion not just in human beings but across like animals as well right so anger isn't a bug it's a feature our brains are all designed with the capacity for anger and in fact we even look at things like developmental psychology where there are kids who are in their who are two years old and in the U.S we'll talk about the terrible twos which is when kids start to get really like angry this is when children are literally developmentally learning the capacity for anger and so anger is like absolutely a healthy part of our brain and let's understand what it's there for so anger is there to protect our territory so if you think a little bit about like let's look at the Animal Kingdom right when do animals get angry like if one animal has like let's say I'm a tiger and I've like hunted something like I've hunted a deer and then I'm eating my deer and if someone else another animal tries to take that deer away from me as a tiger I'm going to get angry you will see anger in the tiger you'll see sort of this territorial defense and that's what tends to happen in the animal kingdom right anytime the territory of an animal is violated the response is anger so anger is a defensive and protective emotion and if we sort of think a little bit about it like anger does all kinds of stuff to the brain it like lowers our capacity to feel pain right it causes us to engage in conflict and kind of protect ourselves so anger is actually a healthy emotion when it is used to protect our boundaries or territories so when we sort of don't feel that healthy anger and this is like one manifestation of unhealthy anger we sort of become doormats right so in when people like violate my territory I will like let them do that so if someone let's say steals something from me at school and I don't get angry enough if I don't feel that anger if I feel fear instead I will let people take things away from me in places like work or things like that like oftentimes we'll also hear about you know toxicity in the work environment or toxicity from bosses or even situations like sexual harassment or will will sort of hear tons of stuff in our community about like abuse of Home situations abuse of Partners abuse of parents and what those people will oftentimes do is violate our boundaries and then if we don't have a healthy amount of anger we will let people kind of do that there's a whole complicated reason why that is but I just want to point out to you all that when we don't protect our territory that can sort of be an unhealthy form of anger as well and so ideally what we want to do with anger is anger is a signal from our brain our body that hey this is mine and you don't get to take this away from me this can also be kind of problematic because even when we feel healthy anger sometimes we can lose control of it and if we let the anger get the better of us even if it's appropriate we'll end up with sort of a negative outcome right so if if I'm in an abusive situation at home and my parents control my living situation and I get angry with them they will punish me for it okay so the first thing to understand is that anger is healthy and generally speaking when your territory or your boundaries are violated anger is actually a healthy and normal response we still want to be able to control it but this is like an appropriate expression of anger so what is inappropriate anger so inappropriate anger tends to come from thwarted expectations comes from a sense of deservingness or entitlement so if we kind of think about it how does a thwarted expectation activate our territory circuitry in the brain right so think about it for a second like okay what does an expectation have to do with this is territorial protection circuitry so if we really look at expectations what an expectation is is it something that it's a territory that we've claimed that we don't really own that's really what an expectation is right it's this idea that hey this thing is going to happen this thing is mine I deserve this but then I don't get it which means that I end up getting angry so let's just run through a couple of examples so let's say that I like a girl and if I like a girl or a guy whatever right I will invest a lot into the relationship so I'll get this person flowers I'll call them all the time I'll be an emotional support we'll hang out when we go out to dinner I will pay for them and so we sort of think about this like I like this person I'm interested in this person but the more that I invest in the the relationship the more I start to form a territorial wall around this person this is my territory I'm expanding into this this space and this person owes me and then if this person starts dating someone else or doesn't return my texts or things like that I get incredibly angry right other examples of this that I've seen a ton we see this a lot in our career coaching program for example is people who work really hard and then are really upset that they don't get recognized or they they don't get the promotion that they believe that they deserve so this is another example of I'm going to invest a lot of energy and then I expect a return and when I expect a return and I don't get it I end up getting really really pissed off we also see this in our community with people like Gamers right and if you play video games you know what this is like because when I queue up for a particular video game and I have teammates and I'm having a really good game and someone else throws the game I tilt really hard and what is that what is tilt it's a thwarted expectation I did not deserve to lose this game I should have won this game because I was playing really well and this person didn't do what they were supposed to do so I'm gonna get really really really pissed off about it so if we look at what is the nature of unhealthy anger it is thwarted expectation it is when we claim territory right so I've claimed that this is a win I should be winning here this person should love me by now I should get this promotion these are things that I should have and that I am entitled or owed to owed and so when we thwart that expectation when that expectation gets thwarted we lose this territory that we believe we owned and then we get really really pissed off so now the question kind of becomes okay how do we deal with that right so first of all how do we tell if this is really my territory or it's not my territory and in either case if I get upset how should I deal with that so let's understand a little bit about the physiology of anger so when we get angry and we get kind of kind of get this territorial violation right whether it's truly our territory or not which we'll get to our body engages in a whole physiologic response so we activate something called the sympathetic nervous system so this is the part of our our body that basically protects us causes us to engage in in battles so it sort of activates our fight or flight response and in either case even if we're running away from things we still need our body to be very very focused and and have a ton of energy right so when we get angry we activate this part of our nervous system that prepares us for action in the sympathetic nervous system does all kinds of other things cognitively so it causes us to like be like really really one-pointed so it becomes really hard to think about other things it causes us to see things in black and white so we don't really like consider all these other things that may be relevant like let's say I'm playing a video game and even if I played well maybe you know the reason that I'm having a good game is because my team has been making sacrifices for my sake and they haven't been making those sacrifices for my teammate's sake and that's why they're feeding so there's all kinds of things that we don't keep track of when our sympathetic nervous system is active we sort of get this tunnel vision and we see in terms of black and white so one of the key things that we can do to get control of our anger is to disable that sympathetic nervous system activation we actually want to shut down our adrenaline response at least temporarily and one of the simplest ways we can do that is with breathing so if we look at like sort of anger anger is a concerted physiologic response right so we'll we'll sort of release adrenaline adrenaline travels all through our body and activates all kinds of things it changes the way that we think it even causes us to clench our muscles changes our facial expression and very importantly it changes our heart rate and our respiratory Rhythm so our heart rate starts going fast blood pressure goes up in our respiratory rate changes as well right so I'm going to breathe in an angry way that is the the pattern of angry breathing so what can we do so this is what's really interesting if we change our pattern of breathing it will actually deactivate our sympathetic nervous system so if you look at the angry pattern of breathing it's rapid inhalation deep and rapid exhalation right so all we need to do to reduce our anger is to slow down our respiratory rate and one of the simplest things that you can do is just stop breathing for about 10 seconds 15 seconds so just pause your breath if you're feeling angry you can slow down your breathing so you can stretch out one breath to 10 seconds or 12 seconds so six seconds in six seconds out or what what I found is really effective is you can just pause your breathing for 10 seconds so hold your breath and count to ten and then breathe slowly okay so that's one thing you can do it'll literally change your physiology your mind will become a little bit less like kind of tunnel vision you'll be able to like calm down and relax a little bit the other thing that we're going to teach you is oftentimes when we feel angry there's someone else involved and so one of the things that you can do is like literally tell that person that you're feeling angry and take a step back from the situation so you can let's say you're in an argument with someone or you're talking to your parents and they're pissing you off or whatever you can sort of or someone has just told you after you've invested a year of your life and getting them to fall in love with you that they're dating someone else you can even just say to that person hey I'm feeling frustrated and angry right now I need to take a a step back from this conversation or this interaction you literally said that hey I'm feeling frustrated right now I need to take a step back from this conversation okay just use those words and then if you can take a step back if you're in a situation where you can't really control that like you're in the middle of a game right you can maybe mute them or just say hey y'all I'm feeling kind of pissed off like I'm gonna go on mute for a few minutes to try to like Focus you know get my focus back or if you're in a situation at home where that doesn't work like you can't always control that but you can just you can still say it right so you can tell your parents even hey I'm feeling really like frustrated and angry and it's hard for me to listen to you right now can I please take a step away from this conversation and literally what you can do is like leave the room and I've used this actually in clinical settings as well which is like you know if there's a patient who's like yelling at me when I'm trying to help them in the emergency room sometimes first of all it's appropriate for me to be angry with them and this is something that I learned which is really bizarre right so I was training in residency at the time and like there was a patient who was high on cocaine and was very abusive to the staff I went in to try to help them they started cussing me out and using racial slurs and things like that and so I went and I talked to my attending here's a healthy here's an example of healthy use of anger by the way so he goes and he says he walks right in and says hey you can't be doing this this is completely inappropriate you're in a hospital there are nurses here there are doctors here everyone's here to help you the police brought you in and instead of going to jail we are trying to help you so the way you're behaving is completely inappropriate we come in here over and over again to try to help you and you just yell at us so what we're gonna do is step out of the room you can stay here as long as you want to we'll check back in an hour or two hours or three hours and when you're ready to talk to us you better do it in a polite way and if you're not ready to talk to us in a polite way you can you can stay here as long as you want and then he stepped out of the room right and even when I've sort of talked with patients who are very difficult I'll say hey I'm feeling kind of like frustrated so I use that same technique sort of with this with people like that right where they're like yelling at you you can kind of say hey like I'm feeling really frustrated by this conversation I'm here to help you and I feel like I'm not being heard you're not really listening to what I'm saying I can also see that you're feeling frustrated and that people around here don't seem to be listening to what you're saying so I need to take a step away from this because you deserve to be listened to I'll be back in 15 minutes I hope we can continue the conversation that right and then you just step out so acknowledge your feeling of frustration or anger and unless you're in a real heavy power Dynamic kind of situation step out of the conversation and just give yourself the opportunity to calm down so that those are two things that you can do in the moment to get control of your anger the next thing that we have to talk a little bit about is the origins of unhealthy anger so if I have these thwarted expectations if I really want to fix that it's not just about managing the anger in the moment it's about why am I getting into these situations in the first place and when I work with people who are chronically angry pissed off at life they're so mad about you know this political party and they're so bad about the government and they're so mad about capitalism and they're so metal but socialism and they're so bad about men and they're so mad about women they're just mad about everything they're mad at this game at it this game at it this game what's going on with those people who are chronically angry these people have inappropriate expectations so this is what's really tricky is when we get angry oftentimes the mindset that we'll have is I deserve this right and since I didn't get something that I deserve I deserve to be angry and the angry anger is Justified but if you really want to get control over anger it's not about what you deserve it's about what you expect so there are all kinds of people who deserve all kinds of things but that doesn't necessarily make them angry the anger so and this is where like I work with people who are you know 15 years old and have been diagnosed with cancer some of them will get really angry but some of them won't and they'll say I don't deserve this it makes me sad it's unfortunate but I'm not going to get pissed and tilt about it how do I move forward so even in those situations stuff happens all the time to people that they don't deserve but they don't necessarily get angry about it right it's okay to feel some amount of anger but the key thing is if you want to stop being angry like all the time what you really need to focus on is not what you deserve but how did you come to expect this and as we recognize that we will start to get a lot of long-term control over our anger so pay attention to instead of asking yourself what do I deserve ask yourself why did I expect this to happen right and that's where a lot of really really like healing stuff starts to happen that's where you start to get a lot of insight into your own behavior into the behavior of others why did I expect that this person would date me because each time I gave them something I wanted something in return but I never actually let them know right I never actually went out and asked them why did I expect to be promoted there are four people who are up for promotion why did I believe I was entitled to this it's because I worked really hard well the other three people may have worked really hard too right but what why did I think I expected so this is where you really have to Tunnel down into why you expect this in the first place and this is what we try to really help people with especially in things like career coaching is understand that what you expect and what you do are two separate things and there's a beautiful way to kind of think about this which is that what we sort of encourage people to do is focus on the actions but don't expect a particular outcome so if you're working really hard towards something don't do it in the expectation that you're going to get something back so if you have a friend that you're attracted to or if you have a friend if you want to support them you should support them because you think that's the right kind of thing to do not because you want to be owed something in return and similarly at work that's the kind of situation I know this is like kind of weird and may even be counterintuitive but if you want to go the extra mile go the extra mile because you want to learn something or because you want to help the company and if they fail to recognize that that's on them so this is really important that if we really want to get to the origins of that unhealthy anger it comes from our expectations and specifically from our somewhat inappropriate expectations because in this world we can't control what other people do and the whole point of unhealthy anger is we are expecting someone else to do something we are taking territory over someone else's behavior and when they don't behave the way that they're supposed to they're feeding they're not going out with me they decided to promote someone else we get pissed but this is the key thing we can't actually control that right we can't make anyone fall in love with me I don't get to determine every time I queue up who's on my team right I don't get to determine what my who my boss picks to promote all I can control is my actions and so that's what you should really focus on and so try to figure out okay where did I start to expect this why did I expect this how did this expectation build up and as you go through that process what you'll start to discover is that some of the expectations you have in life are a little bit inappropriate and as you start to adjust your expectations now this has nothing to do with what you deserve or how much effort you put in this is what's also a little bit tricky it's like I can I can work really hard and try to do a good job and still not expect that something goes my way this is also something just to give you all an example of like the Nuance of this so as a doctor right I can go to work and I can do a really good job and I can try my hardest but I can't necessarily save a life and that's what's so tricky is that when we work really hard we think oh I deserve to save this life or I did everything that they could why isn't this person living it's just not how it works so medicine teaches you how to walk that tightrope really well which is that in this life all you can do is like control your actions but you can't control how anyone else responds and the really beautiful thing about this is as you start to really focus on what you're doing instead of expecting other people to behave in alignment with what you want it actually frees up a ton of brain space because instead of worrying about how this other person is going to behave and how can I get them to do this and how can I make sure I get promoted instead of worrying about all this that kind of stuff I'm going to focus on my work I'm going to focus on what makes me happy I'm going to focus on how I want to live this life and if these people want to recognize it the value in that that's fine if they don't want to recognize the value in it why do I want to waste my time being upset that someone doesn't recognize my value that doesn't help me at all and so just to summarize anger is a really tricky emotion it's a tricky emotion because first of all we demonize it as a society secondly it oftentimes causes bad things to happen it sort of makes us lose control and potentially even hurt people and the third thing that's like honestly really tricky is everyone's like yeah anger is incredibly healthy like get in touch with your anger but when we get in touch with our anger like sometimes it kind of screws us right like we end up hurting people people don't talk to us anymore and even sort of getting in touch with this healthy anger can sometimes cause us to lose control so even if people are saying okay yeah anger's healthy like you should get in touch with the question is like how and that's the key thing to understand is that if we want to get in touch with our anger if we want to develop a healthy relationship with anger we have to start by understanding what is healthy anger and what is unhealthy anger once we understand those two things that anger is a defensive mechanism designed to help us protect our territory and then we can understand okay when is anger appropriate when is it okay and when is it not okay the last thing to consider is that in either case even if anger is appropriate and someone violates your boundary we still want to be in control of it right and that's where we can use some of these things like breathing techniques or even taking a step away because oftentimes we don't need to act them and Bear right we can literally step away for like five minutes or 10 minutes or 15 minutes or a day or a week or whatever and then come back to the situation and sort of channel that anger in a healthy way where you can say hey I really think what you did was inappropriate and I consider it to be like a violation of my boundaries I really don't think it's fair or appropriate for you to behave this way with me at all you can sort of feel that anger in there but don't let it get control of you and then you can sort of like lay a boundary with them right and so if you want to develop a healthy relationship with anger start by understanding the difference between healthy and unhealthy anger and then furthermore employ some of these techniques to really understand where your expectations come from and even when you're feeling angry how to not let it control you
