we don't really acknowledge this I think consent is incredibly important but most of the advances in relationships don't happen with explicit consent perfect and what do you go by my friend um my post was like I mean an assault for acting weird with my girlfriend um so I I tell the story yes okay um so it was at the party and I was drunk and she was not and at some point we were together in the middle of the room full of people and she kissed me and it was really nice but after the kiss I untied her hair and I said something like make me happy and I used to do something else grab a drink or I don't remember um but I did this because I am really in comfortable to to show love and love affection in public like kissing in public and putting in comfortable for me so to me it was like out of my comfort zone and I I wanted her to do the same so I and I yeah what do you mean by you wanted her to do the same it's the same meaning what uh same as uh getting out of the comfort zone I see so you felt uncomfortable and so you wanted to make her uncomfortable uh somehow I don't know if out of the comfort zone is uncomfortable but yeah probably yeah okay all right so then so you pull uh you removed something from her hair yeah that was tied and okay and then you left the room um yeah but not really far away just like a few meters away okay yeah in my head it was um you know when I'm drawing uh everything seems uh more classy and just better I think it's not alcohol does do that sometimes yeah and so then what happened um she didn't say anything to party on the night but later on she took me she talked about it with her friends and uh it was weird and she didn't really like it and uh it's something that Michael decided to wake up so after a few times after this we woke up uh when you say a few times after this what does that mean what were the times um it's two weeks Okay so and and so you said you you pulled something out of her hair like did it hurt her in some way no just no just like removing like a clip or like a you know a hair tie or something yeah because I think her hair are really beautiful and I like it better untied okay and then and then what did you say um I said it in a in my foreign language so it's not the same yeah but that's fine it looks it's like um he wants a um you want the French [Music] oh it's something like make me happy or please me but so but what what does that or yeah what is the French can you tell us in French [Music] um izo okay and so what does that mean can you I understand what the translation is but what's like the tone of what that means it's like um I um I make her happy with accepting the kiss so I expect her to do something to make me happy as well so is it is it like flirtatious for stage so so I mean is it is it like a nice thing to say or a mean thing to say or a playful thing to say uh maybe a little bit playful depending on who do you mean it and how did you mean it yeah it was a bit um like a little bit challenging I guess okay was it sexual a little bit okay and what's your understanding of why she broke up with you um there was a some event like this that happened and um books a lot of event happened then she didn't felt in love anymore and uh [ __ ] so because I wasn't love anymore I think she stopped to care about me and the ocean the relationship so I think that's it so she wasn't in love anymore she she broke up with me because she fell out of love yeah I think did she talk about this incident when y'all broke up um yeah what did she say um she didn't say much about it just um what uh I said like she told she asked her friends about it and uh she thought it was weird and uh yeah she didn't didn't like it okay and what do you think about it uh I agree that it's weird [Music] of course I wouldn't have done it if I wasn't drunk but it's not so bad I think uh help me understand why you wouldn't have done it if you weren't drunk oh because it's um I am a little bit shy so if I wasn't drawing I I'm not sure I would accept the kiss and uh yeah if it's too ballsy For Me Maybe in front of people doing this I see so accepting the case you wouldn't have done what about the the the the words that you said in the pulling the stuff out of her hair yeah yeah this is what I I was talking about I wouldn't do this either okay so you wouldn't have done any of it no so and maybe do you what do you think about it now that you're I'm presuming that you're not drunk right now now that you're no you're no longer drunk what do you think about what you did um yeah just like I said I think it's it's stupid like it's it's fully real I mean it's not something I will do what's weird about it um all right I I I don't know it's just uncommon and come on and uh not something she would expect me to do okay um this so I I and how long were you all dating uh six months okay and um have you all talked about her hair before no uh uh not not really really but I think she she knew that I liked her hair but then I nothing nothing okay so I and like I'm just not sure like what's normal in a relationship for a kind of what stage you were at so sometimes like it's okay for someone to like mess with or play with your hair right so like for example I'm married and sometimes my wife messes with my hair and that's like okay in our relationship I don't always like it but it's something that we're okay with do you know if like I mean is that something that y'all had done in terms of like I think yeah I think it's it would be okay if it wasn't in public because we were kind of in the middle of the room and yeah it wasn't just uh playful like it was after a kiss and yeah I think this is why it's weird okay but uh otherwise it will be only okay to to do this okay so um and what do you think do you think that you were out of line a little bit yeah in what way do you think you were out of line because she didn't want her hair to be untied did you know that she didn't um she didn't she didn't tell me but I could um somehow I think I knew it I mean no I didn't knew she didn't want to untie but I mean if they were tied must be a reason okay and do you think that um and and how drunk were you um puts you well in like to me it's close to my limits the close to your limit of being drunk so you're definitely drunk but if you were more drunk you would have been like sick kind of thing maybe yeah yeah I was really really drunk okay so you know I think so twitch chat voted 41 thinks that everyone here is the [ __ ] 33 think that you're the [ __ ] 25 don't think you're the [ __ ] what do you think I didn't understand how many things uh so the most people think that both you and your girlfriend are at fault so everyone sucks okay 40 of people think that everyone made mistakes thirty percent of people think that you're the [ __ ] twenty percent of people don't think you're the [ __ ] okay what do you think 33 and 25. what do you think most people most people think we both are [ __ ] yes that's the number one and and this is where so here here's my take okay so the first thing that we have to acknowledge is that if you were drunk there is a decent chance that your memory of the situation is off in some way yeah so the first thing that I'm gonna kind of say is that like we've got to be careful here because you may have remembered things in a particular way it could have been worse it could have been better like who knows so I think if you're getting pretty drunk and you're like doing things that you all don't normally do I mean that's what happens when people get drunk but I don't think and it kind of bothers me a little bit that you were like I wouldn't have done this if I wasn't drunk you know so that kind of makes me wonder a little bit but then as we tunnel down into that it seems like the reason that you wouldn't have done it isn't that you think it's wrong it's that you're shy right yeah so yeah so yeah I'm not I'm not sure but I wouldn't have done it yeah so I think the only thing that I think is really assholish about this for you is that she made you uncomfortable and then you did something to make her uncomfortable yeah so like that I think is [ __ ] so is it Justified Maybe right so if I if I call someone a nasty thing are they justified in calling me a nasty thing maybe but I mean it sounds to me like you felt uncomfortable that she did something that you didn't really consent to or feel comfortable with and so your response to that is I'm gonna do something that she doesn't like or doesn't make her comfortable and that doesn't sound right to me I think the other thing in terms of the mistake here is not necessarily in the behavior but in the way that the aftermath of the occurrence so the other kind of question here is did she know that public displays of affection make you uncomfortable no yeah that's it was a that's what I was gonna say it's she didn't actually don't know she didn't know no so so I mean so this is where I think that like you know I think the real tragedy here is that you all didn't like talk about this and when people say like communication is the foundation of a relationship I think this is oftentimes people don't know what that means what that means is that if your partner does something that makes you uncomfortable the right way to handle it is not to make them feel uncomfortable but to talk about it yeah but I think maybe there is another reason for me to act like this and what is that maybe I I thought that it was some kind of teasing to kiss me in public like this and uh maybe it was just my answer to to the teasing sure it it's that that's the thing right so sometimes in relationships I don't think you're wrong there that like sometimes in relationships part of the natural progression of the relationship is to kind of like up the ante and and enter into like uncomfortable spaces the key thing though I think is that usually that needs to be done with like some amount of being on the same team as opposed to like I did this to you so you're going to do it to me or vice versa does that make sense yeah yeah I mean this doesn't sound to me like a horrible violation of consent and maybe I'm wrong there but like you know if you're dating someone for six months I think like playing with their hair which is one way that you could perceive this I think is like something that is probably okay I mean presuming that nothing you know presuming they haven't made it clear one way or the other but the the honest truth about relationships and I think this is something that we kind of like you know we don't really acknowledge this I think consent is incredibly important but most of the advances in relationships don't happen with explicit consent so simple things like for example do you mind if I eat a french fry off of your plate like sometimes a lot of stuff happens in the comfort of relationships that happens kind of like subconsciously and like it's not like we ask for permission for every single thing is it okay if I kiss you like that's a good thing to ask consent for is it okay if I kiss you for one second two seconds three seconds do you have to ask for consent every time you kiss like generally speaking in relationships we don't do that like there's a certain amount of like navigating things forward and that can absolutely get people into trouble don't get me wrong I do think we should probably be having more conversations around consent not less but I think the real mistake here the only two things that I really thought that that you know one thing is that if she I mean if she didn't know you you didn't appreciate it being kissed in public and y'all have been dating for six months then you know I think if y'all kiss in private at some point that starts to become public unless you lay a boundary for her so had you laid some kind of boundary no so so then then I think the only real [ __ ] thing that I think you kind of did here is that she made you feel uncomfortable and based on what you're kind of sharing with us there was a part of you that was like she made me feel this way so I'm gonna make her feel this way whereas I can sort of get that you know if there's a public display of affection you can kind of be flirtatious I I don't know if you are familiar with that word in English yeah yeah it's yeah and so this sounds to me like within the normal bounds of flirtation like if your partner kisses you in public touching her hair in some way and making a suggestive comment especially depending on the tone and stuff like that maybe completely acceptable I'm not hearing something that was degrading or overtly sexual which I but I don't understand the translation or the connotation or things like that so but I think really what I'm here the only real thing because I I think what you tried to do in that moment is become a Chad for a second right yeah probably this is you in public and you're like Chad mode baby but it sounds like you're not really practiced at that so it may have come off a little bit cringy and creepy and you know that's unfortunately part of like you know even Chad stumble from time to time on the road to chadhood but along the way it's perfectly reasonable that as you're stumbling you may be an [ __ ] somewhere in there no what do you think um I think maybe my understanding about why I did this might be wrong like I I justify myself with saying that um I did I did this to make her own comfortable but I don't know like I'm not sure because uh I was drawing and I don't really know why I did this yeah so I mean I but like that that's kind of the tricky thing so I think the other mistake here is getting really drunk yeah right which like at the end of the day you're still responsible for your behavior when you're drunk but I'm I'm also not hearing that you're like your girlfriend's friends thought it was weird but I'm not even hearing that she really found it to be like violating or anything like that um a little bit I think when you say you think what do you base that on um when she told me about it so what did you think um I don't remember everything but because she told the her friends about it I think it was something big for her okay I mean yeah so you know I I think it's kind of an edge case but I definitely think there are things here that you could or should have done differently like just to be on the safe side but I mean we're not you know we're talking about removing some stuff out of someone's hair now this is like what would cross over into [ __ ] territory if she likes her hair a particular way and you like it a different way and then you consistently turn her hair into something that you find enjoyable or like pleasing to look at as opposed to what her preference is but that I'm also not hearing because it's not like you guys had conversations about hairstyles and stuff it sounds like you just tried something and it sort of didn't work out yes that's not something I wouldn't do so and furthermore the drunkenness it's not like I wouldn't do it because I'm a moral person and when I become drunk I'm immoral it sounds like really the drunkenness removes the shyness which you know is so I I mean I think it's kind of an edge case but the real tragedies here I think is that you didn't really talk about it and also that you know there wasn't any kind of serious conversation afterward which there probably should have been and then probably like getting super drunk like doesn't help yes that's I came to the same conclusion yeah so you know my my sense is you were probably a little bit of the [ __ ] but just a little bit how does that sound to you yeah I think yeah I agree yeah yeah I think I think the same cool yeah thank you you're very welcome good luck to you my friend good luck to you dude
