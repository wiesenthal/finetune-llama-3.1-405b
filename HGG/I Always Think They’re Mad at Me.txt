somewhere along the way your mind has learned right because that's what our mind does that silence or a lack of overt expression of anger means that someone is angry with you and they're just not saying it as you tolerate an emotion it naturally extinguishes over time the problem with emotions is when we give in to them they grow but when we just like sort of like respond neutrally to an emotion it actually like extinguishes over time i don't like the idea of somebody going about their relationship kind of constantly in fear of their partner getting mad at them so i feel like having conversations around like how to healthily express that you're not happy about something the other one is doing is a good idea hello hello hi um so i'll keep on assuming that my partner is upset with me whenever he he's like sai or if he's silent for a long time um and i seem to be afraid of him getting mad at me so my question is how can i stop fearing that i didn't i didn't hear the very first part of what you were saying can you can you say that one more time i'm a bit quiet but i'll try to okay um i keep on assuming my partner is upset with me whenever he is say be silent for a long time they seem to be afraid of him getting mad at me how can i stop fearing that does your partner get mad at you well no i just always kind of assume that he's going to get mad at me whenever he shows like it's like this like sign of being upset with something i assume it's like about me okay thanks for clarifying do other people get mad at you um not really so how do you so this is this is an interesting way you want to take a stab at this or no i just love her so this is it's kind of interesting because let me just think about so a lot of times people will ask questions like how do i stop being afraid that my partner is mad at me so what a lot of people are looking for is a solution that removes the emotion from the equation right like i want to stop feeling this way whereas i think the real answer is not to stop feeling that way because something is going on in your mind there's some somewhere along the way your mind has learned right because that's what our mind does that silence or a lack of overt expression of anger means that someone is angry with you and they're just not saying it and the problem with that is that if you continue to kind of be in your own head it can become a self-fulfilling prophecy like if i say to kruthi like why are you mad at me yeah by the tenth time i'm gonna be like right so if she's like i'm not mad at you no no no no i i know you're mad at me like why are you mad at me like what did i do why won't you tell me right and then she yells i'm not mad so it sort of becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy so your mind sort of learns like oh like they really were see i knew it i knew it all along they were actually mad at me so you've got to be a little bit careful there so what i would actually recommend doing is sharing with your partner what you're feeling in that moment and so this isn't where and then what your partner is likely to do is to try to reassure you i'm not mad at you and then you can share with them again that you know when you say that to me for some reason my mind isn't able to digest it and then oddly enough for you and your partner for your partner not to reassure you like we don't want to have your partner try to fix you being afraid that they're mad with you but that the two of you can just sort of sit with your fear and like just tolerate it because the problem is going to be that as you as you tolerate an emotion it naturally extinguishes over time the problem with emotions is when we give in to them they grow but when we just like sort of like respond neutrally to an emotion it actually like extinguishes over time so one way to kind of think about like that's the principle behind exposure therapy which is that we we literally expose patients to what they're afraid of and then we just let the fear come up and then we just don't do anything with it and then the fear like kind of naturally extinguishes so what i would recommend is share with your partner what's going on in your head but don't try to fall into the trap of reassurance before you do that can i ask you a few questions yes how how long have you been together um a little bit more than a year more than a year go ahead logan a long distance so we have met like maybe three times are you still long distance yes we're probably like uh not being long distance but for now we're long distance but the few times we have met i noticed that it's you know it's not only over online video calls that i feel that whenever he makes uh enough angry look or something that i fear that he's mad at me it's also the same in real life so i notice it's not about like the uh online things can be you know confusing it's the same in real life too and okay so long-distance relationship did you meet in person or you met online in person ah okay um and how long did you know each other in person uh about the whole view with what in person okay and were the kind of size and looks um at that did that happen when you were first together i'm trying to understand if this is like a new thing or if this has always been there no when we first went together i didn't notice that it was like a bit later that it started coming when we get to know each other more and stuff got it another question that i have is is it okay for your partner to be mad at you i guess not i guess i'm like really sensitive to like being mad at me like a few times you have been mad at me it has been really like bad for me yeah so i think more long term so i think there's like a short term like communication is key here and what is communication because everyone's like communication is really important but no one ever tells you like what does that actually mean so i would share that you know i for some reason my mind is telling me that you're upset with me right now and it's making me uncomfortable have have when he was is it mad at you or upset with you like are these situations where he feels like you've wronged him in some way and has been like angry with you or are these like more just general yeah no the first one okay so like set with me okay and then it does not happen a lot but you know it happens sometimes very rarely okay and then when you when you guys make up do you talk about how hey that was really hard for me when you got that angry with me um yeah you talk about it and what what he says it's it's usually like yeah i know i probably shouldn't have like gotten that mad at you like i probably shouldn't have started with the insults you know that was like a step before i should have kept it like moral okay objective you know okay but like yeah i feel like i understand a little bit more um and i definitely agree with what alex said but i do think in addition to this you can have some boundaries over what you are willing and not willing to like engage with so you can say like hey i really can't handle it when you get angry with me like this and that and if you are feeling this way i need some space i need some time i need you to because you're a long distance also that makes it hard so you can be like can you write this down for me because it's hard for me to be in a situation where um i think you're going to explode at me or something i don't know the dynamic exactly but i i think i don't i don't like the idea of somebody going about their relationship kind of constantly in fear of their partner getting mad at them so i feel like having conversations around like how to healthily express that you're not happy about something the other one is doing is a good idea like i think it's a good idea to have conversations around like you know i'm getting a little anxious that you're getting upset with me because the last time we went through this this was really hard for me so if you are upset with me can you please like fill in the blank can you please let me know before it gets bad can you please write it down for me so i can know what's going on with you can you please um just be straightforward that hey i'm doing something that upsets you like whatever that irrelevant situation is but i i think i'm nervous that you would um kind of have that constant fear because long-distance relationships are hard so sometimes i think like if that is what is happening then i feel like a conversation about how to communicate discontent with each other is a good idea there's a possibility um like i know we were long distance for years and sometimes like sometimes i feel like olive got the worst of me because that was the time where i was like i've had such a shitty day and here's all the bad stuff that's happening and he was the person that i would kind of like unload on and i think there's a way like if that could have easily been interpreted as like god this girl does not want to be with me like she's angry with me because she like i'm the i'm constantly hearing the complaints so i i guess if i had to like branch this out right like he either is mad at you or he's not if he's not mad at you what is actually going on if he is mad at you have some conversations around boundaries and what's going on in like healthy expressions of anger and i also really like the idea of like once you make up like what did we learn uh i don't know like when you make up do you feel like oh this i've learned that he doesn't like this or i've learned that when i do this this is like something that he can't deal with yeah i guess you do like you you learn um how the person like felt when you did something you cannot understand them better right do you feel like you could do what ruthie is asking you to do um communicating when i start to feel like he's mad at me i'm sorry what like communicating when i feel like he's mad do you think you could do that do you think you could set boundaries on him about how insulting you is not okay i feel like he won't listen when he's angry what about when he's not angry he's not angry yes okay so i think that's useful i think the other thing to just remember or maybe i can ask you is what kind of emotions should you expect your partner to feel over the course of your relationship what do you mean by over the course of so like let's say you date this person for another year which emotions do you think your partner will feel over the course of that year um all kinds of emotions like yeah right exactly so like in a weird way i know it's kind of weird but like he's gonna get angry and that's okay it's like part of the price you pay for being in a relationship right because you're not the perfect partner and he isn't the perfect partner but angry with her sure for but it sounds like she's she doesn't see it coming like it's just kind of out of well i mean i think there's a couple things so you can absolutely do all the communication stuff but you know what i'm really noticing is that there's a part of you that feels like anger in a relationship is unacceptable and should be avoided at all costs is that fair yeah so i think that i think is you're setting an unrealistic expectation on yourself because it is a part of relationships does that make sense it may be terrifying what do you think about that um yeah i think that you know that as you're saying that he's gonna feel all kinds of emotions because he's human too and uh i can't expect him to not ever get angry because then he would be like a robot you know um i have to accept that he's going to be angry sometimes and be angry with me sometimes even but so i'm just a bit confused how i can like assume somebody is mad to me is because they like sigh and then even though i ask him like all the time like are you mad at me when he does that and he says no he's still like the next time he sigh i still are like are you mad at me like even though i constantly get told psy doesn't equal that somebody's mad at you yeah so i think there's there's that's where the communication piece comes in so i think there's like two things here just to kind of summarize one is the communication piece that when you're feeling like this person is angry with you sometimes it sounds like that perception is actually incorrect the challenge is that if we put ourselves in his shoes how is he if you if he sighs which humans do and you interpret that as anger like how can he kind of fix that right because it's kind of hard because it's kind of like the example i shared with ruthie where it's like if i'm like hey are you mad at me and she says no and i'm like oh she's just saying that that's what my mind will tell me right she's not really telling me what's going on so you're sort of setting up a situation in which like there's only one outcome because you're not able to be reassured so communication there is really important but i think the other thing that is more long-term is just your relationship with being in a unable to tolerate his anger so if he's insulting you and stuff that's not acceptable so you should set boundaries around that maybe not while he's angry but after the fact you can say hey you know like that's really not okay so completely agree with that but just for you to understand that first of all he's gonna get upset in relationships he may get upset with you and this is the wild thing just because he's upset with you doesn't mean that you did something wrong right because like sometimes we get mad at people in fact frequently we get mad at people especially those closest to us when we are upset with something else in our life right right so if i'm having problems at work and i can't yell at my boss and i'm carrying that anger around with me what am i going to do when i get home i'm going to lash out at my family members right so that's where like he may even get angry with you but somewhere along the way you've got to do some like good deep work and understand that just because he's mad at you doesn't actually mean that you're doing anything wrong because that's just the way that humans are he may not be able to separate his anger or frustration with other things from and make you know he may let it out on you in some way which isn't good on his part i'm not saying that that's okay but it's we're human and for you to sort of understand that like he may sometimes get mad at you because that's what happens in relationships sometimes it's unfortunate but we offer the worst parts of ourselves to the people that we care about the most and the people that we're closest to thoughts about that i think it sounds so good um but i remember you you also said something that caught my interest about um like not trying to avoid um the fear like not trying to fix the fear but like sitting with the fear it cannot maybe the same thing as communicating i don't know but yes so i'll give you i'll give you an example okay so i was once working with someone who had been in a prior relationship where their partner was unfaithful with them so this person started to dis like they had a lot of distrust because they had been betrayed and so later a couple years later they found a new relationship ended up getting pregnant and what they sort of noticed is as they got more pregnant and as they started to feel insecure about their body they started to become really really paranoid that their partner would start being unfaithful with them completely different person and the person had not really given them any reason to you know think that this person is going to be unfaithful you following me so far no and so then what would happen is the the person would uh so the the person i was working with the pregnant woman would be afraid be paranoid okay like my partner's cheating on me so what she would do is when he would take a shower at night she would start going through his phone and just to make sure that he wasn't doing anything bad right so then she did it once and she was like okay so it looks like i have nothing to worry about and then after she checked his phone once do you think the fear went away no absolutely not right so then she was like okay i have nothing to worry about went away for a couple of days and then it started creeping back in the more her belly grew bigger the less attractive she felt the more the paranoia got worse and then she started checking his phone more frequently and then it got to the point where she checked his phone every night when he went to take a shower and after she did that for a week do you think she stopped no of course not right so the more that she gave into the fear the like the big the bigger it became and so eventually he caught her right and then like they went they both wound up in my office and so we sort of had a conversation about it and then what we sort of came to the conclusion of because he felt like it was a betrayal of trust he felt like it was very very unfair for her to think those thoughts about him because he had been nothing but faithful and he was like i've never done anything that you know i've nev like it's not fair what you're doing like i understand that you're afraid but it's not fair to me that you're violating my privacy and so then what we kind of came to the conclusion and the person was like i actually don't mind that you're looking through my phone like i have nothing to hide but like the fact that you're kind of doing it behind my back and like i feel kind of violated and so then what we sort of came to the conclusion of is when she's feeling that way she should communicate that to him and then something cool started to happen so he she tells him hey like i'm feeling kind of paranoid i'm feeling like you know you're gonna find someone who's prettier than me and someone who's not pregnant and and things like that and and so he'd be like you know that's not the case do you want to look through my phone and then she'd he'd offer it right and then she'd say like no no no it's okay and then like over time what happened is like every time she sort of felt that way he was like you can look through my phone if you want to would that make you feel better and she would say no and then over time she's like you know i'm kind of feeling like i want to look through your phone and then they just like sit together they talk about it for a few minutes and then they'd be fine so sort of like acknowledging the fear noticing the fear but not giving into it kind of together seem to actually diminish it because then she's not giving into it so the thoughts and emotions in our mind that we give into are the ones that grow does that make sense in terms of how to sit with something yes it makes very much sense right and someone in chat is saying second phone confirmed and believe me that was a part of the conversation as well right and then eventually what you realize is there's like if someone if your partner is paranoid there's nothing you can do there's some stuff you can do within reason but there's no amount of objective truth that you can give to the paranoid mind to convince it does that make sense like people can be so damn paranoid that second phones third phones fourth phones fifth phones right like the like your mind can get take control of you and so that's where i'm i'm sort of suggesting that you talk to your partner about how you're feeling and then you'll learn how to sit with it um as opposed to you know kind of giving into it or stopping feeling that way that's mine okay does that answer does that help yes it helps very much thank you thank you for calling in and good luck good luck i hope you all are able to be long just i mean not be long distance anymore because that sucks it does thank you for having me bye you
