every once in a while this is where things get good every once in a while someone will say yes and your dad will be like yeah i went through a very similar thing started shooting myself up with testosterone and that's how i learned how to be a man i swear to god every once in a while you have that and then it's an eye-opening moment right and it's like wait a minute maybe my dad has gone through something similar right maybe this is why he's terrified because he's spent his entire life trying to convince himself that he's cisgender i swear to god this happens every once in a while it happens hey everyone i've been watching healthy gamer for a while and has helped me out but this is the first time i've had the courage to write anything strong work right i recently came out as trans to my family and they have not taken the news well at all i feel bad because even though it's something that i have wanted to do because it will make me happy it ends up hurting a lot of people in the process my friends and extended family have been very supportive of me but my immediate family is basically disappointed with me they try to convince me about how i should try to date girls work out more and take testosterone so that it would fix me i know that deep down it wouldn't change my feelings but it's hard to communicate that to them so i end up lying how could i date someone if i can't even look in the mirror and see myself all my life i've had feelings of powerlessness and i've been trying to meet the impossible standards of my parents i understand that it is a lot for them to process and i would be very scared if i was in their shoes but their lack of compassion and understanding is very disheartening anyways if anyone has advice or thoughts and is going through a similar experience i would love to hear about it so this unfortunately is an increasingly common experience that is precisely why it's very very important to talk about so we're going to talk about now is first of all if you're trans how can you talk to your family there's going to be a lot of individual variation there depending on you know your family and and what the situation is but in general i think that one of the things that we've missed out on is sort of a skill set to talk to our parents or other people about things that they're not really comfortable with so it doesn't have to be trans it can be stepping away from the religion of your parents it can be stepping into a different religion it can be wanting to become a professional gamer or a streamer as a career it can be getting a tattoo it can be moving out of the house it can be majoring in something that is not if you're indian medicine pre-law engineering finance or cs right like there there are all kinds of things that our family will react poorly to and then we sort of feel like you know there's a lack of compassion and understanding it starts to feel very disheartening and then what we end up doing is we end up lying and why do we do that it's to preserve some semblance of a relationship right because like you can't fix this problem so like i'm gonna just sweep it under the rug because you care about your family presumably your family cares about you this doesn't seem like when you try to talk about it things don't seem to be moving in the right direction and so as a result like what's the point of having a conversation that's just gonna get like move things in the wrong direction so you start avoiding you start lying you start feeling internally dis like you know disconnected from them you start putting on a mask and you kind of wind up in the situation where your family disapproves of your choices whether it's sexuality gender identity religion career choice what you wear i one time had a patient whose parent felt personally offended by their grooming habits they're like don't you realize how you make me look bad when you don't shave don't you realize how bad it makes me look right it's like i didn't realize that my personal grooming had to be held to the standard of your social reputation i i didn't connect those two dots right so the question then becomes okay like how do we talk to people like this right so the first thing is especially if you're trans you you know i think you've got to be careful for a number of reasons the first is that remember that gender identity and even sexuality tend to like take time to form so i've worked with some trans people who knew from a very very young age that their gender identity was not like their biological identity and they were like it was set in stone a long time ago they were just born into the wrong body i met with other i've worked with other people who felt like they were non-binary or something in the middle and then like later on sort of like solidified actually their biological gender right so there's the teenage years in adolescence and young adulthood are like a big part of discovering who we are and so one of the things that i think actually happens way too often is that we try to jump to labels to capture our experience so for example like just because someone you know is not starts to have feelings for starts to be sexually attracted to the same gender let's say at the age of 14 or 15 they may be terrified that they're actually homosexual jump to the conclusion that they're homosexual they assign themselves a label because it helps them organize their life some and then later on they may discover actually that they're bisexual or pansexual so this is something that i think is actually kind of a problem is that i think we jump to labels too quickly and now we have so many labels right so i'm like demiflex i'm non-binary pansexual bisexual so just remember that discovering who you are is a process it's not something that you have to like figure out by the age or 15 and a half and then you stamp yourself with a label and that's what it is for the rest of your life that's been my predominant experience so give yourself time you know don't lock your yourself in if you know what you are if you're one of the people who knows from the very young age that's totally fine then it doesn't apply to you both i've seen both both versions okay so then the question kind of becomes how do i talk to my family so this is where you know is this person kind of pointed out it's a lot to absorb right so this is also where if you think about issues of gender identity and you think about the time scale that the individual has to come to terms with their gender identity is usually a lot greater than what their family has right so like if i've been struggling with my gender identity since the age of three and then on my 19th birthday i come out to my parents as transgender i've had 16 years to like figure that out right and then like six months later my parents haven't nearly had that much time i mean they haven't had like they've had six months and you've had 16 years so it is a lot for people to process they have certain conceptions of you right they have certain maybe hopes or dreams or things like that so parents oftentimes have to go through when i'm trying to help parents develop healthy relationships with their transgender children will actually go through a mourning process and i i've done this also with parents who have special needs kids so i'm not trying to say that trans and special needs is the same my point is that both of these kinds of situations are a parent will develop a conception or even non-special needs kids you know just kids who decide not to become doctors with indian parents so there's a mourning process that parents need to go through where they had all these ideas of like for example it seems like you know you're biologically you're born as a man and you know you're a transgender woman so your you know your dad or mom may like your mom have had may have had all these dreams and and kind of like hopes about what she was going to do with her daughter-in-law and she was going to have these daughter-in-law spa weekends and all this kind of stuff right so your parents have like built up all these conceptions which it takes time to like let go and mourn so i think it's healthy for parents to like mourn that kind of stuff and then you as their child should try to be as patient as you can so that's the first thing is to recognize that the timeline that you've had to deal with this change and the timeline that your parents have had to deal with this change is probably different or your immediate family the next thing to consider is that often times when you're trying to get your parents to understand that's the experience that i've had with a lot of trans people is that they're struggling to get their parents their family to understand right like they they their lack of compassion and understanding is very disheartening which i completely get so this is where it's it's foreign to them so it's going to be hard for them to understand so i know this sounds kind of weird but often times what i think is almost like a mistake or if it's not a mistake it's just you need to think a little bit about whether this is the primary thing you should be doing at this time is instead of trying to explain to them what your experience is try to understand their experience this is the second thing that you can do so i would start with questions like this so when i work with families these are the kinds of questions i'll ask as a therapist in the room which kind of brings people together right which is that so now that you're you've discovered that you know this person who you thought of as a son is actually like your daughter what is that like for you what does it mean for you that if i'm a woman instead of a man what is the significance of that and you can even dig into some of the stuff that's actually really hurtful right so this is like this is the hardest thing is that sometimes family members will try to like slot you into their conception so once i have a conception of what your life should be like and this has nothing to i mean this goes way beyond you know being trans or special needs or whatever so if i'm a parent and i have a conception i am a baseball coach and i want my son to be a star baseball player can be you know trans expectations you can have sports expectations you can have career expectations right and to be fair not all of these have the same level of difficulty in terms of adjustment so i think coming to terms with the fact that your child is of a different gender requires a lot i would hope a larger shift than someone who doesn't want to be a professional athlete if that's bad if that's the scale of change that a professional change is but and so they have this like conception of what they want you to be and you don't want to be that thing right so they they grew like when you were two years old you got your first catchers mitt and they threw the ball around with you every single day and then you're like actually i don't like baseball i like fortnight and then what your parents do is they try to slot you back in there right so your parents may say things like you know pretty unaccepting things like try to date girls work out more take testosterone so it'll fix you it'll be like you know they're like get back into the box we put this box for you and you need to inject yourself with a hormone and then get back into the box right because if you have to inject yourself with hormones that's really you know that's that's how you know what's natural and what is suiting suited to you so this can happen a lot where parents like just don't understand you and so they try to like they're trying to make sense of it they're trying to like make it work in their head so they'll try to push you into a particular thing and that's where i would you know once again ask them questions so i would start with like questions like you know if i dated girls what do you think that would change right how would that affect me how would that affect you what effect do you think dating girls would have if i started working out more like what do you think would happen just ask them open-ended questions in a non-judgmental way and oftentimes i find this is the best way to like expose their ignorance right so when they're unable to provide answers to these questions and they may provide answers like yeah like once you work out more like it'll just become clear and then like i would dig in a little bit help me understand that so you seem really confident that what will become clear you know like and then let's say your dad does work out doesn't work out do you feel like when you work out like do you feel like that's when you feel like a man like do you feel like a man at other times too like what is your understanding like how do you know you're a man so i would just start to ask lots of questions right so try to understand their viewpoint and as you ask questions and as you sort of like try to understand their viewpoint that's going to do a couple of really important things the first is that it'll establish a dialogue of curiosity and understanding instead of trying to convince people or force people or whatever so you're going to be modeling for them that hey like i'm here to listen i'm here to try to understand and it opens the door for them to reciprocate huge this is why people go to licensed therapists because like therapists establish a foundation of like curiosity and openness and understanding second thing it'll do is it'll start to help you understand how to talk to them because once you understand their their understanding of how the world works that like transgender issues can just be fixed with testosterone like gender identity issues can be fixed and then so you know you can be a little bit inquisitive about that be like did you need to take testosterone to understand that you were a man and then like every once in a while this is where things get good every once in a while someone will say yes and your dad will be like yeah i went through a very similar thing started shooting myself up with testosterone and that's how i learned how to be a man i swear to god every once in a while you have that and then it's an eye-opening moment right and it's like wait a minute maybe my dad has gone through something similar right maybe this is why he's terrified because he's spent his entire life trying to convince himself that he's cisgender i swear to god this happens every once in a while it happens but it brings people together right and so like it works for your dad now he doesn't take the testosterone shots he feels like secure in his masculinity like whatever that you'll be amazed like so i've seen this all the time with like especially things like drug abuse and i've seen this with patients who have to get abortions or thinking about getting abortions and stuff like that they had no idea right like this i don't want to go into too much detail for patient privacy so i'll be a little bit chimerical but there was one kid i was working with who had a parent who was very controlling and then like parent really didn't a kid didn't really know much about like parent in their late teens early 20s so a parent grew up in the 60s okay so like back in the kind of good old days of the 60s and they showed their kid kid was going through a drug problem showed their kid a picture of them like at woodstock or something like that i don't remember the exact festival and like prompted such an awesome conversation where like the reason the parent was like so restrictive against drugs is because drugs really screwed up their life and they were totally into it and like messed things up and all kinds of stuff so like it's facilitated some surprising sharing so what you want to do is ask questions right ask questions try to get them to understand like explain to me like what do you think is going to happen if i do this this or this right so if you've tried dating girls for example you can even ask them what's your understanding of like who i've dated and like what that experience was like right and like so you can try to try to understand their perspective and hopefully what will happen is usually what happens in my experience if you sort of approach things non-judgmentally and really try to understand them what you'll discover is that there's not a whole lot of foundation to their beliefs or they have some kind of personal investment and you can even acknowledge that so like for example if you're a male to female if you're going through a male to female transition and your mom really wanted to have a daughter-in-law right because she's got two sons and so she was really looking forward to having a son i mean a daughter-in-law because she wanted to have daughter-in-law's spa trips that's where you can like talk to her about that and it's like what's it like for you for you to not have that like what do you think about like me and you going on a spot trip right because like yeah instead of having two sons now you have a son now you have a daughter like you know i'd like to do that with you what it like you know those kinds of things are the kinds of moments and discussions and connections which i think that in discussions of like gender identity like we just lose sight of and so try to just really understand their perspective and then if you're lucky if you're blessed if you're lucky if you set the right kind of foundation and you try to genuinely understand their perspective even acknowledge their perspective you can watch the communication workshop by the way that's a video on our youtube channel that is hard to understand but it's really good if you can understand it then hopefully they'll start to try to understand you and then you can start explaining but generally speaking people i it's been my experience that like you know someone has to be in the right frame of mind they have to have an open mind to be able to really hear your words and what i find too often in in conversations between parents and kids is that the parents will have a conception kid doesn't agree with that conception and the parent is not really in a frame of mind to listen to what the kid has to say so it's like it's a flight that you know never gets off the ground basically because they're and then then it leads to increasing frustration resentment you're not listening you're not listening you're not understanding you're not understanding and then you push and you push and then no one feels understood and then like messes up the communication and then we go to things like lying and avoidance and let's just pretend and like all this kind of other band-aid sort of solutions that don't actually fix the problem and there are a couple of questions you can do to facilitate that you know is some of those are really simple questions they're like do you want to understand what my experience is and that's when the parent says yes and that's when you can ask okay what's your understanding so far and then they'll say well i think you're just confused okay what have i said if i said that i feel confused at all like well no but you're just confused okay so now you can see why i have difficulty with this conversation because i'm saying something and i understand that you think i'm confused but do you see how from my perspective it doesn't seem like you're really listening at all all you're doing is sharing your opinion does that make sense to you right because you're not really acknowledging what i'm saying and you don't have to get into whether you're trans are not trans you can sort of focus on the communication issue of the words that i'm speaking are not being received it's like i'm transmitting this signal but the signal is like not getting received and so what should we do about that you can even ask your parents what should we do about that well you should just take a testosterone shot and that'll fix the problem it's like yeah i don't think i'm gonna do that right so this is it's a problem for me because i'm i'm feeling like communication is really important for us and that it's not really happening i'm not sure what else i can do so if you're in this situation where you know you're coming out as trans or anything else that breaks away from your parents conception to summarize a couple of things to keep in mind the first is that you probably have had more time to come to terms with this than they have and sometimes the amount of time that you've had is like orders of magnitude higher right we're talking years versus weeks or months decade versus three months so try to be as patient as you can second thing is remember that they may have to go through some amount of mourning or adjustment and that talking to them about what that experience is like can be like very helpful so and then what we want to do is sort of create this environment this sort of foundation of like curiosity and understanding so instead of trying to get them to understand you what you need to do is understand that what does this mean for you if i'm trans what do you think this means for my life are you worried about me not worried about me do you think i'm going to be happy do you think i'm not going to be happy do you think i'm confused like help me understand that like where do you get the idea that i'm confused oh i see because i don't understand things the way that you understand them you're coming to the conclusion that i'm confused what's your understanding of how long i've been thinking about this and what this journey has been like for me so you want to start with curiosity you know try to understand their perspective and hopefully what they'll do you'll model that behavior and then they'll start to be open-minded towards you they may have to do some mourning then if you're lucky at some point they'll want to understand your experience and they'll start to ask you questions and as they ask you questions they're actually going to be open-minded enough to listen to your answers the challenge is that for a lot of people who are trying to get their parents to adjust to some change in in my life if i'm trying to get my parents to adjust i'm impatient right i want them to adjust now last thing that i'll say is that sometimes your parents are right right not necessarily saying for gender identity but like sometimes your parents are right so i've seen this especially when it comes into like premature relationships especially things like marriage where your parents are like you're like this is my partner i've known them for six weeks and we're in love and we're gonna get married i need you to accept them unconditionally your parents are like well they're kind of an [ __ ] no support me unconditionally this is my choice i choose my choice either you need to accept them or we're done it's like 18 months later you get divorced and your parents are kind of like you know they don't say it like i told you so so sometimes you should also remember i mean hopefully you have this kind of relationship with your parents where they really do love you and they really do care about you and their hesitation doesn't necessarily mean that and this is what we're seeing more and more with the internet right it's like i'll post about something on the internet and you know i'll it'll be full of my cognitive biases and i'll get like all kinds of support from the echo chamber and then i get really really upset by my nuclear family when they don't support me the same way is this echo chamber on the internet well there's like more to it than that right so hopefully you know what what i would strongly strongly recommend is that you facilitate conversation and you be patient and give them time it's possible that things don't end up going well that they really don't want to understand or they're not going to try to understand in which case you have my condolences but this is the other unfortunate thing is you can't force someone to understand right that's something that you can't do the best you can do is sort of tee things up for the highest probability of that happening so you got to be careful you
