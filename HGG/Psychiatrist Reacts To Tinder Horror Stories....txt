my name is Matt okay pleasure to meet you thank you a little bit about what online dating is like for you you know when I first started you know I had had kind of just too much time to really think about or like I guess overthink about a lot of things in life and um I also had very low self-esteem to be honest so yeah I don't know I just kind of spent six months going from like one dating app to the next you know trying different things and you know how it kind of started going though is um you know I would really try to kind of craft these like perfect messages like these perfect openers um you know which is always a very big struggle with dating apps is like trying to figure out how you want to present yourself at first but you know for me yeah it was I was very much overthinking it um and you know I was also trying to kind of figure out like what parts of my personality to hide um which was not good obviously and you know I realized that in retrospect but I think when you're first getting started with that you know you get a lot of rejection and you're trying to figure out why and you're like trying to look for those reasons and like okay what do I need to fix for next time you know so I don't get rejected and then how it kind of turned out though is you know I would get to the first date um and I would still try to kind of maintain that mask you know or like that that kind of character I created you know over text um this like you know kind of refined version I guess and so you know I would try to come off as like very like funny and knowledgeable and like charismatic and you know all these things and like I was so nervous about like letting the conversation die down and you know all these things and like you know it really became kind of a problem though because you know I I would never risk like actually flirting with the person you know like I would you know I I wouldn't tell jokes you know because I was so afraid they might not land or like I might offend them or like something like that it's like you know I was never actually flirting or anything and you know it's just kind of disastrous um you know and I I did that uh about six times I had like six first dates and yeah it was very difficult so yeah so I mean you're SP you almost sound like you're speaking in the past tense so are you flirting with people on dates now um so I guess to run through the story really quickly so after for you know a lot of those dates I did you know finally meet somebody um that like I had a lot more oh actually sorry let me back up really quick so you know after like six months of doing this I mean I was just exhausted I was so exhausted at like trying to figure out what I was doing wrong like trying to can I jump in with a couple questions actually oh yeah so when you say doing this what does doing this consist of can you help me understand like what was your like what what like if I was like following you around like what would I see on a weekly basis or daily basis I would say so like work was at a big like lull at the time so I just had loads of free time and you know I spent it you know doing some Hobbies but like a lot of it was just you know going from like you know you know I'd probably spend 30 minutes an hour a day just like popping from one dating app to the next like you know going through my matches like trying to message people um and again just like really trying to observe like okay like what am I doing right like what am I doing wrong you know why isn't this working why am I getting rejected and like I never really took the time to think about like and you know maybe it's just the wrong match whatever well so so so and what kind of answers would you come up with in your head when you would ask yourself like what am I doing wrong why am I getting rejected what what conclusions did you come to I think part of it was physical appearance I was pretty yeah I mean again I was coming from a place of very low self-esteem and everything but um as well as just like not being able to I think like effectively communicate with people and what um what were you trying to do in communication that's a good question I mean just I mean I think at the time I was kind of just desperate and like looking for really any kind of you know connection really like well he's really kind of just looking for whatever I could get and yeah okay so so it looked like you were feeling desperate and then you also mentioned you would try to like craft the perfect opener right so like thinking about and and what what would you what kind of conclusions did you kind of originally come to I recognize that you may have learned differently but when you were trying what did you think were the components of an uh perfect opener um I would have to say like it couldn't be lazy like I had to express like interest it had to show that like oh I'm funny and like you know interesting and like you know I read your bio so like I'm not just you know messaging like 20 different people and like you know I was trying to express like kind of like a distinct interest for you know this one person okay so you would like do like you would go through the bio and you'd like craft this message that had to be specific it sounds like and then you said try to be funny so can you give me an example of like how that would what that looks like that's a good okay if not that's okay yeah that's totally fine I mean I realized that it you know this was going on for months for like half an hour a day but um yeah trying to be funny which almost never works right you know you can be funny or not be funny but trying almost never works and then and so then I'm sorry I had interrupted you you were sort of um and then you also mentioned that you went on six First Dates can you tell us a little bit about what those were like I mean yeah I mean it was you know obviously very nerve-wracking because you're just meeting this totally random person that you've you know you've never been in a room with them so it's like you very much have like their kind of online version you know that you've been communicating with so far so you know oftentimes you get to the you know like wherever you guys are meeting or you know wherever I'm meeting and you know you see them and you're like oh well they're they're a bit different than I was expecting but like you know that could be a good or bad thing um and yeah I mean it half the time it really just kind of fell apart you know to be honest was was falling apart look like like just I mean like right now I feel like I'm kind of stumbling through this conversation and it's like that to like you know a higher degree like even you know significantly worse so just a lot of stumbling you know again like just no flirting like whatsoever like no actual flirting like just playing everything like super super super safe you know like that kind of thing if that makes sense it it sort of makes sense I I didn't get the impression you were stumbling through this conversation though I thought you've given me good answers to every question that I've asked except for one which is can you give me an example of an opening statement which like I totally understand like you haven't memorized them right from like six months ago so I think it's a reasonable thing to not be able to come up with yeah I exactly I've no idea what it was saying back then but yeah no it was exciting no it was a lot of stumbling and and you know just playing things like too safe and you know trying to put off like trying to maintain this mask in like such a nerve-wracking situation that like I just couldn't and like I I don't know okay I mean I guess it's possible maybe they didn't see it that way but can you tell me a little bit about this is very enlightening for me Matt so first of all I want to say thank you I I recognize that you know you mentioned yourself like I this is pure gold from my my standpoint is it okay if I ask you a couple other questions oh please yeah so so what like can you help me understand what was the mask that you were trying to put on like what were you trying to be during those dates that felt like it was really hard to accomplish I guess if I were to put it as simply as I could I was trying to make myself into as close as I could get to like I don't know like uh like uh Hollywood you know like very stereotypical like masculine you know man like again like very charismatic like stands up straight like can you know tell me about all the other things you're a very interesting person tell me about all the other things that you can like what is it tell me about the Hollywood man I love that I love that image what is uh what else does a Hollywood man do um I would say they can crack you know perfect jokes you know whenever whenever there's an opportunity um I would say you know they're chivalrous and you know everything like that they don't stumble on words they don't you know they they're very very effective communicators um and yeah I mean just again like very charismatic very you know all of those kind of stereotypical images that you know things that in many ways I am not or you know if I am it just takes me a while to get to that you know with somebody so what I I take a while to warm up totally understand dude so tell me what what does being charismatic look like I I think you know I think a lot of it really does just kind of censor around speech you know and how effectively you can communicate and like you know it's kind of the difference between you know you're in the shower and like thoughts are just flowing so easily and like you know you know like that version of yourself versus when you actually got get out of the world and you're super nervous and like you know it's a big difference or like if you're in like an argument with somebody you know it's like that kind of Separation I would say it makes perfect you know so like yeah so so like like you know I I love the example of shower thoughts right because everything makes so much sense in the shower did you ever consider asking someone out on a first date and shower together so that you could be your perfect self that no that that's a great that is a great idea though I totally wish I thought of that you know maybe next time because uh still looking for a next date anyway so so thank you so much Matt I thought that was incredibly incredibly helpful in terms of illustrating like what the experience of going through this dating stuff is like right so you're like trying really hard and then these charismatic Hollywood types are also like natural right that's a big part of it yeah they don't stumble through their words the words come out clearly they're relaxed they're confident but the harder that you are you try to do those things like the less of the Hollywood man you become right exactly after doing that for about six months I was just absolutely exhausted you know it's very emotionally kind of draining to do this and continually get rejected and then be like and then kind of beat yourself up you're like oh my God like I wasn't I wasn't the Hollywood man this time like I need to do it next time and like after a while like you just can't you just can't keep doing it so I mean you know I was about to delete all the apps honestly I was just about to give up I was like I'll just find somebody eventually in real life hopefully maybe not but um but anyway so you know I match um with my now X and you know the only thing on her profile is like mentioning oh I like play League of Legends and I'm like oh okay cool and like so the big change for me I guess was you know in my opening message I was just like oh cool like you know what champ do you play you know like I play league two and like she tells me and like it it's pretty much just you know easy from there and you know she actually asked me out on a first date and like we get there and you know it just it's like I finally found somebody that I could communicate easily with you know and the you know the whole conversation went great I remember coming home and like texting a friend I'm like I don't know if we're gonna end up dating but like we're definitely gonna be like lifelong friends you know so it was you know it was amazing um but okay so I don't want to kind of diverge from the kind of main topics too much but essentially you know we had to break it off for reasons neither of us really wanted um you know like probably five months ago now um and you know we kind of dragged things out had some communication issues um the whole thing was you know as I kind of would put it kind of world shattering to be honest you know like I I really had kind of a big breakdown of um I would have to say like my personality you know to be honest like I really kind of lost track of like who I am and you know the things I find important and you know the the word I I don't know the you know exact definition or anything but the word codependency does come to mind and like I do think there were some some uh issues with you know how I think I was using her to cope with a lot of my own kind of life problems and like as a distraction and I guess I should say that too like I think as a whole a lot of this online dating in my experience you know was a distraction from actually getting my life together wow so once yeah so once I was once we kind of broke up I was kind of plunged back into it and you know kind of left scrambling and like I didn't really feel like I had people to you know go to you know enough even though that wasn't true I have a great friend group but you know I felt very alone sure no I didn't have that person I could just text it in the middle of the night saying like hey I'm feeling kind of depressed and you know she would like talk to me about it you know so yeah and then you know now I'm kind of at a place where I am back to online dating but you know I've far reduced the number of apps that I'm using you know I've realized that it's good to just kind of slow burn in my experience okay um like not put too much attention to it and you know I've also realized it's best to you know not force connections um to not take things too personally um to be too impatient you know to dump all my heart into it like just pour my heart into you know this one thing that I want and also just having like kind of an appreciation for you know just forming General connections with women like it doesn't need to be like oh we're you know looking to get married and like there's all the pressure of that like sometimes it's best to just kind of be like hey like what's up you know like you're going to chat for a while like what are you interested in like just take it very slow casual and easy and yeah and just kind of appreciate that you know sometimes it just leads into a friendship maybe it just leads into like a nice little you know two-week conversation with somebody that you would would have never met before and you know like you can kind of just go your separate ways you know eventually so wow so I'm I'm hearing that you're really learning to just appreciate even the person for who they are and like even if it doesn't end up in a date like you can still have some this is the first time I've ever heard this so it's kind of blowing my mind but you can talk to someone on the internet on a dating app and then that conversation in and of itself can have value and also be like sufficient exactly that's wild and you could yeah and and but I mean so so but it sounds like you're not like trying to optimize everything exactly yeah so like now you know I feel like you know my bio like my dating bio is just very it feels a lot more like myself like I'm not trying to like I'm not trying to do a Hollywood man thing anymore like I'm just kind of like yeah you know like I like 3D printing and I like movies and I like cooking and you know just like I wanted to put like 3D printing on there before because I would have been like oh man girls find that too nerdy you know stuff like that but it's like then you're cutting off you know those connections with you know maybe there's a girl out there that does like 3D printing you know and and how awesome would that yeah so exactly no exactly so let me ask you kind of a tough question so do you have a sense though whether like this is actually like do you think is this working better though than than being like paranoid and trying to be something perfect and and like you know crafting these like opening lines yeah um first of all I think it's a lot better for my mental health okay far far better um but I also think that it just has a higher chance of finding meaningful connections and I I would say I've I have found it to work better like you know I've been back on dating apps for you know a couple months now after the breakup and like I haven't been on any like actual first dates like I have met um you know a friend I made but you know like I haven't been on any first dates but like I'm very kind of okay with that right now you know like I I you know I I think if I continue to put off that that image you know that Hollywood man thing like I could have probably found more first dates but I don't think they would have led anywhere so it's like what's the point that's so interesting it makes me really wonder about you know everyone like if the end point they're looking for is like going on the first date which actually I wonder if that sets them up for failure in terms of building a relationship I I think so I definitely think so interesting so it may be that there's a strategy that has fewer dates but more relationships or more dates and potentially fewer relationships yeah I I think so you know and I think a lot of it is just how how much you and oh my God let me tell you too I I remember hearing people say like oh just be yourself you know when I was first starting to date and like that that's such difficult advice to really I guess break down because it is true and like once you kind of learn that and like have been through it and kind of understand truly what that is and like what that means then it's like oh yeah like I can do that now but you know hearing that early on is is very difficult but so so yeah what would you say is hard why is that advice hard to implement like what have you learned now that was kind of hard to do before I was happy you know again it it really is just what kind of connections are you looking for and like realizing also that you know you can't you can't maintain it like at least in you know my experience I couldn't maintain that mask um in such a high pressure situation and like even if I could that would be really that's bad like you you're being dishonest you know it you know to the other person about who you are and and things so I don't know it's it to me it feels very much like something you just kind of have to get out there and experience it and kind of go through some trial and error and you know eventually I think kind of the natural conclusion is that but it's hard to reach until you've been through a lot of those experiences okay of course so I think there's there's a lot that you've kind of learned can I um did you share kind of what you were uh thinking about sharing today were there particular things that we didn't really talk about that you wanted to talk about um yeah I mean I I think that about covers it I mean you know obviously I've learned I've learned so much from this whole thing to be honest like I could trust me like I could go on for days without all the things I've learned but you know I think that about covers it do you want anything come to mind in terms of like like picking one or two things that you really wish you had known when you started out um oh uh yeah so another thing I would say is that it's important to try to understand how these I think these dating app algorithms kind of operate and understand that like when you first sign up to one they you know tend to kind of flood you with matches and like you know they basically promote your profile to a lot of people so you're like way more likely to get that and it kind of gets you hooked on it you know like At first you're like oh my God like I'm you know this is amazing and then they just you know like after a few days or whatever they just stop you know and you know then they start you know giving you ads about like hey like if you sign up for our premium you know a membership then you know we'll promote your profile again and like stuff like that and you know I I think it's it's very important to understand that like you probably didn't change anything like it's just how these algorithms work like it's not your I don't know maybe you changed the photo like one photo like it's probably not that that's like putting off everybody that sees it or whatever and you know I hope that kind of makes sense but yeah it makes a lot of sense it is important so Matt let me just um see if I can try to like summarize what what I heard from you and then you you know let us know if if we're missing stuff or so the first thing is that you were sort of in a in a little bit of a dark spot when you started dating and actually a quick question uh you said that you're you've cut back on the apps that you use are there particular apps that you think are better than others absolutely yeah which which are the good ones um so in my experience really the standout is Bumble okay um and and in that one you know the the uh woman um you know reaches out first okay um and I think it just kind of creates an environment of kind of safety for everybody and it's just a little less pressure and you know I that one's really kind of my standout personally okay and and which ones is there one in particular that you think is like should be avoided at all costs just wondering I mean there are but it would be kind of hard to think of what they all are okay let me let me say that there's a lot yeah okay okay so you you find Bumble sort of creates a safe space and as you know maybe leads to a more natural communication yeah I would say so okay so just to kind of recap um you know your experience on dating websites has been or apps has been like so you finished school you are not really in the best headspace at the time you also had a lot of time so it sounded like you you took the dating thing like pretty seriously in terms of like a Time investment maybe half an hour to an hour per day uh using many apps and then also like a lot of like optimization grinding thinking about it even maybe outside of the hour like you're thinking about it before and after and what should you say and things like that and so so it was almost like you were trying to figure out okay this is a puzzle that needs to be solved and if I spend enough time at it and if I spend enough like it's like a numbers game and I gotta grind and like optimize and if I can you know say something that is specific about their profile is funny and if I sort of try to like I'm gonna try to figure out how to live up to this Hollywood man kind of idea yeah you spent a lot of energy into that um you know you're you're trying to as you put it stand up straight right and you can crack the perfect joke at the right opportunity to be like kind of chivalrous but like maybe not too chivalrous like you don't want to be a nice guy right you're never like stumbling you're a bit risque you're like charismatic like people notice when you walk in the room they notice when you open your mouth like like people are kind of looking at you and like appreciating you and respecting you and and all that kind of good stuff but in trying to do all of that it was incredibly nerve-wracking incredibly like cognitively intense and since you're you're like trying to it's almost like you're I don't know how to say this but you're like hosting a server while you're trying to play a game right where you've got this like server where there's like all these interactions going on that are not the real you and it feels actually quite unnatural um conversations become very very forced you're kind of stumbling a lot a lot of like First Dates because maybe you were like oh look at me I'm so handsome but then when when you show up you end up kind of disappointing and then that leads to like this sense of like oh my God like I'm a loser I can't do it I have to be more like Chad like and I can't be Chad like I'm I'm Matt unfortunately and and then you ended up it sounds like what I'm gonna say this but what what really turned things around for you is matching with a girl who plays LOL yeah and then just at the right time too you know what I've just kind of all but given up yep and and so Along Came this girl who plays League of Legends and allowed you to be a little bit more natural allowed you to like you know shut down that that server that you're hosting and really focus on playing the game y'all entered into a relationship with which sounds like maybe y'all weren't really ready to be in a relationship even though you liked each other a lot and were a good match which I think I think that's a good way of putting it which is which I think is also really instructive because you hear a lot of this stuff where people are like work on yourself right and then people get really confused because they're like okay if I work on myself like how am I going to meet people but I I think as you kind of mentioned like you weren't really in a place to engage in a relationship and what does that look like I think sometimes that can look like using your partner to fit particular needs that you have that are not really relationship needs so if I'm lonely and the only person I have in my life is my partner like is that is that a certain antidote to loneliness sure but they can't be my entire Social Circle because if I make them my entire Social Circle it'll be smothering right and and so it sounds like y'all were just you look like you're about to say something you want to chime in oh no I was just saying uh no I think you're nailing it honestly yeah and God oh and you know a lot of these realizations you know did come you know afterwards as well I'll kind of ADD yeah of course and and so it sounds like y'all were really a little bit codependent and and maybe both you all were neglecting other parts of your life and I think unfortunately you can have the perfect match but uh you know when people say love conquers all like it's sort of but a Love or a relationship I don't think can be a substitute for other parts of your life not going well and so yeah it sounds like you all sort of amicably broke up yeah yeah I think we kind of realized you know it was more detrimental to the things we needed to get done in life and you know taking care of ourselves and yeah have to break it off unfortunately how very mature of you Matt oh thank you um and and so then now what you've kind of learned is that so first of all it sounds like you're aware that you are worthy of Love Yes or still no getting there I'm getting there nice honest answer man yeah so so I think that's that's actually really healthy right so like what I'm hearing is that some of the self-esteem issues some of the concerns still linger but now first of all like I love kind of where you are now so you're focusing on particular apps as opposed to others you're focusing on a slow burn as you put it to not be impatient and also to like not take things personally which I think is huge which is that you know if someone doesn't respond to you in a day or two it doesn't mean that there's something wrong with you because when you're trying to optimize you're like oh my God what if I said something else could I control this person's Behavior could I elicit more responses by changing the way that I communicate with them um and and really just appreciating the people for who they are and and like even if things don't turn into a date like that's okay and better to sort of have an honest conversation where you kind of don't waste your time on on dating and and that's really wild like you know because it's it's it's really it really sounds Wild yeah but I mean it it sounds like you're also taking care of the other stuff in your life that really needs to be taken care of yeah definitely you know after um you know very luckily I uh got into therapy like right as we were about to break up so you know I and you know it's it's funny too because I started therapy thinking you know really I think kind of a big reason for it was to handle the breakup but you know as it turns out I I wasn't ready for a lot of other things in my life like I you know had a lot of other things to work on and you know what I'm yeah awesome dude well listen Matt I'm I'm really optimistic for you like um you know it sounds like you're approaching this in a really like healthy way like you've come away with some like good lessons and you're kind of working on yourself and really being a little bit more honest with the internet about who you are and also through the work that you're doing offering up like a better version of Matt because you tried the the scuffed version and and you know you need a little bit of Polish and like that's okay I think that that's not doesn't mean that you're you know like I think like working on your esteem in a very like reasonable and healthy way yeah yeah any I appreciate all that yeah I mean I appreciate I I mean I thought you did such a good job of sharing your journey with us thank you any last uh thoughts or questions I I don't really have I I thought you were actually very good huh I I was saying I think that's about it I also do have uh therapy starting in like literally like three minutes okay well I do have to kind of get going oh well perfect dude perfect timing all right take care buddy thank you you too have a good one hello hello okay let me just close the stream real quick there it is there we go what's your name my friend uh my name is Carlos and um can you tell us a little bit Carlos about what online dating has been like for you uh it's not been great honestly um so for context I'm in my early 30s okay never been in any kind of uh romantic relationship and uh I think I've been getting on and off online dating for like since dinner was around maybe the first years so I had to say like um how many years is that like nine years okay maybe okay and I tried a few the apps like uh did you say you haven't been in a relationship I've never been okay okay up to now yeah okay yeah keep going please so yeah um I I tried a few apps like uh Tinder bamboo match.com you name it um and I've never had like actual success in any of the applications but I think when things started getting um maybe like complicated or started I started developing a new healthy relationship with the application was probably in the last four years when I got on this cycle language I felt lonely downloaded Tinder um try to do some swipes and uh without a lot of success and uh after that it eventually gets to me uh this feeling of inadequacy that that I won't ever be able to make things work so I get very depressed to say a word and uh and I get up the application and I stay up the application for a few months and then uh the loneliness or worried on kind of kicks in again and like get on the applications again um the cycled repeats and that probably lasted for about three four years and interestingly enough what broke the cycle was when I actually made a connection with a girl and she was very much into me and she pushed really hard to make things work and uh that made me panic a little bit and I ended up like pushing her away um so that kind of made me realize that I was probably not ready for a relationship on one hand and on the other that I was using the application these applications to kind of reinforce this idea that I was not good enough for a relationship so to speak um so that's I kind of realized this and I decided not to go again on the applications I've been I think of them for like a year after this interaction and I recently deleted my profiles maybe a couple weeks ago because I kind of got it in a relationship so I didn't want those profiles to cause any issues so I deleted them wait so so um this was not the person that you pushed away no she was not um and that experience made me feel bad because this girl was very clear with what she wanted and she was very assertive and she gave a lot from her to make things work and I wasn't able to like open up to her and tell her that I wasn't feeling that much into it so at some point she told me like the things were not working for her that she wanted to break it up so to speak um wait so I'm a little bit confused so it sounded like after you went off oh sorry sorry you started dating someone and then you uninstalled the apps yeah that was recently and and are you still dating that person I don't know okay so it's it's rough at the moment yeah it's rough at the moment but did you is that someone that you met on the apps no no um so just to clarify this girl that I was talking about that I met in the app that was like one year ago yeah right so that because it seems like two different people so I'm just trying to yeah yeah it's two different people and the girl that I was dating actually was a friend of mine and we've been friends for like 15 years oh boy yeah but it sounds like it's kind of complicated it's complicated yeah there's too many layers to it okay so can I um was there something else that you like uh or did you want to say more Carlos I think that's uh that sums up like my experience with dating apps sure can I can I ask some questions of course okay so it sounds like you you started with Tinder early like oh yeah back before it was cool but it's a yeah when it was cool let's say like the media was talking about it and it seemed like a easy way to try to solve this problem right this loneliness that I had but what ends up ended up happening is that this Tinder became like uh more of a hookup app so people were it's very superficial I I think so people are not many times or looking for a committed relationship yep um I'm looking for something more real though when Tinder becomes this thing on which people are just looking for something very superficial I think it never worked for me it hasn't worked for me I see and and so for the first five years that you were using Tinder you mentioned that like you know later it got kind of like into this toxic cycle but for the first five years what was your experience like um it wasn't really remarkable basically I just uh made the profile I read all of the tips that they gave you so uh you were talking before uh this opening lines and profiles and all that stuff I read it I tried to do it but I didn't also want to put too much effort into it um because I also don't like to present myself as someone that I'm not okay so if I'm going to meet someone I expect that person to like me for who I am and not because I'm not for something that I'm not and then in the first few years I mean were you dating people on the app and things didn't work out or what was your or were you not like because I think there's like matching and then you know you'll talk to people online and then sometimes you'll go on date sometimes they'll turn into hookups sometimes they'll turn into relationships what was your experience like for the first few years I've never gone into a date with anyone from online dating basically okay and what's your understanding of how that's happened um it's a variety of things uh for me I think it's very difficult to to build some connection or on text only Okay so I also feel that there's like an expectation to for the man to be the one who like drives things forward and uh I I find that very like discouraging because I'm kind of expecting if we're two people that are supposed to be somewhat interested in each other I see I'm expecting it to to like build this together right but it seems like the expectation is that I had to entertain got it so for me it's very difficult to build those connections over text and when it finally happens I discovered that my fear of intimacy kicks in so I have like maybe two three people that have been actually interested in going out with me but I kind of panic and don't know what to do so I just leave it there okay so now Carlos I'm hearing like a couple of different things can I just think for a second of course is it okay that I'm asking you these questions yes yes it is okay so the first thing that I kind of want to comment on is that first of all like your look it sounds like you're looking for like a real relationship like a partnership right um so so and and so the the first kind of challenge is that there's this discrepancy between what you're looking for and what the expectation is so the expectation sounds like that the man leads and what you're really looking for is like a partnership where like both people are interested each other and both people drive the conversation forward right and so if someone is expecting you to take the lead it sounds like you don't really play that game very well that's right and it feels somewhat inauthentic or unfair to you yeah it does does it feel both of those things are one more than the other or what I think it's more the last one it kind of bothers me that I have to I mean yeah it feels unfair the relationship at the end yeah it goes unfair okay and then then it sounds like but there are some some people who who've expressed interest in you and and when they so like it sounds like when they actually like start you know I don't know how to say it's trying to move the relationship forward you you said something about panic and fear of intimacy right can you tell me about that um yeah so for example there was one connection that I had like maybe three four years ago um so the conversation was going well we took it from the application to another messaging application of the dating app uh the conversation was really going well but then the girl I think told me she wanted to meet me and uh I don't know there's there's this like very strong feeling of of fear or I don't know it's it's hard to describe but I wasn't like very sure what to do and um that particular time I just become a little less responsive on the on a conversation I didn't cut communication but she ended up like getting tired and eventually lost at me like I tried to reach out and she didn't respond so I how do you understand that and how do you feel about that um I understand it like uh women naturally don't want to waste their time with someone that's not showing interest 100 so um I didn't I don't feel resentful for that kind of interactions because at the end I know that's kind of for me and that there's things that I have to work on hmm so yeah and okay and what do you what do you think it is that you have to work on it's I have very caring experiences regarding dating a love life because of all of it it's very hard for me to open up uh so yeah I mean I I feared rejection a lot interesting and even though even though they show interest I have this fear that they will leave that they realize maybe they didn't like me as much and that connection so I even though I'm longing for this a romantic relationship I end up sabotaging a lot of a lot of it so I think that's very insightful um I'm just gonna point out to you that it's kind of tricky right because on the one hand it sounds like you're looking for someone else to be an equal partner and that you find it frustrating that men are expected to take the lead but right when the people that express interest in you and and sort of share that responsibility and y'all are like talking back and forth right and instead of I mean it sort of sounds like and then if a woman asks you out you kind of retreat so it's like on the one hand if you're taking the lead that's sort of unfair but on the other hand if they're taking the lead or even share the lead with you it sounds like it kind of triggers this Panic response right that's how it's tough dude it has been really tough yeah because it's sort of like when they give you what you want you kind of pull away yeah how do you understand that or what do you think about that I think I'm still processing it and uh the relationship that it was kind of in recently kind of helped me understand a lot of it and work through many things right so what happened was um this friend of mine of many years pretty much told me she had a crush on me and initially my first um reaction was to push away again right I wanted to run from it um but then I I calmed down I thought about it like well I'm like okay I think I'd like this friend too so I told her I like her back and uh up until some point it had been a very um nice experience because I was able to fight those fears and uh overcome many of it um because I think the key Point here is that I really like this person like this person and I trust her that she wouldn't hurt me so I think there's that's a big component like that I know I don't know if I can trust that the other person won't hurt me I guess what's wrong with being hurt um it's tough certainly yeah um so far I haven't had like a positive romantic experience in my life so um I guess I haven't processed those emotions from previous events properly maybe so yeah I mean I I think that you know the other thing the last thing that I kind of want to touch on is is that you were talking about this like four year cycle of of toxicity where you are essentially using Tinder as an antidote to loneliness and then it wasn't kind of working out for you right and that sort of makes sense to me because if you show up on the app and the main thing that you're feeling is lonely then I think that that's not going to be the most conducive to forming connections right and it almost sounds to me like a little bit like sort of self-sabotage where if you're lonely and you kind of show up and that's what you're really putting forward either consciously or subconsciously then when things don't work out you wind up feeling hopeless and then you like kind of quit the app until the loneliness gets unbearable again and you have to do something honestly you know what that kind of reminds me of Carlos it kind of reminds me of like patients that I've worked with who have addictions where like the Cravings get really really really bad and you know it's like not gonna really help you but you sort of like have to start using like it this whole like starting and stopping cycle reminds me actually a lot of like people who are struggling with addiction hmm just that you kind of use it as an antidote to loneliness it doesn't actually fix your problem and then you end up feeling hopeless and you kind of like you're like never again and you quit right is that sort of what it feels like for you that you kind of feel like okay never again this is stupid like and then you quit yeah it is it is yeah that's it it's really interesting I think there's all kinds of stuff going on with dating apps and and we're not really sure how they're affecting our psychology yeah totally um because it's kind of like a gambling sort of I mean you're just waiting for that because you're swiping profiles and eventually you get that reward of the match right so you have like this rewards cycle that makes you go back to it eventually yeah I mean I I don't work at the end I think they're quite intentionally designed that way right right so Carlos um any so kind of where are you now like how do you how do you feel about the future how do you feel about yourself like what do you think do you have a road forward what does it look like uh I'm quite unsure um because of this um dating situation that I'm in um it's not looking very hopeful but at the same time um this made me work a lot of my on myself I think this last experience so I'm feeling a bit more hopeful of the future in general I'm just not so sure about my current situation and do you mind if I ask what makes you not very hopeful about the current situation you don't have to say it if you you don't want to I'm just kind of curious uh it's complicated let's say um the person that I was starting that relationship with it's dealing with a lot she's rather very rough year I see um so I think she's not in a very even though she started uh all this process I think she's not currently on a good State of Mind okay so it's probably not a good time to start a relationship I guess I see okay so it's it's not it's not necessarily the person it's more that like the current situation that y'all are in or not is not really conducive to a relationship I think so yeah makes a lot of sense yeah man that sounds rough I mean I'm I you know I think the one thing that I would kind of share with you is is I don't know if you're kind of working on yourself in some ways so it sounds like this relationship has helped you sort of dig into the fear of intimacy and connection and rejection um but it sounds like you you need to continue to do some personal work to to really help yourself be in a good headspace to make things happen on on the Romantic front right yeah um I've been going to therapy for a few years but um and I've been talking about this sort of relationship with my therapist and she told me like she didn't want to touch on the topic because she knew that it was kind of painful for me so we've been focusing more on like professional stuff uh so I think it's a good opportunity opportunity to get back to it yeah I mean the therapist didn't want to talk about it because it would hurt you I seen here that it was a sensitive topic and I that I wasn't really focusing on it so we were um working on others aspects aspects of my life based on your therapist's direction or yours okay that makes a lot of sense yeah so so it sounds like she kind of gave you the opportunity to not talk about it and you were like yeah let's do that yeah that was it yeah okay yeah I mean well so so Carlos I'm I'm glad you're you know you have some support it sounds like you're walking a good journey even if the road is a little bit bumpy and things are a little bit hard but it sounds like you're you're really like working at it very intentionally and and I'm hopeful for you because of that because thank you I mean it really sounds to me like a lot of where you are right now has a lot to do with you just as much as like the apps or other things because you know does that make sense yeah yeah it does it does yeah so the good news about you know if it's your fault I'm not saying that everything here is your fault but if you have some degree of responsibility here the good news is that's in your control right whereas one of the most frustrating things that I hear when I've talked to other people like more privately about their experience with dating apps is that the more that they sort of blame the internet and blame other people blame a particular gender is that it sort of means that the solution you know they're not in control of the solution whereas the more responsibility you accept you know that that is actually something that's within your power to change and so it can actually be like quite empowering yes that's right cool any other thoughts or questions before we wrap up no I think that that would be a good point to stop it yeah so so thank you so much for for sharing Carlos and I especially thought it was very like eye-opening about um you know even in situations where people were like kind of pushing to form a connection that you sort of had this instinctive response and I imagine that a lot of people are actually like that the problem is we don't talk about it that sometimes even the exact thing that you want from a dating app is the thing that causes you to panic the most and then that in turn leads to a lot of like shame and self-judgment because you're like oh I wanted this and then I screwed it up right so thank thank you very much for vocalizing those feelings in that experience thank you take care man hello can you hear me hello yes I can hear you yeah unfortunately my um video camera is like not working right now so totally fine okay what do you go by my friend um can you call me like flow like flow is my nickname actually absolutely it's flow right yeah okay yeah I'd I'd love to call you flow so what's what's been your experience with online dating flow um yeah um so my experience was I guess to summarize it was like I had some like decent success but um like overall I guess at the same time you know like even the success kind of make me feel a bit cynical overall um the the reason I said that was because um because initially when I started using the dating by solo like follow like some specific formula um and like I kind of saw like got quite a few matches and like went on dates and stuff and potentially too long-term relationship from that but I guess um I guess it was like few years ago where I started to be more of myself with a mechanic I like um and but I don't know because of that I got more like flaky I don't know something like that like being ghosted something like that and so I was sort of like feeling cynical in a sense that like being myself isn't really an option okay um so yeah that's a summary of it basically wow that sounds uh first of all really interesting but also like really rough because it sounds like you sort of figured out the formula right and and you figured out how to get into dates and potentially even two real relationships if you're kind of being fake yeah that was a bit uh a bit more interesting nuances like those two long-term relationship well I I said long term but I'm not really sure if this qualifies long term because it's like um three to four months and I know that sounds funny because um like that's literally the longest I've ever been in a relationship like I mean like okay well I mean it sounds like a relationship right three or four months yeah something that um but the nuances was because um those two was more like I was being myself I'm not sure like um something like that but you were being yourself yeah I know like I know I've had to sound like contradicting myself right now um that is how should I put it um like I got a couple of like because I started off like very like I'm I'm confident in myself basically I don't believe like let me I'm not worried at all about you contradicting yourself that's that's where the Nuance is and I think that's where you know that's where the real learning is I don't consider it a problem if you make two statements that are contradictory in fact I think as we explore that exactly kind of like what you're doing that's where we're really gonna find the money but can I can I kind of go back and ask a couple questions sure so you said that you sort of figured out a formula that seemed to work can you can you clue Us in on the secret formula that gets you dates on dating apps yeah it was I was getting good angles um doing interesting stuff what do you mean by good angles well just about the lightning better pulses so pictures of pictures of you yeah like more complementary of my looks basically I see okay and and are you a your you identify as a man oh yeah yeah and you're interested in women yeah and would you say you're a good looking guy Flo no um no I I don't think so like I'm quite ever okay so you're quite average but you figured out how to you know take pictures with good lighting and good angles to really like optimize you know and and so you talked about angles and then so what else did you sort of figure out helps well I don't know like it's gonna make me sound obnoxious but like I have six paths I mean like I look very good like physically so I I can't kind of kept that like capitalize on that I suppose so so you you said you have a six pack I mean yeah just basically like shirtless pictures and like that I see okay so shirtless pictures and it sounds like you're a swolder like you exercise oh well yeah something like that okay and and so but you consider yourself average looking I mean yeah like um face wash face wise okay so it sounds and let me know flow if I overstep okay because I'm gonna is it okay if I like meme with you a little bit or you want me to stay serious I mean I'm fine I'm fine with it okay I'm okay with it you look well can I trust you to let me know if I say something that's out of line yeah sure okay so basically you're taking pictures of stuff besides your face no no no that's that's definitely not I know nobody else funny but yeah foreign so it sounds like you're you're in good shape and you learned how to take good pictures what else is part of the the formula I mean I was just being more playful in general what does that mean well like it sounds cringy but well I I mean well I mean it's not right because it worked oh yeah it's I don't know I I first it's been it's been like a year since that place I kind of forgot about it but it's something like I just do some very random weird pickup line in my bio or something like hi I'm trouble and like I don't know I'm just basically presenting myself in a way that I'm a bad match like it's all like you know like rather than saying like I'm a good match and to say like you know like it's sort of like reverse psychology it's just like in a playful way you know playful yeah so what I'm what I'm hearing is you're sort of sarcastically saying that you're not a good fit which implies that you actually are a good fit uh something like that I suppose okay so it so it it sends across some amount of playfulness and and you know like you could take a picture of your six-pack and you can say something like yeah I'm really overweight you know and and I need to go on a diet like something like that yeah something like that okay so you were being playful yeah and um anything else that's on your recipe for success no I guess that's pretty much it okay and then just just one I suppose I don't really swipe a lot because like it's just more like algorithm thing because the more you saw it the more efficient like the less matches you get the it tends to because the at least at least for Tinder from from what I understood is that that's all right pushed on your ring if it's like so yeah something like that but yeah so so you're you're a a rank you play the game of rank so if someone swipes right on you so there's some kind of ratio of like how many people swipe right on you and how many people do you swipe right on and if you swipe right on a lot of people but not many people swipe right on you that lowers your rank right yeah so you're you're kind of calculating with how you swipe yeah okay so thank you so much for sharing all this flow I'm sure a lot of people have learned a lot from um you know a mini Chad like yourself because you're not a giga chat right yeah I'm not many manychat is fair yeah sure so so then you were telling me that you started to feel a little bit more cynical and you started getting ghosted like help me understand so you're you're getting matches with people are you going on dates yeah yeah I'm going on dates and how are those going um are you are you implying the the part where I feel more cynical or no I mean so like walk me through the process right so we've understand you're making profiles you match with people you're texting back and forth can you actually tell me about the texting back and forth like what that's like in your case I've never used Tinder bro so you gotta like really lay it out for me oh yeah um so I don't know like like you know if let's say if let's say I'm actually unless a mattress 20 goes this week and like like statistically speaking like I could get like 10 of them being more like basically 50 of them being more like enthusiastic with me where whereas the other 50 percent is just like yeah I'm not really that interested I just thought it looked cool you know but so then from there the the the ten girls stand us giving like a rough number right so and then maybe like there's two or three who really want to go out with me then so um then from the I focus in on that poetry and and I just get their number and try to strike what the iron is called something like that because you can't delay it too long because I know there's a lot of guys who would want to ask them out too so okay something like that and and so it sounds like getting their numbers not hard for you I mean yeah but number is just number okay and and so what do you what do you usually do to get their number I mean no I'm just saying like do you want to I don't know oh it depends on my mood right like I don't really use it but it's more like a fancy a drink with a cute guy sometimes so something just being being like sarcastically playful fine [ __ ] Chad my dude no but yeah it depends on my mood when I when I say that how does that make you feel well I feel like impossible because I know I'm not um but yeah okay Yeah so basically that's it um yeah okay so so it okay all right so okay so so you you get sorry um so it sounds like you get their number and then you you recognize that it's important to act quickly right because like attention spans are short in the day of in the age of online dating yeah and um and so then you get their number and then you call them and then what happens or you text them or what I don't know what you all do nowadays I mean it depends something like that sometimes cold and you know just um it depends if if it depends on the girl usually if they'll prefer coffee I'll go for coffee that before like you know just some night dreams and you know just see where it goes from there it really depends on the girl okay and and what are your dates usually like um well just getting to know each other and stuff when you know if and usually I see how she's feeling me at the moment and I will see I mean we will see where it goes okay and and so do you do you tend to enjoy those um yeah um half the time so like I I remember like there was this earlier on there was this one I forgot who who mentioned this uh which is the the problem with getting a lot of days is you know it is it's not I mean so so like there's two scenario like like you have you have like a bigger pool sample but there's less likely of people that actually match you whereas if you go the other route where is uh the other route which is you filter out all these people that you as I mean like in the sense that you're being really extremely picky um then I I don't know I just feel like bringing that up yeah so that that sounds important so what I'm what I'm hearing there is that you made a profile that got a lot of people interested in a shallow way but that you ended up being a little bit disappointed by the lack of real connection um yeah yeah I would say I will say so like like early on because I started like this online dating seriously around 2016. like early on I didn't really care that much uh like you know because because the the validation and everything was kind of interesting so I don't really care that much and you know once after like two years maybe I prefer something else that's when I start to feel like yeah this is kind of there's a big [ __ ] it's a bit [ __ ] like okay and and so can you tell me a little bit about these two relationships and how you started like what happened how you got ghosted how you became cynical oh yeah um it was I guess you saw us around 2020 um I guess so around that during the pandemic uh I was just like you know what if I just try to be more of myself uh like I don't know like even even in testing in general like um you know I just like maybe more more of like a friendly conversation rather than a floaty one you know like just really get to know that person and stuff and um that usually tends to lead to I don't know like less reaction I guess because I don't know um girls respond more towards floaty stuff and friendly approach tends to be less effective but that's one thing the other thing was when I like let's say I got this girl out and something like that like I don't know how to put it nicely but basically early on I was more um I don't know I I wish it's like I was more cold I was more emotionally guarded I don't really let them know what I'm feeling and I'll later on wish you know I was more like if I really like to go I'll express it so what would you say I don't know it's a very uncontrollable unconscious um I cannot control it sometimes it's almost like I mean I I'm not I'm not love bombing I'm yeah you know I'm not doing those sort of things but it's just more like I really like you like um I just want to let you know because uh I can't control myself around you or something like that I was being honest that's how I feel and you know I guess the girl got freak out or something and there's a lot more you know similar cases after that or I'm not sure maybe it's just my biases but it kind of feels like that um okay um yeah so floor I'm going to ask you a couple of specifics here do you do you you say something like like quite literally like I can't control myself around you um I mean it's it's so long until my I mean like two years ago so I kind of like okay I can't really remember that specification but it's something like that something like that and and I'm detecting an accent do you speak other languages uh speak Chinese okay so um and and when you're talking with these girls are you speaking in English or Chinese uh usually mostly English okay and and how and so once you say something like that you're guessing that and so then they pull away is that fair um yeah it kind of feels like that it feels like that it's more like it's not like so it so it's not like that it's totally stop replying to my text but you sure it's just kind of feel like it becomes harder to get them to talk to me so I don't I just don't put in the effort after that you know if that makes sense okay because I just feel like there are less enthusiastic like I I'm I'm not willing to put myself through that because I know how this goes I've been in that position before so you stop putting in as much effort yeah well as as soon as I detect the the Enthusiast like like for example I would say something like hey you wanna get a drink next week and then I was like I'll see how as opposed to um yeah sure I'll I'll let you know you know and then like I will wait until that day and then there's no like initiative from them so I was like yeah I don't feel like initiating and and how many how many girls have you said that to you mean like I feel yeah that I'm really into you um yeah like right this is this is like the nuances I'm just it's like I don't really explicitly say that all the time yep I I don't know it's just like like okay like two months ago um so this girl well I met her through not not like anything but someplace else but so so so basically it's something like I became more emotionally vulnerable I mean in the sense that I um I don't know like I just asked a lot of questions like hey how are you doing you know like um not not like excessively but basically like I don't know how to pull it like I know my frequency kind of like increase a bit about the frequency of communication with them oh yeah like you know like I said like rather than rather than letting them wait I mean like you know so like creating the anticipation for them I I just saw like just like a lot like why should I play this game right like if I'm really interested in them I would just talk to them more right and then and then like I talk to them it's not even a lot you know and then I feel like they are pulling away I can just feel it and the reason why I say I can feel it is because um like I know they read my test and I saw them posting some you know like sharing some stories on Instagram like I know they are active and stuff and they are purposefully ignoring my messages and then I just left it there and then like maybe two three days later I just feel like you know what I'm not gonna eat [ __ ] you know like like I'm not gonna play that game so I just blocked them something like that okay and and so I'm still a little bit thank you for illustrating how that plays out how often do you go down this road of like sharing your feelings with the women that you're dating or talking to does it happen like a lot very little like are we talking like two times three times ten times 20 times um I think it was like eight times okay so that's a fair number six yeah six to eight times and and it it has never really worked out with you yeah I guess so like I'm trying to be like I don't know like I'm not sure if I'm just being biased I don't know like it's very hard to recall those experiences of course yeah yeah and and so uh Flo I'm a little bit uh Curious like I mean so so bro it sounds like you really like care about some of these women that you're really kind of like into them that you're really looking for like a real relationship and how does it feel to kind of Express some of your more vulnerable emotions and kind of have them pull away like eight times dude how do you feel about it maybe yeah maybe that time was exaggerating like maybe six times but but yeah um how do I feel about it well I'd like to be honest um I've I don't know if this is the right word to express it I but I almost feel a bit like in cell at that moment like I feel like there's there's this part of me that feels like okay there's this solo I I just want to like generally generalized woman right like say you know girls are like that because I'm I was feeling hurt so I might like a part of me want to you know just rationalize how it is how I don't know um so I was hurt I was I was very very very very uh yeah I was so super down two months ago yeah and and what do you do with those feelings of being hurt or being down how do you deal with those oh yeah I mean I feel like this is another Topic in itself but to some to to make it long story short I I struggle I have like very bad coping mechanism so sure oh yeah oh yeah but that being said one of the worst thing which I thankfully I stopped doing now it was in the past when I feel hurt I would talk to more women you know as as it's almost like it's almost like yeah who cares about that girl no my equal let's talk about another one so it's like very just uh because I can't deal with that emotion sorry yeah yeah okay yeah can I think for a second flow sure any anything that you want to ask or anything else that you want to add um well I just want to add like I understand that I have like this cynical part of me like being myself is just never gonna work I know that's false but yeah okay that's all um would you say that uh you're good at expressing your emotions oh yes I I think I am I mean at least the past two years ever since the pandemia I've been working on that I feel that I'm very good on that so yeah okay and and do you have like close friends or family that you can discuss like deep and personal things with um I have thankfully a couple of one or two three friends I can talk to you about this so yeah I'm thankful okay and and I'm gonna ask you kind of a weird question Flo are you worth loving uh yeah that's an interesting question I mean yeah but you know there are times when I struggle with this a lot past few months ago so I mean now it's more like leaning more towards yes basically leaning more towards yes yeah it's not like a hundred percent yes I mean are you sure you're leaning more towards yes I mean I think so I mean I I say that because I'm more forgiving towards myself when I make mistake and all that I mean the past I was very very critical myself okay yeah so it sounds like you you're worth loving you deserve your love oh yeah yeah right do you deserve other people's love I mean or are you worth loving by other people I mean I think so I mean yeah okay okay okay I'm really happy to hear that because so here's so here's what I'm hearing flow a couple of interesting things okay the first is that so you tossed out the word imposter earlier so like it sounds like you are uh a average looking guy but it sounds like you get a fair number of matches it sounds like you get a lot of women who are at least surface interested in you it also sounds like the way that you play the game is to select for those kinds of women right so like you're you're yeah and you you know you know kind of like how to behave like a chad I guess so right and so so which is which is cool like I I wouldn't advise you necessarily to do anything different right so I think that being like flirtatious being being a little bit you know and if you if you you know are proud of your physical form and sort of advertising that I think is like completely reasonable and then what it sounds like is that you get into these situations where you really start to catch feelings for a girl and then you sort of like change your tune a little bit you start to kind of like say hey I'm like super into you and then you notice that they kind of pull away when you do that and that that happens consistently yeah and and then now okay yeah um no um no it's just well I mean I will elaborate after I hear you no no keep going elaborate now bro okay well I feel like this is a bit different topic early on you mentioned like uh you mentioned how I talk about I was feeling like an imposter like one thing I want to elaborate on that was also because like that's something I just realized was I I I'm not oftentimes I think about it is all the girls that I had like gone out and dating from from online dating I always wonder that if I met them in real life would that be interested in me and I say this because I never um I I don't know I I don't I feel that if I met them in like Social Circle in real life they wouldn't bet an eye on me like it is just how I feel unless you're sure yeah I don't know like and and it's it's not just like you know Concord shoulders or whatever it's also like something about online dating I can just show the best side of me and like I feel that if I were to meet them in you know social setting or whatever I'm just like a hopeless you know I just I don't know this is how I feel yeah and and sorry for making a joke that was making light of your feelings I I think that that no no no no yeah it makes I think it makes a lot of sense because I I think that so let me so let me put it back to you this way okay so if you're hmm let me think about how to ask this so it if you met them in person do you think that they would be interested like I yeah I don't know the question of the day I I just don't know like no no I feel like it's no yeah yeah yeah I mean the answer is no yeah yeah right and so when I ask you like are you like worthy of love like what I'm maybe that's so it sounds like you've worked on yourself a lot and like super proud of you bro and and also that it sounds like you really like lack a lot of confidence and what I'm concerned about is that I do think there could be some amount of cognitive bias um especially if because I I think the other thing to kind of think about is that I think when you express like authentic feelings with people yeah it's a it's like a shift right and so I think sometimes it takes people like time to process that yeah and and I'm I'm kind of curious like do you ever tell people in person or it's usually over text uh in person and how do they respond I mean I wish I have more time to recall that okay the memory and but um and is there protect what determines whether you tell them or not like say like let's say you catch feelings for a girl what determines like when you say it or what determines when I say it yeah I don't know I just say at the end of the day something like that I know but why at the end of that date as opposed to like a week later or two weeks later or three weeks later oh um I don't know I just I just feel like I I I'm too old to play this [ __ ] I mean this game yeah I mean I'm 28 um too young but on the others yeah yeah so so I mean for like I think there are a couple things here one is that I wonder if you're writing off women too quickly So when you say like like I'm too old to play this [ __ ] or you know like I don't have time for these games now that I've confessed my feelings like now I suddenly have no more time for games but up until you confess your feelings it's like it's games all day long the uh right yeah so so I I think no go ahead yeah no go ahead no I was just saying like the most recent one which was I don't know like like the the girl that I said I block her because she she didn't reply to me I I don't see any reason why I need to initiate the conversation after I wait so what amount of time between you telling her and how long between confessing your feelings and blocking I mean so so so this the most recent goal that um column core I blocked her was just I was because she was feeling sick that day and um I was just asking like hey are you feeling better like yada yada yada and like um she didn't reply and then like two three days later she still didn't reply and then I saw her like being active on Instagram like um posting story and that stuff and I was like yeah I don't want to play this game and then I just block her so we're talking about 72 hours between confessing feelings and blocking yeah I wouldn't say yeah it's not really like confessing right it's more like I was explicitly showing more sure um sure my feeling but for context wise for context like this particular like very quickly um she was the one who keep flirting with me like she she like so so like yeah she knows that I like her so okay okay yeah but whoa so here's here okay so like yeah all right so I'm gonna start off by saying like I could be wrong about this okay definitely I don't know nothing about online dating so but here's I want you to try to put yourself in hers shoes for a second so here she is you're flirting with her she's flirting with you it's all fun and games yeah right and so then like imagine that you like like escalate some right so you're like hey like I'm actually like really into you now how would it feel if she just went back like back to just the general flirting if she like gave you a wink wink a nudge nudge an eggplant emoji and a thumbs up laughs yeah um I know oh I take that as a positive sign rather than you know okay okay okay so so I think I think I'm learning a lot here okay so so my point is that okay so like let's say like me and you are playing a game of I don't even know what but if you like escalate on me I can't keep playing down here yeah you get that yeah like she can't leave that she's gotta match your intent like you can't just ignore what you said and keep on flirting I guess so does that make sense yeah it makes sense I never constitute of that but yeah yeah that's interesting so and I think there's a lot that's going on because like here you are blocking them like you see them on Instagram but it's like if someone like Flo if you were to confess your love for me right now yeah I would need time to process right especially if I'm Into You okay does that and I think what's going on is that that deep down you feel to a certain degree unlovable we're just going to call it that I know you're working on it and it's okay for things to be contradictory because that's how our brain works right so it's like do I want to eat you know like do I want to eat one thing or another thing like I want both and I want neither one so like sometimes human beings are conflicted and I think what what I'm hearing honestly is that it sounds like you're very very sensitive to rejection if you have like made yourself vulnerable and so before they even reject you or accept you it's like you can't wait in the waiting room and it like feels so terrible that you just end up blocking them yeah right yeah because what are you really when you block them what what can't happen if you block them I mean I blocked them for my peace of mind basically like I just don't want to think about it something like that exactly right so it's intolerance of your own limbo yeah you understand limbo yeah um I guess um I can Google it later um let me try to think about uh so so like uncertainty oh yeah right so so like like but my point is that I I don't I mean I I think you're kind of shooting yourself in the foot like bluntly because I think that sometimes when and I realize I'm generalizing here which is not something that we want to do but I'm just going to use this generalization it's true of men and women but I'm going to use the word women okay yeah so I think she like needs time to process because here's like this mini Chad flow with his six pack and his flirting and all this kind of stuff and then suddenly in a moment Flo you have become every woman's dream which is a sexy playboy who has feelings and is actually into you instead of being a sexy playboy who's gonna date you and then just like move on to someone else and then like that's a lot for people to handle because the rules of the game have changed and sometimes they need a little bit of time I'm thinking about it yeah but I could be wrong and and so the next thing is that when you block them like then it gives you peace of mind but just think about what you're doing there is for your peace of mind you're actually like you're you're not giving them the chance to like process and like come back to you does that make sense um yeah I can I can think of I can think of one or two scenario who that fall into that category but yeah right and and okay so so fair right so then we also have to acknowledge that maybe like four out of the six weren't looking for a serious emotional commitment and when you signal that they get less interested yeah yeah I think definitely that's that's a factor too yeah absolutely right so I'm not saying this is this all always the case but I think this is where there's like some amount of of like you gotta really think a little bit about so if like a girl like confessed her love for you how would you respond I mean if I'm interested in her then you know why why do I need to wait I guess okay so so how long does it take you to figure out if you're interested in her I don't know 24 hours okay I could be wrong because I never I was never in that sort of situation before right so I I I think it may take you a little bit more than 24 hours yeah I I guess right and even if it doesn't like so that there's I don't even know how true this is but it's something that I remember hearing it's not like scientifically valid or maybe it is I have no idea but that men fall in and out of love quicker but like women take longer to fall in love but stay in love longer so so I think I think something that you just got to acknowledge is that sometimes like people need time to process and I certainly would not block them just because you're feeling uncertain do you see that like you're you're using blocking them as an antidote to your own emotional discomfort yeah yeah and then it sounds like it really hurts you when you know that they've been using Instagram they're using the internet they saw your message and [ __ ] a they're not responding to you and how does that feel oh damn horrible absolutely what is the emotion that you're feeling there well um in in that instance unlovable basically in that instance and and what so I'm gonna I'm gonna give it another word it's ignored you're being ignored yeah and when you're being ignored what are you gonna do you know all sort of things just not to feel it absolutely but you sure as hell ain't gonna put up with that [ __ ] yeah right yeah and if you ain't gonna put up with that [ __ ] what are you gonna do well yeah you're gonna block them and you're gonna swipe right on a ton of other people yeah yeah right yeah that's true and so flow like I think I think you're I think you're a wonderful person I think you've worked really hard at like growing over the last it sounds like two years I think you're more lovable than you give yourself credit for which I think you do sometimes give yourself the appropriate amount of credit but that inside of the the Chad flow is a little like beta flow and sometimes right yeah and and sometimes if you get treated a particular way you get terrified that the Chad flow is not the real flow and the real flow is the beta flow and oh my God it's happening again yeah and then to avoid that because you hate feeling like beta flow you're blocking them and the second you block them the second you ghost them you don't have to feel like betaflow anymore you can swipe right on on 10 women they're gonna text you and you're back to being Chad flow yeah but neither the Chad flow nor the beta flow or the true flow they're both false aspects of you which you'll meditate for a while and you'll understand that mm-hmm does that make sense yeah yeah it makes a lot of sense because I was just thinking about one of your meditation guys that you talk about this yeah like the aspect of told there's no toll without short there's no show without or something like that yep and and so so I'll leave you with one last thing the true Chad does not fear being the beta yeah so it's it's like okay give people a little bit of time more practically like give women some time or whoever you're dating give them some time to process if you change the rules of the game yeah yeah I'm writing that down as as we speak this this and and like practically if you've got those friends if you're feeling that way maybe talk it through with a friend instead of like engaging in a behavior with the person that you're dating does that make sense yeah oh yeah yeah it makes sense it makes sense I'm really excited for you Flo I I think you're you're a wonderful Dude and and I I really hope you find love thank you but you have to give it a chance yeah any last thoughts or questions well nothing much it's just I'm a really big fan of your work like like this is the one I want to say it really helps me a lot good last two years that's what we're here for and and thank you for calling in because I think with you calling in you're gonna help a lot of other people so thanks for being a part of the process thank you thank you for having me welcome my friend yep thank you what do you go by uh just go by social that's fine soche fussy okay Sochi no no uh let's try torstein torslane yeah yeah okay it's uh yeah it's not the easiest name I guess ah I mean no I'm sure it's easy if you speak the language yeah yeah I mean I mean for uh uh non-speakers sure Horse Lane um what what are your online dating experience tell us about your experience with online dating I have been um they've been limited and I've just started uh a couple of months ago okay yeah uh they've mostly just been uh not so great uh got a couple of matches but they they were some of them just advertising um uh Services you know no I don't I've never what kind of services uh sexual return for payments okay that was a that was a bit of a bit of a shock but okay okay um let's see they're those are like two yeah two or three who did that okay there was another one I mentioned wait wait when that happens do you like report the person or what no I just like um no not interested uh good luck okay because I I don't think it's illegal here to do that I mean I'm in Norway okay and I don't think uh doing it yourself is illegal I think it's only illegal if someone else is profiting from it oh okay no but I mean in terms of like a I mean a dating app is it oh yeah you mean like that yeah yeah yeah not like legally I mean like I'm just curious like what happens when someone on a dating app tries to sell you something uh I don't know okay I haven't met that part of the terms and conditions that well no thanks not interested bye okay yeah so it sounds like you've been dating using dating apps for a couple months so what's it been like yeah um it was just been like that there were a couple of other matches and we're all right we started fine now not chatting with the chats then they went on to um uh let's see yeah there was one she has this really nice question early on uh so what do you do for a living which is nice it's a normal question so I tell her and then the next question was a bit worse I was like oh is that poorly paid which I thought was yeah I thought that was a bit of a strange question so early basically asking how much do you make okay you know so I was like uh yeah I told her that was a weird question and then she said just unmatched okay so that was that was that and yeah how do you understand that I basically take it that she was looking for uh well a richer man okay I would think so I mean so a charitable uh interpretation would be that just making sure that I'm not some unemployed bum but uh I mean since I already have a job that shouldn't have been the main issue okay yeah and other experiences uh there was one yeah one more she was but it turned out quite early that she was pregnant and Pregnant you're not responsible for that I'm assuming no no no no no no that came up quite early in the um chatting as well before this person is pregnant and dating oh I want a dating app anyway yeah so um not really my thing so those are the matches so I've never actually gone on a date as a result of uh dating app okay so so so far just to understand this you've gotten some people trying to sell you sex yeah one person who asked you what you do for a living asks you how much money you make I mean were they making conversation or were they like oh this was uh this was what was third fourth question and when they say like is that well paid like can you just say yes and move on uh oh it's not exactly I mean it's normal paid okay it's like yeah you took issue with like you you sort of got the vibe that she was sniffing around for someone who's wealthy yeah asking that early on was yeah okay and so then then you mentioned you responded to her and you said hey I think that question's inappropriate and then she unmatched yeah yeah as a not inappropriate that's a bit of a weird question I said and did you answer it or no no it didn't answer it just like just answered with saying hey that's a bit of a weird question isn't it and then they just unmatched yeah yeah and then the third person is looking to date and is pregnant yeah and so that that's not your thing you said that's no no not really that's that's definitely gonna come with complications uh yeah yeah and and so did you just tell her yeah I'm not interested or or what yeah yeah that's just what is it I'm uh that's not something I want to get into sorry uh but you know best of luck it sounds like it was nice that she told you she was pregnant yeah yeah yeah that was that would have been a shocker otherwise yep but but it so it sounds like she was pretty open about that and pretty respectful and and not like leading you on and stuff so it's kind of a win right yeah absolutely but it's still like you know yeah and so when in that sense but yeah yeah so if these have been your experiences with online dating what are you thinking going forward like is this you but you said you want me to this a couple months right yeah I mean I've well I've been single now for for 10 years okay and then yeah after that breakup well I did Count a couple of dates but then yeah I've been just staying away from the whole thing for a while after yeah for a few years okay I've just not been doing anything romantic and and now I figure yeah it's time to to get back into it okay well I'm sorry you've had such a a rush you know reintroduction ah yeah yeah that's uh I mean I wasn't going into the apps with biggest of hopes and and which apps are you using uh well there's this one called um happen which uh well it just sort of lets you know when other people who are using it are in your vicinity okay now if you walk past them on the uh on the street or whatever okay and then you can see how often you've crossed paths with them in the last week or whatever okay so that's yeah that that's the app you're using yeah is that the is that like a common one in Norway uh I think so I didn't do any research I just saw Googled dating apps and this one looked nice okay and then there's one yeah I'm also using one called bumble and how's that going uh that's where I'm at the pregnant woman but yeah otherwise that's nothing much happening there so I think if I'm gonna let it work I should get better pictures and uh write a better bio yeah and and how how much what is your what was your process of setting up your profile um I had a couple of pictures around now were fairly recent and I used them and then I just took one one of those selfies to have the most recent one and then just yeah there's some questions to ask the some questions you answer like what are you looking for a relationship nothing serious blah blah okay height and weight yeah okay and then you write something about yourself so so it sounds like you need to or you didn't really spend too much effort on your profile or pictures no no not yet and is that something that you're thinking about doing yeah yeah I think you have to ask some some friends to help me out with it sounds good man it sounds like you just had some weird experiences so far it started off funny so it can really only go up well let's hope I wouldn't temp fate if I were you no that's porcelain you can try storage state thought thorsted yeah that's uh yeah cool I don't know what else to say because I think usually people have had a little you know have been on dating apps for a little while longer I really like appreciated your stories yeah I'm happy to to hear more about it if you want to share but you know it sounds like you've only been on the app apps for a couple months I've only had a couple of experiences yeah this is pretty much it cool um oh yeah I'm looking at the thing I wrote I remember this last one but that's such a small story she just wanted to get on some some chatting apps she was using not messenger some not messenger not WhatsApp from third or fourth one and I was like ah what is that app I don't know and then she said okay bye so yeah why do they ask you to move to a different app to chat I didn't know I asked like why and she was like uh uh she deleted the contact afterwards so I can't look over it exactly what you said but it all looked sort of weird so it sounds like people unmatched pretty easily sounds like well I mean I yeah hmm okay yeah I mean I I don't know it just sounds like you know any kind of anything that doesn't follow the script results in unmatching uh yeah it looks like it okay yeah so Chad is also saying that maybe that was a scam what do you think entirely possible for some weird other app but yeah that's entirely possible I mean at least I was suspicious of it sure and and maybe since the scammer since you didn't download it right away any chance it was like a catfishing profile uh catfishing yeah like was it like a fake profile or was it could it did it look more real it could have been real okay the pictures all look like normal pictures and not I mean you see some of those yeah I really have obviously just some taking off a model page and it's like yeah those are all professional pictures no that's not real but this one yeah this one looked normal I think yeah anything else you want to share any questions that you've got because I I just don't have much to ask given you know what your initial experience has been pretty limited so uh well no no not really well I I'd love to you know if you could keep us updated either if we do this again or um you know posting on Reddit or whatever like I'd love to hear what your experiences are like a few months out a few more months in are you like optimistic or how are you kind of feeling about it I'm somewhat optimistic but I'm not overly invested I mean I also just meet people out in the world okay so so let me there so yeah there's a bunch of things that can happen cool so it sounds like you're just on the early stages and kind of exploring and and not overly investing but also it's just sort of like seeing what's gonna happen yeah yeah yeah and I'd I'd love to you know if there's some way that you can let us know if we do this again like just you know maybe give us an update a few months from now I'll see if if I'll remember it a few months from now all right man take care yeah YouTube cheers bye foreign
