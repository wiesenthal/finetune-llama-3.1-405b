but this is the kind of thing where like if you all are having trouble so this is just general advice right so people are like sort of doing this weird like no one's really saying it but you kind of get disinvited and people are awkward and stuff like that i think it's important to have a conversation with people and say you know these friendships are really important to me i want to understand what to expect i understand that i screwed up i understand that i was manipulated and if if you all sort of feel like because of that you know there is like i'm always going to be kind of a second class citizen in this friend group like that's fine i just want to know is that what i should expect hello hello thank you so much for having me uh my name is dylan hi dylan uh let me just scroll up quickly to find my question again um yeah so my question uh last year i had a huge falling out with a friend of mine and she tried contacting me and i didn't answer back then and recently i felt ready to send her a message myself so i did and she hasn't opened it yet and it will probably stay that way and this has made me feel like i lost a huge part like a huge friend in my life so how should i go about this loss and how can i prevent such things uh from happening in the future i'm sorry that happened um do you want to go first you go okay um yeah i'm i'm really sorry that happened i i think i think this is one of those like even the best case scenario is not like you will have that friendship back at 100 so it's kind of like once these friendships fall apart like there is no 100 anymore so [Music] i i think like kind of mourning that relationship is appropriate where like this person isn't going to be in your life in the same way anymore but if it's more of a question of like how to avoid this in the future i think that's really about the dynamic of how it happened in the first place so i would want to ask you more questions about kind of what happened to be able to give you better advice about how to avoid it what uh sure so you want me to give more context about it more context to like know what to say but do you have any initial thoughts before he gives context um yeah so i i didn't mean to laugh i realized i could have come across as callous because like i just hear this story so damn much and and i do i do think there's actually like a super simple answer to it and but if we want to go into the context like so we can sort of answer the question given everything that you've asked which is going to give you a general answer about how to behave uh which i i think is pretty straightforward but if we want to kind of dive into it or maybe i can say my piece and then i can get more content you can give the general advice so first thing to understand so like let's let's understand timeline so how what was the distance what was the time frame between the falling out you had and when your friend sent you a former friend sent you a message like basically instantly okay and what was the time frame between you not responding to that message and you sending them a message a year okay and how long have you waited for a response um about two to three weeks okay so let's just understand the situation your response time to your friend is how long uh a year okay so like and you're expecting a response in how long uh i'm like not even really expecting a response i like realized that like she could be doing the exact same like thing to me 100 right so so and i don't think that's out of malice i don't think she's like screw you you're messaging me after a year i mean there may be some kind of resentment but let's just acknowledge for a moment that it takes time for human beings to process feelings and in your case it took you a year which is like totally fine and so give your friend some leeway and don't give up on the relationship yet because i think you know it may be salvageable so i just give your friend like it's been two weeks and it took you a year so like cut your friend some slack and be a little bit patient the other general advice sorry uh you you can be compassionate the other general advice is is that when someone sends you a message it's something that everyone needs to understand when someone sends you a message you should at least respond in some way that is like respectful and lets them know you're considering it this whole like leaving thing leaving things on red is just so painful for people so if your question was how do i prevent this from happening again what i would strongly strongly recommend is that if they send you a message right away you at least respond to them and you say hey like the falling out that we went through has been really hard on me like i'm gonna need some time to process least let them know that you you know because like imagine what that experience is like for your friend where y'all are close friends you have a falling out they sort of extend some kind of hand and i'm not saying you have to patch things up i'm not saying that you have to like you know have a deep conversation with them but at least some kind of receipt of acknowledgement and letting them know that you need some space to process i think would really if you're trying to figure out how do i prevent this from happening again that one message i think could impact a lot what do you think about that yeah yeah uh so to give a bit more context you said that you like heard the story a lot before so you're probably like can like already guess that i like kinda had a crush on this girl um so uh that also like made me um like a lot like clingy and jealous and like very controlling over her which he also didn't like which was like one of the major points of the reason of uh that that like the falling out and um yeah so basically like i wanted to respond when she sent a message and i'm like gonna do like a confession here for like 4k people but like i kind of did that in a manipulative way like i wanted her to worry about me i guess well not i guess i know muted so i was just saying i i think grooty go saying we were commending your self-awareness yeah and i was saying like that you know i think it's a really big step you've taken and if you want to prevent these kinds of things happening again you know as we say good diagnosis precedes good treatment even though nothing here is medical treatment i think it's a good you know general thing that you have to understand a problem before you can fix it and you're being able to admit some of your feelings and your awareness of how you are feeling i think will is the first step is the antidote to like those kinds of manipulative behaviors because once you acknowledge the way that you feel they lose their ability to control you as powerfully all right are you still crushing on her uh no i've moved on from that sag sorry all fell apart but yeah that that's it seems like you know kind of what happened and so you would be able to not do that again and for what it's worth i wouldn't give up on the relationship quite yet and i would even say you know given a a little bit of space i don't think it's i don't think it's a huge problem to even send another message like one more message maybe in a couple of months if you really feel like you need to for the sake of your closure and then let it go yeah it's it's also a bit difficult because we share a friend group and like with the remainder of those friends i i still like i'm still on good terms with um but like oftentimes when we're hanging out and she wants to join i like have to go away um why wait do your friends know what happened between the two of you they do okay uh well yeah i and and to answer the question of why um wait go ahead i'm trying to toggle the mutes and stuff too um so you're trying to figure out a way to both be in the same place together well yeah because like i basically i wanna like hang out with my friends and it's it's kind of hard then to uh to do that when i get a well sent away often like i understand why i get sent away it's it's because like it gets awkward and she doesn't want to be in the same room as me and i've been kind of like you know like a a villain or like a negative person towards her so well i mean um it's basically like the majority like vote like they're basically like yeah i don't i don't really want him here and the other person says uh well yeah i also think it's gonna get awkward i i believe that you should like go away basically got it yeah so that's where i mean something about what you're saying really pisses me off yeah um so we don't know the details of how much of a manipulative person you were so maybe that's but a year is a long time yeah i mean i i would jail sentence i feel like your time is served so here here's where here's where like so we we have potentially a failing in this community which is that we tend to accept people and root for them no matter how bad they've screwed up right so so that's where like i think it's important for you to take responsibility for your behavior and i think it's important for you to have a conversation with your friend group about what it sounds to me like unfair treatment so like you know you can say i would ask your friends like what does this mean for us going forward does this mean that y'all are gonna essentially like send me away anytime she wants to hang out for with with you does this mean that like essentially could i interrupt yeah because i i feel like i haven't given like quite a neutral stance because to give like more nuance to be like more specific um it was like four so our friend could consist of four people including me so still four people so um it was for a party um that she and one other person hosted and the other person like invited me to that party i was welcomed there and um but then like the the other day uh she said like the the girl that i fell out with um said that i don't really really want him there at our party so it's like a 50 50 percent like leadership yeah um about that party yeah so and and then like basically like i already had that 50 that didn't want me there and then the other friend that i was on good terms with said that yeah i kind of like understand her and like she didn't say that she was picking sides but it definitely felt that way that she was like basically picking sides and i mean i understand like like it's like a girl's big girl side thing and also like i've been like the bad person in that story um so i i understand why i got sent away from there but like the other friend that i didn't talk about in that story like he was like pretty neutral about it like he he definitely felt bad about uh so i mean i think those details are important but also the broader issue still stands that i think a lot of times in friend groups crappy behavior gets propagated because it isn't explicitly named right behavior we're talking about my behavior we're talking about your friend's behavior now so so i i think that if you've screwed up and you were an ass like so this is where i think that you should have a conversation with your friends about your behavior how you were out of line how you were you've apologized and then essentially ask your friends to lay out what you should expect so i think a very very very good way to navigate relationships is to ask people what your expectations should be about their behavior because when you do this i know this could torpedo your friend group but just let's just talk through it okay so this is why i sort of mentioned that i kind of feel pissed off because i feel like kind of combative i feel like you know so maybe don't listen to me thanks for that facial expression it really helps keep me in check but this is the kind of thing where like if you all are having trouble so this is just general advice right so people are like sort of doing this weird like no one's really saying it but you kind of get disinvited and people are awkward and stuff like that i think it's important to have a conversation with people and say you know these friendships are really important to me i want to understand what to expect i understand that i screwed up i understand that i was manipulated and if y'all sort of feel like because of that you know there is like i'm always going to be kind of a second-class citizen in this friend group like that's fine i just want to know is that what i should expect or is this the kind of thing where my ability to spend time with y'all always depends on the comfort of a third person who i kind of like already got to expect that this situation only happened one time and i don't know if it's by pure coincidence or by i don't know like uh chatting and meeting up behind my back that like i never um like besides that situation from the party i never got into another situation where we would we both me and the girl who would have um yeah so that doesn't that doesn't sound nearly as bad to me because i think it's a whole different story when someone is a host and doesn't want you invited right so like if i'm a host i get to choose who i invite i have questions yeah how old are you 20 years old 20. okay so this was you've already done like a year of penance with this friend group right uh penance as in sorry i'm not a native english speaker oh sorry so like you've already kind of paid the price you've been punished for a year uh well yeah by punishing that means like not really getting the chance to hang out with the friend group as much and like also not having the chance to hang out with that specific friend as much okay and so you're 20 are you at university yeah okay um and also like this this was my like only real friend group at university yeah so it sounds like to me you're trying to like hold on to these people because these are your only friends so far right or only like good friends so far um okay so i think i think 20 is a good age to kind of go through this um i think don't you're in this situation because you were manipulative and jealous right so i feel like if you follow what olo is saying it's just going to play into a reputation of being manipulative so i would not recommend that okay she's probably right here yeah because like when you have those conversations you have to deliver it like you have to say the lines the way all oak says them if you say those lines in a way that a normal person says the lines like hey i just want to know what to expect from this friend group like it's not gonna land in the same way um so i would not recommend that um the the thing is you made these friends probably you're halfway through university yeah about that okay so i think now is the right time to start branching out and trying to keep the relationships you have here one-on-one friendships in a way that lets you hold on to the people that you want to hold on to lets the people that need some distance and like frankly aren't mature enough to navigate like the complexities of having to like pick a side and i think now is the time to kind of spread your wings um i know that's so much easier said than done but to me these are like learning moments really like what have we learned um yeah absolutely so what you're saying is find new friends or am i understanding it wrong i i'm saying two things i made an and sign because i feel like when alec and i talk things get confusing i'm saying two things um i'm saying one make new friends and i'm saying to keep out of these four keep the friends that are important to you in a one-on-one setting because i don't think it's too hard to have built these relationships and just flush them down toilet so i don't think you should do that i think you should hold on to those friends and also find new friends yeah i feel like it's it's been a bit like i'm doing the latter thing that you said about like the keeping the one-on-one friendships i'm doing that but the first thing like making new friends i feel i felt that like since the falling out i haven't really been able to get as deep of a friendship or like get as close to people as i've been like really i've met new people but i like it's very superficial sorry all oak is controlling the mutes and it's very difficult um my question was if um these people that you're seeing that are superficial friendships are like people you're just seeing in passing at the university or if you're like socializing with them outside of that yeah the the people that i've been seeing are at the university and it's basically just like it's to have friends basically it's just so i'm not like hanging around alone because like the first uh semester of this year i was basically hanging around all alone because i didn't have a friend group and then in the second semester i like kind of like got my drift like uh like i i got back on track um so and and i met like some new people just at university but it's just yeah as i said to just have friends basically it's not really like oh i really want a deep connection it's just so i have so i'm not alone 100 understand i think loneliness and isolation is one of like if it's not the number one it's in the top three things that college students struggle with i think it's loneliness and nice loneliness and isolation is i think number one number two is like a fear of judgment um and i think the third is like stress management so the first thing i want you to know is like you're not alone a lot of people feel this way and a lot of people are also trying to make meaningful friendships in the same situation um i think that the how did you make these friends in the first place um well first of all it's just the university side that's that's a bit of a problem i do have friends like outside of university i still have friends from from middle school in high school so it's not necessarily that i'm that i really feel alone it's it's just at university the union university side is a bit but the the way that i made these friends is like my pure coincidence really so um like i i joined some um like activities that's for like the first years um like we get to know each other and all that um and i met like one guy through that and then that guy knew someone else um and that was basically the friend group so i i think just for the record dylan i think grooty's advice is way better than mine for this one so i would definitely listen to her because i think if you do what i said you're gonna drive your friends away because they're not gonna be able to tolerate it and i think that at some point you've got a you know you've got a sometimes there are situations you're 20 so maybe not yet there are situations in which you've got to channel your inner chad thunder [ __ ] right you they're they're talking about here huh uh what are we uh i'm i'm not entirely sure what are we talking about here so so here's here's what i'd say if you want if you want a softer way to talk to your friends what you can sort of share with them is say hey you know i really miss being able to hang out together it's been really awesome that we've been able to maintain one-on-one relationships um i really value your friendship and i hope that we'll all be able to hang out together again you can say something like that that's a lot more manageable and i would also say that at some point if your friends are treating you like a second class citizen that you shouldn't put up with that like there's a certain amount of like you screwed up so you know like you should pay for that punishment but at some point like if you're always if you're invested in this friend group and you care about these people and they're sure you're the guilty party that that's where like understanding a little bit about like what can you expect from this relationship like 10 years from now is one of them gonna get married because you all have been friends for 10 years and you're not going to get invited to the wedding because this person is invited to the wedding right so there's a part of me that still is pissed off about the situation that you're in and i feel like you're being treated unfairly up to a point and i'm not saying that you should lean into that now because at 20 years old no one knows how to handle authentic like conflict in relationships so don't do what i said and at the same time like over time you don't want to you don't want to hang out with people who are going to perpetually who for whom forgiveness and a repair of a relationship is like not in the cards right you want to form friendships with people who despite your mistakes will be able to patch things up and if the friend group that you have if you screw up once if you're in the doghouse for the rest of your life or if you get punished for the rest of your life if you get treated like a second-class citizen for the rest of your life that's not a friend group that i would want for you i agree the the only um last thing that i want to kind of say to you is about awkwardness and awkwardness is something you can push through like it's gonna be awkward for one two three four parties after that it's just the way it is so i do think standing up for yourself in this situation is the right thing to do because i think that if these people are not going to be your friends anymore this is kind of like the way you're going to know whether or not it's worth salvaging those one-on-one relationships or the group relationship if if you do say like hey look i screwed up i really would like for us all to be friends if we can do that that would make me really happy and if we can't do that then like i just kind of need to know so i can move on if i need to move on and i think that is a fine thing to do what you need to know is that if that is the approach that you take there's a possibility that people will say yes it's time to move on so if you want to force that conversation you have to know that like you can kind of go one of two ways so that's why i'm kind of that's kind of like up to you on whether like how strongly this is kind of bothering you but i think um i think force like i wouldn't let the awkwardness win her her i would listen to her for sure yeah i've like sorta like already sort of like had this conversation i mean it's not really hard to have this like conversation with them because there's only like two people there so they basically like know everything that that happened but i'm mostly worried about like what because like now i'm having all these like superficial friendships and not real different ships i'm i'm mostly worried about that yeah so that's part of the reason that i was sort of saying like have an earnest conversation so i think one thing that it's kind of hard to do as human beings is like if we're holding space in our heart for lack of a better term for a certain group of people sometimes there is not space for other people and so we normally think about this in a romantic term in a romantic sense right so if i'm like still in love with my ex from 10 years ago and i never really got over her it's going to be hard for me to participate in a healthy relationship the thing is i think we see that for we see that for all kinds of other relationships so we we see that for friendships we see that for marriages and like step children right if there's no space in my heart for my step kids like that's not going to be a healthy relationship and so if you're sort of emotionally invested in these friends it may actually make it a little bit harder for you to make space for other people but i do think one of the things that you say about friendship that i i strongly believe in is like a routine so like if a couple of you always go for coffee after this class or you um have like tuesday evenings you play tennis with this person or like some sort of regularity that's where i think you get the most opportunity to develop a deeper relationship when you have regular interactions outside of your kind of day-to-day activities yeah so i would try to organize something like that yeah that's been kind of like happening with like the one remaining event that i still have from that friend group but like i'm i'm pretty much hearing that if i like want to make deeper connections again it's like a situation of just move on can i hear that correctly no it's take what's good about this friend group keep that close to you and also don't be limited to just these four people because also it's just for people yeah yeah i mean yeah that's true like when i've been talking about this right now i feel like i mean it's just for people like that it sounds kind of like harsh but there's always like new people not really replacements but like still there's new people yeah cool good luck to you bro all right yeah thanks so much for the advice guys goodbye you
