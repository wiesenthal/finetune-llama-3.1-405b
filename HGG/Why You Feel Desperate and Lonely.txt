you're starving so bad that you don't have space to share right so you're starving and then you get a sandwich and you're so starving that all you can think about is eating that sandwich and it feels so good to finally get some food that in that process of you getting your own needs met you don't have space for another person in that relationship dr k should address the men desperately looking for partners hello and welcome to my controversial post i feel i poorly expressed my post point here's my updated post i've seen so many posts from my fellow men expressing how they feel about being alone i fully admit i myself have done it and even tired of seeing the same basic premise i for one can't imagine how the female members feel but i imagine they feel objected and annoyed i'm aware this is a contentious topic is a dude who is single and lonely in a new job new city and knew everything i get it however mostly posts the same stuff most posts say the same stuff i'm horny alone no woman will ever be able will love me because i'm ugly i don't talk to women and none like me i don't go out and talk to women and i'm angry about that i just want a girlfriend for sex or for intimacy which isn't really healthy the reasons are inherently bad and really won't get you to your goal many of my fellow men wallow in loneliness and feel sex and romantic intimacy will get them what they want and it may for a time however if you don't love you if you aren't okay with you if you're not the person you want to love then you'll likely have issues with the relationship i'm no expert but i i am a guy and i can tell you that while being horny alone sucks being in a toxic relationship is worse than hell work on yourself bros focus on you but most importantly put yourself out there and remember that rejection is rejection to the guys who are emotionally abused valid and don't know how to talk to women i was cheated on valid and i don't feel comfortable with women these guys need help and time don't jump into dating take time to focus on you and that's the core of it you need to focus on you no matter who you are if you come off as desperate depressed angry and or women are just reproductive organs then you'll literal you'll likely keep incurring the same problem while i sympathize with you guys we need to focus on us and not make sex in a relationship the goal here's my original post i as a man i'm tired of seeing my fellow lonely men cry about being alone i fully admit i myself have done it and even tired of it i i for one can't imagine how the female members feel why am i tired of it because they say the same stuff i'm horny alone no women will be able to love me because i'm ugly i know talk to women and unlike me i was emotionally abused valid and don't know how to talk to women i was cheated on valid and i don't feel comfortable with women the first half where the guys in essence horny alone is so overdone i'm sorry guys but holy moly if you want to meet women you need a social life and if that's all your goal is then your desperation will precede you no one likes desperate so many of my fellow men wallow in loneliness and feel sex and romantic intimacy will get them what they want and it may be for a time however if you don't love you if you aren't okay with you if you're not the person you want to love then you'll likely have issues with the relationship i'm no expert but i i am a guy and i can tell you that while being horny and alone sucks being in toxic relationship is worse than hell work on yourself bros focus on you but most importantly put yourself out there and remember that rejection is rejection mods updated for clarity of opinions mods feel free to delete this if it's too toxic okay so this is a fantastic post first of all because i think we're learning as a community right so i think this post comes across is more invalidating harsher this post i think is a little bit more nuanced in depth which is wonderful and so i do want to talk to you all today a little bit about this issue and what i'm sort of talking about is that there are a lot of posts out there there are a lot of people out there who feel lonely and desperate they want love you know or they want sex or they want all of the above they want intimacy and they feel incredibly sometimes they feel incredibly frustrated they feel like the world is an unfair place they feel like you know they're they've been dealt a crappy hand of cards which essentially dooms them to loneliness they feel desperate and sometimes when we feel desperate and we don't get something that we want we really want to blame the whole world for our situation which isn't necessarily wrong right so like let's just acknowledge for a moment that a lot of things about our life are not determined by us like the fact that i am not the son of a billionaire or that you know i had abuse of parents or like all these things are karma they're not determined by us so the truth of the matter is that sometimes things like not everything that we do is our fault not all of our circumstances are our fault in fact most of our circumstances aren't our fault there's also are there all kinds of other like karmic things which can make relationships easy for you so for example did you grow up with an intact household did you learn from your parents how to navigate conflict did you learn from your parents how to express feelings did you learn from your parents how to respect boundaries did you learn from your parents how to lay boundaries so some of us who grew up with with you know good households loving households learn a lot of this stuff intrinsically and it kind of gets baked in at a very young age there's also a lot of stuff about self-worth here because if you don't feel good about yourself and you're desperate and hungry and and horny and alone and you want intimacy people sort of believe that the desperation carries through and since i'm ugly and i'm desperate i'm screwed no one will ever love me and those feelings are like completely valid even some of the points that they make are completely valid now a lot of times what will happen is at some point like in this discussion people will start talking about society right they'll say like society is this society is that i've made that mistake before so let me just start by sort of saying the way we're gonna address this today is not by talking about society it's not about like what society does for us or doesn't do for us these are all valid and important discussions i'm not saying they aren't so for example you know the role of masculinity is rapidly changing men face particular problems women face particular problems non-binary people face particular problems i'm not trying to invalidate any of those perspectives at the same time when i see these kinds of issues what i hear is you're desperate you're lonely sure you had a rough life and the desperation will precede you and you have to focus on yourself you have to learn to love yourself you have to be happy with yourself to enter into a healthy relationship we hear all these truisms does anyone tell us how does anyone say here is how you love yourself here are the steps so here's what i find is the biggest problem that men in the situation run into is that i find that there it's very difficult for them to think about someone else's needs okay so there are a lot of lonely and desperate men in this situation and you can sort of say like work on yourself first and then you can sort of enter into a relationship but the truth of the matter is that like this is not easy to do so we have this concept right of like bringing yourself up by your bootstraps and we kind of think about this in the financial sense that like you can be a self-made millionaire but the truth of the matter is that like it's very it's way easier to have good financial circumstances at the get-go when you launch on your financial journey that leads to a lot more success than pulling yourself up by the nature of your own you know strength and guts and all that kind of stuff and the interesting thing is that this is true from an emotional and relationship standpoint as well like self-worth is oftentimes given to you which is weird because it's sort of self-worth right but if we think about kids who grow up confident and love like they have a huge advantage so if you're someone who's lonely and desperate people say work on yourself first but like working on yourself i know it's kind of weird but is rarely a solo pursuit so this is the first thing is we can say work on yourself and we will teach you how to work on yourself so don't worry about that but let's just acknowledge how hard it is to work on yourself and this doesn't apply to men only by the way right so this is like sure there are a lot of men who face the situation but it's like if you're someone who is desperate for connection feeling lonely feeling horny craving intimacy and that desperation precedes you you come across as clingy you come across as pathetic you come across as desperate you tend to drive people away that's a really hard thing to overcome because like let's just think a little bit about how does that person overcome that sure you can do this mythical internal work you can go to india and stay at an ashram for tons and tons of months and years and and study to become a monk but the truth is even in my own life like i had a woman who accepted me and you know far before i accepted myself so the truth of the matter is that human beings are community creatures we're community organisms we're not like most human growth just historically does not happen in a cabin in the woods right human growth and human connection and like becoming who you are happens with mentorship happens with like you know hopefully parental love you you know your bros who are there for you siblings who are there for you your girls who are there for you it comes from other people even studies of of borderline personality disorder and narcissistic personality disorder clearly demonstrate the value of social connection and we know that social capital there have been tons of study about the positive impacts of social capital on mental health so being a part of community that cares about you is huge for your own sense of identity and so how do we navigate this because like the truth is that like unfortunately it's very hard to just learn how to love yourself just all on your own so you can it can be done but i think if we really look at the way that the majority of people learn how to respect themselves it actually comes with some interaction from other people so how do we tackle this problem the first thing that we have to be super careful about is misdiagnosis okay so i don't mean this in a clinical sense but i mean that oftentimes when human beings come up with when they face a problem their mind generates an answer but the mind isn't really like critical about it right so if you think about why am i alone your mind will say oh because i'm ugly or because i'm desperate and i just reek desperation from my pores but if we really think about you know let's say you've had a set of relationships you've gone on dates and things like that the reason that you're alone isn't just what you think in your head actually the the best sources of information are going to be the people that you date right the tricky thing is that oftentimes we don't really respect boundaries we don't have good ways of collecting feedback we don't know how to interact with those people so we don't really know why they choose not to date us again and then we formulate our own conclusions but what are those conclusions based on they're based on our own biases it must be because i'm ugly it must be because i'm desperate whereas in my experience the biggest thing that lonely men tend to miss and it's once again it's not just men is that they they feel desperate and so they think that that desperation comes through but oftentimes it becomes about your own needs so it's not the fact that you're desperate it's that you have such you're starving so bad that you don't have space to share right so you're starving and then you get a sandwich and you're so starving that all you can think about is eating that sandwich and it feels so good to finally get some food that in that process of you getting your own needs met you don't have space for another person in that relationship so when you're starving and you get a sandwich it's so hard to tear that sandwich in half or give half of the sandwich to your partner so the first thing that that i tend to notice in these kinds of people is that they there's a focus on the self which is not sort of it's not their fault i don't blame them for having this because this is what tends to happen is like you know the starving person thinks about eating themselves like why are they in that situation it's because they're starving so it's like a natural consequence of being alone of being starved for affection for being starved from intimacy and so then what happens is like when you enter into a relationship there just isn't space for the other person so it's not that they're avoiding you because you're desperate and ugly it's because like there isn't a relationship for them to participate in there's just needs to be met and this is how sometimes women feel objectified because in a sense they are right because like you're busy getting your needs met and once again it's not we're sort of adopting a male to female kind of perspective but can be the other way around too where like when you enter into a relationship with someone who's who's starving there's going to be a period of time where like they don't have the bandwidth to take care of you and the tricky thing is that sometimes even desperate lonely men will be on the other side of the table in an equally toxic way where they enter into relationships where they are the giver the giver the giver the giver the giver because they know they can empathically they know what it's like to be alone and starve for affection the problem is that that's not sustainable so you're the giver the giver the giver the giver the giver and then as you give and you give and you give and you give and you give they start to your partner potentially starts to feel healthier and then something falls apart because this is not a healthy even relationship so either they become dependent on you or they become independent of you in which case the only thing that you have to give is what you give and so this the premise the relationship is lopsided and it can't grow into an equal relationship so it's really tricky it's scary one of the most terrifying things i've ever seen for people who are insecure who take care of other people in relationships the most terrifying thing is that the person that i am taking care of will no longer need my help because what i bring to them is taking care of them and if they no longer need me if they no longer need the care i provide then they no longer need me and in the worst situations this actually turns into sabotage where like i'm afraid you're gonna leave me if you get better and that's where the relationship has to grow right it has to turn into something else otherwise it can't survive so first thing that you've got to be careful about is misdiagnosis be careful about where your mind generates and what's the quality of information have you had a series of long and honest conversations between people who are like comfortable with sharing this information about what challenges they had with you in the relationship because unless you're getting that information from your partner chances are you really have no idea this is where like even after a breakup you may have like a single conversation or people may be emotional i hate you because you did this and you didn't that's not like a real conversation that's just people venting emotionally so first thing is be careful about misdiagnosis the second thing is that if you're in this situation okay how can you work on yourself how can you work on other people how can you make space for other people so today what i'm going to talk to you all about is actually really interesting it's about met the meditation so i think met the meditation or loving kindness meditation is a particular branch of meditation that's designed to develop gratitude and compassion towards yourself and other people and the really fascinating thing about met the meditation we're going to look at a little bit of science and we're going to look at the the the substance of methyl meditation what we'll actually see is that all of the problems that these people suffer from are sort of fixed in a nuanced way through method meditation so the first thing is that when i'm lonely and desperate the only person i'm thinking about is myself that's not really i don't really consider it selfishness so i'm not saying that these people are selfish but it's more just that i'm so preoccupied with myself even in the relationship i'm so preoccupied with myself oh my god am i coming across as desperate oh my god i'm so ugly this isn't selfishness it is focus on the self you can't stop thinking about yourself in these relationships it's not necessarily a good way you're not like oh my god i'm so beautiful but literally there is not space in your cognition for another human being i'm so busy thinking about how ugly i am i'm not paying attention to the fact that the person that i'm dating is blushing when i give them a compliment and clearly feels that i'm out of their league right because they may be feeling that but when i when i feel like i'm an ugly person like beauty is in the eye of the beholder and if i think i'm ugly then that's what i think i'm going to be i'm going to completely ignore the other person's perspective so the first thing that met the meditation does is helps us move outside of ourself and to think about other people the second thing that met the meditation does which we'll talk about in a second is helps us accept that we are not in complete control of things so the other damaging thing about sort of lonely desperate men is that there's a determinism to it right i'm desperate i'm ugly therefore this is fixed and i'm screwed and then in the worst cases what happens is people start to like hate the opposite sex right so it's not necessarily just men because we're sort of seeing this with women too where we can start to like assume all kinds of things about the opposite sex so we need to do is step away from that determinism we need to step away from the fact that like everything is laid out we need to encourage some sense of like a question mark when it comes to the future because when i'm lonely and desperate and the future is hopeless a question mark is a movement in the right direction so we'll see how met the meditation does that the next thing is that there are all kinds of different aspects from a from a scientific perspective so we'll take a quick look at a paper that talk a little bit about these um let me find this right i think so there are all kinds of things that met the meditation has been shown to do and these are the things that i truly believe need to be focused on by this population so if we look at men who have difficulty being empathic difficulty loving themselves difficulty loving other people this is where the attitude of like you know the partners that they end up with feel used right and why is that and it's because like they have sometimes we have difficulty like acknowledging that another person is a person so let's just take a quick look at a paper so this is a study from um let me just page this four okay so this is can compassion meditation contribute to the development of psychotherapists empathy so this is looking at meditation like met the meditation it's a really great review highly recommend it but i'm going to highlight this actually so since very few studies of loving-kindness and self-compassion exclusive focus exclusively on health care professionals let us consider the impact of these meditation practices in the general population so interestingly enough what i'm sharing with y'all is not about psychotherapists or caregivers but it's about the general population so self-compassion has been linked to less anxiety and depression do you think this will help the lonely desperate male i think so greater wisdom and emotional intelligence what are you feeling what drives you emotionally what are your emotional needs that get met do you think this is important for the lonely desperate male i think so as well as feelings of social connectedness and life satisfaction do you think this is important for the lonely desperate male self compassion also fosters the intrinsic motivation to learn and grow it promotes health-related behaviors and it is beneficial for interpersonal relationships does this sound important to the lonely desperate male so in their study examining the link between self-compassion and concern for the well-being of others neph and pommier observed a modest correlation between self-compassion and empathic concern but a more robust negative link between personal distress and self-compassion okay so if we think about the dimensions that for lack of a better term the lonely desperate male needs to improve on depression and anxiety hell yeah social connectedness absolutely you know emotional awareness and wisdom motivation to like grow as a human being absolutely right improve like health for like health-promoting behaviors like absolutely and most importantly removing that negative distress correlation with self-compassion so the way that you feel about yourself so we're gonna flash back to this post for a second so the way that you feel about yourself right so let's go to the unfiltered one i'm horny and alone no women will ever love me because i'm ugly i don't talk to women none like me i was emotionally abused i don't feel comfortable this is all that negative distress which people sort of assume is the desperation that women can sniff they can smell desperation from a while away i don't i in my experience i think that's kind of like a it's an unfair characterization of women because in my experience actually desperation doesn't necessarily cause people to run away it just means that you can't form a healthy relationship with them not because you're desperate but because like a healthy relationship requires two people caring about each other i know tons of people not just women who are compassionate or willing to help desperate people in fact my experience has largely been that when someone is desperate that brings out the best of people in terms of how much we try to help people and support people and i've talked to lots of women who have tried to date men like this and what i usually find is that they try really hard right they'll try to be supportive they'll try to be kind they'll date them for a while but there's just such a thick shell of self-loathing that like you just can't fix that right i'm not saying there aren't bad women out there i'm not saying there aren't bad men out there i'm not saying that desperation brings out the dalai lama out of every human being on the planet but i think that we have to be a little bit careful about the conclusions that we form and i know that there are a lot of people especially in our community who are fixers right who actually like have their best foot forward when it comes to helping another human being they find their dharma they try to help someone you know improve their situation i feel confident about that in terms of our community but what do we see here we see this negative distress and when we have this negative distress what we tend to find is that it reduces our sense of compassion it reduces our empathy towards other people and once self-compassion is gone toxicity comes out once there's a lack of empathy for the other person on the other side of the table that relationship is kind of severely handicapped you
