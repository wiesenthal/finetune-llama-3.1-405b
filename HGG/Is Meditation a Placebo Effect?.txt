you're like okay where do when do i start seeing human beings is fundamentally compassionate when do i start to love myself sure i have like reduced my symptoms of depression i've reduced my symptoms of anxiety but i still don't have this like self-worth that like these meditators seem to have when do i get that all right this is kind of like i personally wanted to talk about this hopefully it'll be helpful it'll be kind of interesting so let's take a quick look at understanding what meditation actually is and how it works so i've been meditating only for several weeks but i see temporary results every time i meditate is this placebo effect my laziness is gone i feel more myself i become more sensitive to sounds i feel more independent so to speak this lasts for probably an hour am i the only one feeling this is this a placebo effect in related i meditated one hour per day for 365 days and here's why i stopped after a year i was thinking about improving my how to improve my character in general um i had nothing in mind that i wanted to change about myself i knew basically nothing about meditation and reckon it was something some sort of superpower of the mind so rather spontaneously i committed to meditate one hour a day for a year the remarkable effects on my life meditation sessions began to be enjoyable beautiful parts of my day the peace of mind and clarity i experienced were priceless in social interactions i felt much calmer all of a sudden i was recognizing consciously so many social cues that give that people give all the time i surely reacted to those cues before i having started meditation but now it became conscious the reason i stopped in some sense my initial motivation of learning meditation as a superpower of the mind was satisfied i got to see how my perception and scope of consciousness expanded however meditation alone will not make you a good person it's not a one time one one type fits all solution and for me personally it felt like i should focus on other things very glad i did this deep dive because now i know the power of this tool and whenever i should need it in my life i can return to daily practice so that's kind of weird right so like how does this work because here's this person who's sort of saying my laziness is gone i feel more like myself this person is saying okay my social interactions are better it's sort of a superpower of the mind so what does meditation do and how does it work because a lot of times the challenge is that you'll read posts like this right you'll see like oh wow like this person was more like calm in social interactions this person like their laziness is gone like that's awesome oh my god you'll also hear people say like oh like i transform like i'm a completely different person after i started meditating meditation has changed my life has revolutionized who i am as a person i gain so much perspective other people will talk about oh meditation like helped me overcome my anxiety so if you're there's kind of scratching your head and you're like how does this meditation stuff work what does this mean like we don't talk about enlightenment right it's like what is it what does that even we stop talking about it like people just stop talking about it at some point but that's like sort of like in the background like i've heard of this thing i know that's sort of what buddha was about but like everyone's like yeah i'm kind of like i'm spiritually buddhist oh like do you know what enlightenment no mindfulness well like no one knows like what the hell is the deal with meditation is it is it a treatment for anxiety is it some way to transform your personality is it a way to get lit rid of laziness for an hour like what what happens like what's the deal here okay so let's try to understand this so the way that i'd explain this is meditation works on three different levels it works on the eight-minute level the eight-week level and the eight-month level and then arguably eight years if you want to go that far okay so the first thing that we know that meditation does is on the eight-minute level so people will say when i meditate i feel good for the duration of the meditation or soon afterward so what effects in the physiology and in neuroscience function on the level of eight minutes so this is where we sort of get autonomic nervous system so meditation will do things like adjust our respiratory rate generally speaking we'll lower our pulse we'll lower our blood pressure generally speaking we'll reduce cortisol and adrenaline and activate the parasympathetic nervous system which is usually what it does for people but it can also activate the sympathetic nervous system which in turn will lead to things like reduced laziness more motivation and this in turn will do things like decrease anxiety decrease insomnia right it'll help us sleep it'll help us chill out so this is physiologic in nature so we know that when we meditate on the order of minutes your physiology will change things like hormone hormone balances will change your sympathetic nervous system parasympathetic nervous system will switch there's also what's confusing for some people some people say it improves my anxiety some people say it improves my laziness how can it do both it kind of wakes me up it kind of calms me down that's the cool thing about meditation it tends to balance your sympathetic and your parasympathetic nervous system now over the course of eight weeks what starts to happen we start to see clinical benefits so what's going on here so eight weeks is where we also start to see neuroscience changes so for example when we reduce our cortisol cortisol is a stress hormone is a stress hormone that acts for about four to 24 hours and it's kind of like a steroidal hormone which means that it alters it travels into our cells and alters gene transcription so it like builds cellular machinery so what that sort of does is it like i don't know how to say this it's not just a temporary effect it constructs the machinery that our cells will use over the next day two days three days so when we meditate on a consistent basis our cells literally start to function in like a different way and as they start to function in a different way we'll start to see neuroplastic changes so over the course of eight weeks we'll see strengthening of the frontal lobes okay so what does this mean our frontal lobes are the breaks of the brain so what they do is they'll like calm down our emotions uh inhibition so they they allow us to like behave less reactively you know when we sort of say like take a step back like i got caught up in this and i wasn't able to take a step back or i was able to take a step back or the frontal lobes also do things like reduce impulsivity and people with adhd we sort of know that people with adhd have poor frontal lobe control on other parts of their brain so people with adhd for example get more emotionally dysregulated more easily and they're unable to control their impulses so we start to see is these that essentially we start becoming let's say like let's just use the example of emotional reactivity so we know that in eight weeks of meditation we can see clinical benefits in anxiety and what does that mean so generally speaking we'll look at like for example gad generalized anxiety disorder so that means that human beings are less impacted by their anxiety so if i have a clinical anxiety disorder my anxiety keeps me from doing things like going to a party or when i go to a party the anxiety becomes so strong that it takes control of me and then i react to the emotion either i rush out the door or i don't go in the first place or i feel overwhelmed or whatever so our emotional reactivity is high in the case of a generalized anxiety disorder and when we meditate this decreases and how does that decrease it's because our frontal lobes are getting stronger inhibiting our emotions okay so what does this mean this means that i can go to parties if i'm less emotionally reactive it also adjusts social things now this is this is the piece where things i think people sort of lose sight of how does meditation transform your life over the course of eight months or eight years how does it cause you to be a different person this stuff we understand really well scientifically now if you behave less emotionally reactively imagine what that does for let's say a romantic relationship so let's say your partner doesn't text you or doesn't respond to your text in 24 hours and you really need their help if you behave if you give in and you have a high amount of emotional reactivity you feel really upset you yell at your partner you're like i can't believe like you were i'm always there for you i always respond to your texts you don't respond to my texts you don't care right so as you as you increase your emotional reactivity it negatively impacts the relationship and then what happens is eventually if the let's assume that the emotional reactivity is so bad you attack them for not responding to you say you don't care about me i'm always there for you you're never there for me this leads to a breakup three months later you're dating someone else romance number two you still have this emotional reactivity they don't respond to your texts within 24 hours you say the same thing i'm there i always answer my texts you know anytime you you need me i'm there for you but when i need you you're not there for me negatively impacts the relationship because you start attacking them because it's not it's not just necessarily your fault right so even if they did they forgot to pick you up at the airport let's say let's say they actually made a mistake that we can all agree on but then what happens is like you react to them so emotionally like what happens when other people attack you you get defensive you attack back you hit back right so emotional reactivity is like not healthy generally speaking in relationships and so as this happens a third time in a fourth time you start all these get put together and then you start to form beliefs so this is where in cbt we talk about core beliefs or schemas right and generally speaking like human beings will have repeated experiences and as we form as we have repeated experiences we start to formulate conclusions about the world and so what this person will conclude is i'm there for people but they are never there for me they'll conclude things like people are untrustworthy they'll conclude these kinds of things then they'll go living their life over the next one year two years three years with this belief as they live with this belief plus the emotional reactivity romantic relationship number five six and seven are screwed because now you're going into the relationship fundamentally believing that people are untrustworthy plus the emotional reactivity oh there it is again i knew it i knew it it almost becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy and this is what happens in people's life right we tend to make the same mistakes over and over again we feel trapped by our circumstances so a good example of this is like i believe that my partner is cheating on me and then i ask them hey are you cheating on me no i check their phone because i don't believe them because people are cheaters as i check their phone i get away with the first time don't get away with it get away with the second time third time fourth time then they find out that i'm snooping damage is the trust and then like eventually like i emotionally drive them away they start connecting to someone else on an emotional level i knew it they're having an emotional affair we break up three months later they're dating that damn i knew that i knew it was true all along becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy and this is what happens in our life right so like people don't make new mistakes every single day we tend to make the same mistakes over and over and over again these are mistakes around self-worth like i'm you know i don't care about myself i don't know how to love myself i have difficulty overcoming my anxiety i procrastinate we tend to make the same mistakes over and over and over again so this shapes our life right on the order of magnitude if we're talking talking about the time this is eight months or even eight years and if you look at people who are like narcissistic for example like this is a classic example of they emotionally react to things as people get upset with them for their emotional reactions what they'll start to do is like form narcissistic belief structures their narcissistic belief structures drive people away and then they form these conclusions like no i can't no one in the in the world loves me like i'm always the victim no one cares about me as a person y'all get that so what does meditation have to do with this let's go back to eight weeks so if i reduce emotional reactivity if i strengthen my frontal lobes right because that's how long it takes to make these kind of neuroscientific changes and specifically we're talking about is the frontal lobe being able to inhibit the amygdala so this is not like a personality change this is literally like being able to take a step back from your emotions and not letting them control you in the matter of minutes so for a five minute time span when your emotions would have taken control you prevent them from taking control and you remain calm and collected what impact does that have on your relationships what impact does that have if you don't lash out hate and you can communicate with people more calmly for relationship number one they didn't answer your text hey by the way i texted you a day ago and like you know i texted you a couple other times and you didn't get back to me like what's going on is everything okay instead of immediately jumping to some kind of emotional hurt which is like this person doesn't care about me what's going on is something going on by the way i know it's kind of like an like a little frustrating thing that i'm working on but i'm like really sensitive to when people don't get back to me on text so like i don't know if you've noticed but i always make it a point to try to respond to your text if you ask me anything and i'm like particularly sensitive to this i'm gonna do my best working on it and thank you for letting me know that you were actually completely stressed out and that like this other crap was going on in your life i had no idea and i understand now why you didn't text me because you approach the conversation calmly you don't react emotionally you foster communication right and so if you do all these things and you listen to them and you like are open-minded they're going to be open minded as well so instead of going on the attack and them sort of becoming defensive you're kind of like looking at things more calmly right you're coming across as more reasonable you guys problem solve together and then what does that change so how does that alter the course of your relationship right so then suddenly no breakup i'm oversimplifying here for a minute but it's like oh wow like people actually like acknowledge that i have needs and stuff like that and they're able to like try to accommodate those and so over time let's say that eventually you do break up and then you enter relationship two and the same thing happens there's conflict you reduce your emotions or your emotional reactivity it's not just reducing the experience of emotions you're not numbing them you're not reacting to them so you're still feeling them you're acknowledging them you're noticing them and you're keeping them in control and then what happens is you communicate but then somewhere along the way if we look at this like you know the beliefs that people are forming uh that you're forming over here as relationship two happens as relationship three happens as relationship four happens the beliefs that you're forming based on these interactions are actually different because as you have these calm interactions with people you can start to like assign different reasons it's not that people are untrustworthy it's that sometimes people want different things right and break up two happens and break up three happens and then you conclude people change so the kinds of beliefs that you start to form once you stop reacting to people emotionally change right so the way that you communicate with this person you don't like stick them in a corner and i don't know if you guys like have friends who will put you in a corner through their behavior like i i don't know if that sort of makes sense but i'm kind of envisioning like there's some people for example in relationship dynamics that will like love to bear their cross and they'll always play the victim and like if you're always like if you have someone in your life who's always playing the victim they kind of force you into being the bad guy and the more that they force you into being the bad guy they keep you in the relationship through guilt but they don't actually build a healthy relationship and then eventually you pull away because you can't deal with that crap anymore and then that person gets their beliefs reinforced oh people like people abandon me and then they drive the next person crazy until they abandon them and they drive the next person crazy until they abandon them and then they like end up with this core belief that like people are always gonna abandon me what they don't realize is that they have a hand in it what they don't realize is that they have control over it and so when you end up with this conclusion that the world is an unwinnable place i'm playing an unwinnable game that's devastating and leads to hopelessness and you lose perspective on life and life sucks and then when you do something as simple as meditate at the eight week mark you can control your emotional reactivity a little bit better as you control your emotional reactivity as you become aware of your internal emotional state and you vocalize that in a way that's calm and not emotionally reactive it alters the dynamic of your relationships as it alters the dynamic of relationships the lessons that you learn from those relationships start to be different this in turn alters your world view alters your core beliefs i am a good person i am lovable if someone leaves me it's not because i'm fundamentally broken people can have all kinds of reasons to leave a relationship with me you all get that and so now we get to the eight-month mark so this too is a neuroscience change because we know that core beliefs and schemas are represented in the brain somewhere right it's not doesn't map onto a perfect circuit but like somewhere in our association courtesies you know like we know that personality is ensconced in the brain and that core beliefs are ensconced in the brain somewhere and so we start to see these kinds of things and then if you do this for eight years then suddenly like you see the world differently like you have hope right because people don't fundamentally abandon you because you're a bad person you don't believe that and so then what it does is alters your outlook on life so then you're not a doomer anymore you're someone who has hope you're someone who's like compassionate and why are you compassionate because you have empathy why do you have empathy because over 10 relationships you've learned how to not be emotionally reactive communicate with the other person in a healthy way and have been able to see like the positive humanity in them right and then you become like a different human being because you just see the world in a completely different way and this is what's so confusing because when people talk about stuff like this like i can say meditation transformed my life i can say that a big part of dr k was born after seven years of meditating and like studying in different oceans in india and then you're kind of sitting there scratching your head because when you meditate for eight minutes and you're seeing this change you're like where the hell is the personality change like and then you do it for a month but you haven't hit the eight week mark and so then you know you haven't seen a clinical benefit like i'm doing this for the sake of anxiety and my anxiety is good for like the 15 minutes that i meditate but after one month i'm not seeing the neuroplasticity that we need for a clinical benefit well yeah that's because that that takes a little bit more time and even if you see the clinical change in your anxiety you'll kind of see this as well we even saw this in this post where this person is kind of like okay i understand the superpower of the mind that was satisfied but this person hasn't made the personality changes yet right like they've seen like the eight month changes but they haven't seen like the lifelong changes because they're not even looking for those they're working on self-development through other ways believe me this person will come back to meditation almost guaranteed and so this is how meditation works and this is what's so confusing for people is because we don't people hear about meditation they hear about these benefits but no one sort of like explains like how the medi benefits of meditation happen in what order they happen and essentially what meditation does is works on three to four different levels the first it works on a physiologic level and calms you down only while you're meditating and so this is why we can say okay take deep breaths if you're panicking like take three deep breaths it works for all human beings because it's physiologic it's like literally the way that our body is built and then people will get that benefit but they're like where's the where's the reduction in anxiety where's the reduction in depression that takes eight weeks and then if you meditate for eight weeks and you start to see those clinical benefits like you're like okay where do when do i start seeing human beings is fundamentally compassionate when do i start to love myself sure i have like reduced my symptoms of depression i've reduced my symptoms of anxiety but i still don't have this like self-worth that like these meditators seem to have when do i get that and then we see something really really important i think this is what's really missed is that when we reduce our emotional reactivity and we start to see clinical benefits that alters our individual interactions with the rest of the world when i get dumped instead of getting resentful i meditate a little bit i calm down a little bit i'm still bummed out but i can acknowledge the sadness without giving into it right so i cultivate that observing self which is able to notice the sadness and still grieve and then still sort of like sit with it and everyone's like how do i sit with it and as you learn how to sit with with sadness it doesn't eat you away from the inside and then like once you do that time and time and time again over the course of eight months a year two years three years and you start to alter the way that you perceive the world it shapes your interactions as it shapes your interactions because you're not emotionally reactive and you're not attacking people all the time then what that does is like shapes your belief in humanity and as your belief in humanity improves your hope improves because now like we don't have to give up on humanity like most human beings are decent people that are struggling and sometimes make mistakes imagine if you believe that in your core of being as opposed to most human beings fundamentally can't be trusted and will abandon me at some point how will that transform your day-to-day interactions the way that you wake up in the morning and what you think about every time you meet a new person is it oh crap not this again or is it wow like look at this person this person is pretty cool and then as you start to live your life with those core beliefs fundamentally changed like then the world sort of gets almost like a positive bias where you acknowledge that some people still struggle and but oh like that that's not it's not personal it's just this person must be having a hard day and then it starts to shape your life in a different direction and as you shape your life in a different direction it actually helps you do things like set boundaries have compassion for your parents who are like bigoted and don't want to accept you and as you start to acknowledge okay wow like this is like you know they're never going to accept me for who i am and that's sad and i can mourn that but i don't have to hate them they're a product of their environment and even though they're a product of their environment like i don't have to let them into my life if they're not willing to give me like what i need this is what i need from that and so you can set about you get a spine right you set boundaries with people and you're able to tolerate their negativity instead of giving in to their negativity and appeasing them and as you do that you start to build healthier relationships and you cut out the negative people in your life because you don't need that crap and you you feel some amount of guilt you acknowledge the guilt so be it adios right and then like your life is different because now you have a different set of peers you have a different relationship your view of a human being is fundamentally different and as you start to act in accordance with that you become one step closer to buddha as you become one step closer to buddha like people respond to you differently you start to attract like different kinds of people right people start treating you with respect and that's pretty cool and so then like that's what happens at the eight year mark it's like your life is completely different and it gets tracked all the way back to your physiology and so that's what confuses people is like you know they look at some people are meditating they're like yeah meditation is obey my life would be completely different and they're like i don't get it because i've been doing this for a month and i can barely get my mind to sit still and it's like that's completely normal don't worry about it this is how meditation changes you this is how it alters your life fundamentally
