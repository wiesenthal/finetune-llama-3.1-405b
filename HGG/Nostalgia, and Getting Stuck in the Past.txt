but the more that you're thinking i wish there was another one the more you're losing sight of the thousand things around you that you can only enjoy in this moment and so once you adopt this kind of mind shift which i'm not saying is easy you have to understand that like look at all of the temporal influences on on your mind and then set all of those temporal influences aside for a moment this is why it's a practice it's a skill and try to enjoy just one thing and then what you'll realize which is like really neat is that your enjoyment of the thing is actually determined by your presence in the moment nostalgia is not as pleasant when you're depressed so for most people nostalgia is generally accepted as being a nice feeling a pleasant memory but for me it just reminds me of a more innocent happier time when i was a child i thought my future was good and all i cared about was playing with friends and climbing trees how things have changed edit i genuinely didn't expect so many kind comments even on a sub like this i feel better and i have you all to thank for that i know exactly how you feel i'd kill to go back to the days of running around the forest in my old old neighborhood with my old friends we've all gone our separate ways some some of us were best friends from the age of three all the way to college and but we have now all gone our separate ways i mean i cherish the memories with my friends and will forever be grateful but nostalgia hurts stay strong friend hear if you need to talk sending good vibes your way so it is interesting right that we tend to think about nostalgia as a good thing right so it's like oh the good old times and when you when you go back in time and you start thinking about the good old times you like smile right you start to think about oh like life was simpler and we also see this like generationally where there's this sort of thing where you know the older people like the older generations and i think this is like pretty common throughout humanity i don't really know i haven't studied it but you know they start to think that the world is going in the wrong direction and the world was like simpler and better when i was young so we sort of had these like rose tinted glasses when we look into the past the challenge is that sometimes when we look into the past it can be like depressing in the present and especially for people who sometimes do feel kind of sad or depressed what they can really do is romanticize the past and it can really become like it can make you feel like you've fallen so far and that you know things have gotten so much worse and like things in the past were so much better and so before we kind of you know so then the kind of question becomes like was the past actually better like is the present actually worse like what's going on here how much of this and especially if we're talking about depression is there some amount of cognitive bias at play and so this is the kind of thing where you can sort of look at these older generations and you can look at things like cognitive bias and you can sort of logically say i don't know if this is correct or not but i'm sure you could make an argument that things in the past weren't weren't better that that's actually just in your head and that the present is just as good as the past and that we have a lot of things to look forward to a lot of things to be hopeful for right so there's sort of that argument which you can make but i think what's really useful is if you're someone who's kind of struggling with nostalgia or if you're someone who is really looking back into your past life and sort of like not not past lives i mean like your past and you're sort of seeing that oh man like things were really were happier for me then than they are now like let's take that sentiment seriously right so instead of dismissing it and saying oh my god it's cognitive bias let's try to take a look at it somewhat seriously and let's try to understand what are the features that lead you to that conclusion and if the past was better can we actually be a little bit scientific and start to wonder okay what about the past made it better because we look at these things like circumstances and stuff like that but i'm not so sure that though that's what actually makes the past better so and the interesting thing is that if we can really start to understand the nature of why the past was better because that's your experience right why the past is better maybe we can try to understand how the present got worse and then the cool thing is that if we're lucky we may be able to figure out a road map to sort of get back to that place so let's kind of take a quick look at this okay and run through you know what's going on with nostalgia so let's kind of recap so the first thing is that for nostalgia some people is for some people nostalgia is pleasant and for some people nostalgia is unpleasant and for the people for whom it's unpleasant there's a sense of change right there's a sense of loss and in the pleasant nostalgia things were simpler now my life is more complicated it's harder right so we'll have these kinds of thoughts and then remember we sort of talked a little bit about the potential of cognitive bias right so what's the level of cognitive bias is this kind of generational channel romanticism is this depressive bias right because when you're depressed your mind is going to be looking at different kinds of things like what's going on here so we can kind of acknowledge that but we have to be super careful because if we sort of dismiss your experience if we say like oh like you're depressed it actually wasn't that great and your life isn't that bad right now that doesn't actually help you so what i'd like to explore today is what are the features that make nostalgia pleasant what's what are the features that make the past more enjoyable because if we can understand those then we can start to dig in to potentially recreating it in the present so first let's kind of take a step back and take a look at nostalgia from sort of a clinical perspective so why does the brain even do nostalgia in the first place like what's going on here why does the brains think about the past what advantage of any does it serve so a couple of like axioms a couple of assumptions that we're gonna make the first is that the more i've come to understand the human brain and psychology the more i've come to appreciate that even the things that cause us pain serve some kind of function and on the simplest level the fact that we feel pain right that makes our life worse so why on earth have we evolved pain receptors because all it does is hurt us that's because pain actually helps us survive right so pain is a warning that something is wrong whether it's emotional pain physical pain if someone is toxic towards me that's my and i feel emotionally hurt by them that's my brain and mind's way of signaling to me that this could be a dangerous interaction maybe this person doesn't belong in my life things get super super complicated though and we sort of end up you know encouraging that person's abuse of us in some some cases and things like that so that's why we're going to kind of dig in and try to understand why are we nostalgic in the first place so we know from studies on especially things like grief and studies on trauma processing that things like rumination and dwelling on the past are necessary components to emotionally process and then if we emotionally process this essentially causes us to move on so we can see is that like dwelling on the past serves a function okay we also recently talked a little bit about counterfactual thinking which just to give you guys a quick refresher is when we think about things that did not happen so when i go into the past let's say i did got a b on a chemistry test or c on a chemistry test what my mind will do is something called counter factual thinking so it'll go back into the past and it'll imagine scenarios that are factually not true if i had studied i would have gotten a b if i had studied more i would have gotten a if i had done this what if what if if if if this is essentially if thinking because then what your mind is doing is it's thinking about things that are factually incorrect and so what we know from studies on counter factual thinking is that this serves an adaptive purpose too it helps us correct our behavior and it also sort of uh creates a sense of regret that can be used as a motivational drive right so sometimes this can get out of control where like the regret gets so powerful that it negatively impacts our motivation but generally speaking counterfactual thinking is something that we engage in a lot right so we can engage in it we probably engage in it several times a day for all kinds of little things like oh if i had warmed my tea for example for 40 seconds instead of 30 seconds it would have been warm today it would have still been warm right so then i take a sip i'm like maybe i should have used an insulated cup because this amount of unpleasantness can cause me to change my behavior because the truth is that negative emotion is a very powerful influencer of behavior so i don't know that either of these things are necessary nostalgia but we do know that the brain generally speaking or the mind has different functions for going into the past and sort of like thinking about things okay so this is kind of like three examples of maybe why we get nostalgic in the first place so then the question becomes when we think about the past was the past actually better now if the answer is no so one option is no and then why do we think it's better because of cognitive bias so that's okay right because if this is the case then what we need to do is cognitively reframe which is a useful skill so this is something that we actually teach people who are depressed they'll start to think oh in the past like things were so much better my life sucks now and you can cognitively reframe to sort of develop a sense of gratitude actually there are things that i can still be grateful for right some things in my life have gotten better but in the depressed mind it doesn't automatically do that so we'll actually sort of create cognitive flexibility through things like cognitive behavioral therapy okay and then in terms of developing gratitude this is things like method meditation so we can actually deal with the cognitive bias or deal with sort of this idea that life is actually worse for me now because it may not be worse but i don't think that that i think that's a very dangerous solution because what we're sort of doing is like we're not assuming that life was better because maybe if that was your experience it actually was better and if we assume that life actually was better then what we need to do is explore okay what are the variables that made life better because if we can understand that we can potentially recreate those okay so the first thing that i want to kind of talk about for a second is when you're young things are in a lot of ways actually better right so when you're young so i'm gonna just share with you all the story from my own life so when i was like in middle school i played a lot of dungeons and dragons and i had a lot of fun playing a lot of dungeons and dragons and so i would like you know we would play d d basically every weekend we'd play until like four in the morning five in the morning six in the morning we'd play till dawn um and it was just a blast right because back then i did not worry about stuff now that caused me some problems later on so especially going into high school and stuff my grades started to drop things like that i started playing video game we would also have lan parties right so it's not just d it would be like we're gonna do d this weekend or we're gonna have a lan party if it's a three day weekend we're gonna do lan party we're gonna bring all our computers and stuff like that right over thanksgiving and christmas i remember when i was in college i had like all these ideas of like oh my god like i'm i'm so far behind on chemistry one i need to like really catch up because i got a d and i'm going into chemistry two and if i don't like learn chemistry one chemistry two is gonna be i'm gonna be screwed for the second half of my freshman year but when christmas rolls around and all my friends are in town like we're gonna we're gonna grind d because i haven't seen these guys in so long so there are particular consequences that happened later on but especially when we look to earlier times in our life we don't have as many responsibilities and so then you may think okay well now that i have responsibilities does that mean that i'm screwed but no let's actually tunnel down a little bit further what is the effect of a responsibility on your mind so when we think about what responsibility does okay responsibility gets us to think about the future so if i'm like responsible for something my mind will start thinking about the future the other thing that tends to happen as we get older is that we tend to have regrets right hence the nostalgia so as we get older by definition our mind starts thinking more about the future and thinking more about the past and this is like absolutely neuro-developmental so if you look at something like a you talk to a four-year-old or a five-year-old their concept of time is not very well developed and so as a result like you know if you ask a four-year-old like what's gonna happen next year they don't know what a year is so as we get older our concept of time continues to evolve and grow and even with things like social interactions so as we enter puberty we start to realize that people will form opinions of us that will be lasting through time so even an eight-year-old may know what a year is but they don't think in terms of like how is this person gonna think about me one year from now so we start to add a temporal dimension to people's opinions of us during our teenage years and so in that way we add temporal dimensions to all kinds of stuff and as we start to get older we add a temporal dimension to the past because a an eight-year-old doesn't really think about the past a twelve-year-old doesn't really think about the past right a 15 year old starts to think about the past 16 year old thinks about the past a little bit more 25 year old is thinking about the past 30 year old 40 year old 50 year old starts thinking about the past way more so the temporal dimension as we get older grows and if we look at some of this philosophy from like yoga what they sort of say is that the more that you live in the present the happier you're going to be and that a huge source of unhappiness comes from living in the future or living in the past that when i create expectations for myself a year from now or two years from now and i think when i think a lot about the consequences of my actions oh my god what happens if i don't go to this party if i do go to this party what's going to happen what's going to happen what's going to happen what's going to happen the more i start living in the future the more my happiness gets destroyed in the present the more i start living in the past the more my happiness gets destroyed in the present and so we can sort of see that as you become nostalgic it can recall positive emotions but generally speaking anytime i recall positive emotions in the past i may be i have to be careful because if i'm not if i'm not careful what i'm going to do is that's going to create a contrast in the present which is going to create negative emotion which is sort of the function of the future in the past in terms of how it affects our mental health so if we think about why was why was the past so pleasant it's because we were kind of like living in the present right living in the present is what creates pleasantness and as we get older i know this this is not our fault because if we really think about it our society objectively makes us think more about the future and more about the past as we get older we have the luxury of living in the present when we're kids our brain lets us live in the present society lets us live in the present as we get older both of those things change and this is where i think we make a huge mistake because we don't teach or prepare people for this change right so we'll say like vague things like we'll say like enjoy your youth while it lasts but like if someone tells you that they just say that and they laugh and then you're like okay right no one is ever like hey here are the ways that you enjoy things here is what's going to change for you right and it's it's like here and and the other thing is that sometimes people will tell us like by the way adulthood sucks like by the way like you're going to have a mortgage to pay one day okay so like how do i cope with that right so they may even tell us what changes but they don't tell us like how do i deal with that because the truth is that objectively as you get older and your responsibility increases society pulls you away from the present but we're not taught how to hang on to that presentness right so we're like it's a skill but like we're not taught that skill and this is the issue is that when you're young living in the present is easy it becomes very natural and no one pushes you out of it but as we get older and our brain develops we're not taught how to remain in the present even those society and your mind are pulling you into the future and pulling you into the fa into the past so this is a big problem right so like let's look at it objectively like as you get older like you're gonna have you know when you when you're 10 and you go to school you don't have to think about the semester you don't have to think about your grade you just go to school you get your homework you go home presumably do your homework occasionally you'll have a test you kind of have to study for the test but not really so you don't really have to think about the future as you get a little bit older you have to start thinking about tests you have to think about studying then you have to think about paying bills then you have to think about paying mortgages then as you enter your like i mean i varies depending on your culture and your situation but like then you enter into this whole marriage and kids dimension where it's like you know you'll meet someone one day like you're not really too worried about it maybe in 1920 if you're lucky you're still able to live in the present but then we'll also see like 19 year olds and 20 year olds who are terrified of being alone for the rest of their life and i saw these posts where people are like i've been perpetually alone i'm 19 years old and it's like how long is perpetual i've been alone my entire life i'm 16. and it's like you know it's kind of weird to me being as old as i am i mean that that's their experience and it's terrifying for them so i you know i try not to judge but it's kind of interesting right so if you look at that person why is the 16 year old unhappy for being alone their entire life versus the 16 year old who's like yeah i'm not dating i haven't dated anyone so like i'm not dating is more happy so like let's let's just like look at this right so let's look at what adding the temporal dimension does i'm not dating i'm not or i let's do this one actually i haven't dated yet or i've let's do this been alone my entire life okay now here's the thing all of these statements can come from a 17 year old right like this person can objectively be the same age but as and i would say that like this has the least amount of temporal this is like medium temporal and this has a large temporal you all see that so literally adding the temporal dimension is going to correlate with suffering right and as like even as a therapist if i'm working with someone like this the process of cognitive reframing is going in this direction right i'm just not dating this is like in the present okay so as we get older it's kind of interesting but like there's there's an element of temporal dimension which gets added to our lives is we have to start thinking about mortgages and stuff like this and that's where like we tend to start worrying about stuff and we start to feel nostalgic because life was so much simpler because life was simpler like objectively it was simpler you don't have to pay a mortgage your parents weren't like asking you when you're going to have kids because they want grandkids right and like you're sitting there you've got 100k in student loan debt i'm assuming you're american okay you've got 100k in student loan debt you've been dating someone for two or three years housing prices are through the roof you have no idea if you're going to be able to afford a kid and all of that anxiety and all of that worry and all of that pressure your parents don't really appreciate right so we add so much temporal dimension our society adds so much temporal dimension because we need it to survive that's the way that life works the challenge is that we don't really understand that that's what we're doing we don't really understand that that's where the unhappiness comes from and the most devastating thing is that we also quickly jump to the conclusion that that's the only way to do it what other choice do i have this is the way the world is got a big choice right because how much have you tried to step away from the temporal dimension this is where you're gonna say something like oh like what i should just stop paying my bills and ignore everything no right because those are realities we're not saying ignore them but how much does thinking about it actually help it right so if i've got a bill to pay at the end of the month there's a certain amount of like thinking i have to do about it there's a certain amount of work i have to do about it but it's my inability to stop dwelling on it that destroys my happiness i'm not saying that objectively it's better to have more money and like not have bills to pay and stuff like that that's my whole point is that there's an objective decrease in the quality of your life once you become an adult in some ways right but there we can also cognitively reframe because i can have cookies for lunch today if i want to there's some advantages to being adult that's where the cognitive reframe comes in but let's assume for a moment that objectively your life is harder as an adult as a kid than a kid and that that nostalgia was there because you were free of all of your future and past thought so what can you do now okay so there are a couple of important issues that we need to remember okay so the first so how to deal with nostalgic loss so the first thing is that we assume the circumstances create the happiness so i'll give you all the example right so i used to play a bunch of d and so i'm i'm now 39 and like i thought like so i got together recently with some friends of mine and we started playing d d again and i was like man it's gonna be dope i scheduled like a bunch of stuff like and i was like we used to play d and until three or four in the morning and it's so much fun so we get together at two in the afternoon and we're all old men now and like we can't play d d till four in morning we can't eat like taco bell and drink mountain dew by the leader because we're like old men and so like we'll do things like we'll make like a like a fruit plate and we'll play for like six to eight hours yeah my back aches by 7 pm you're damn right i can't sit in a chair for eight hours we got up and we'd take a walk in the middle like we'd go out for a walk and like some of us like i even started doing yoga we were doing like push-ups randomly during the middle of the d d session like we just can't handle the debauchery anymore right you're damn right grapes and cheese not just grapes and cheese it was like strawberries like one person brought pita crackers there was hummus it's like protein right and and so this is the thing is that we assume that it's the circumstances and then what we try to do is we try to recreate that happiness right because this is what the brain does the brain is like what made me happy in the past that will make me happy in the future okay and now some of y'all are saying this is mature d d it sounds dope but here's the thing if i'm trying to recreate my teenage experience of d d it's gonna feel like it sucks it's nowhere near dude we played so much d and d and it's like we just can't handle it anymore so then what you can do is lean into that right make the most of them be like all right we're gonna do like maturity indeed right this is what we're gonna do so like now we plan our menu ahead of time like all right we're gonna do this we're gonna do this you know like we're gonna do some of this stuff you guys want to take a break oh my god so we try to recreate that happiness and thereby we actually lose sight of the present so instead when you kind of notice like your current circumstances you can actually lean into your present to create happiness but as long as you're trying to hold on to the past it's not gonna work and this is the kind of thing where people will say don't hold on to the past but then everyone's like how do i do that like what do you mean by that what does that practically look like what does it mean to not hold on to the past what it means is to recognize that the past is gone recognize that your situation is has changed and try to like literally adjust your current situation based on your circumstances so forget about the past and say okay i want to play d d i like d d but i'm 39 years old i have these friends we have these time commitments how can we make this experience as enjoyable as possible how can i make the the present enjoyable as possible that's how you let go of the past and you optimize it okay the next thing to understand is that like we sort of talked about this a little bit but you know learning to live in the present is key and the key thing here is that we have to understand that this is going to be harder as you grow older because it was natural for you earlier but over time society in your brain is going to add a temporal dimension the temporal stress is going to increase so what you actually have to do is it used to be automatic like it was easy right it's like back when i was in the fifth grade i didn't have to study so i never developed good study habits so then when i hit college like i was sol because now what's going on is like this is my let's say intelligence and here is my here is the difficulty of the material and so this is the gap where i should be learning how to study and if i don't learn how to study then then what's going to happen is like i'm going to be screwed once i cross this threshold right this is going to be like gg this is the gg zone and in the same way this is what you can say the same thing about living in the present as a skill so mindfulness is a skill being able to meditate so over here it's really easy like we don't have to learn how to do it and then we hit this point but then what happens is like no one is like hey by the way the reason that you're struggling right now is because you have not learned the skill of living in the present and then as things get like more and more right we get more and more overwhelmed this redness gets like more and more intense the higher up the bigger this gap is right here the more we begin to suffer and then we find ourselves in our 25 25 year old 26 year old 27 year old if you're in the us for example student loans like it when you're 18 years old and you take out 120 000 of student loans to pay for college you don't really have a temporal appreciation but when you're 25 and 26 and you're paying off your student loans and you recognize that like this is gonna have a temporal effect for the next eight years of your life boy does that hurt right and then that's that's the the barrier of this pain and this is where people are sort of talking about things like oh like you know cancel student debt and stuff like that and it's not my place to comment on whether that's a good idea or a bad idea but what i'm saying is that you sure you can cancel student debt but it's not the other thing that you can not the other thing in addition to that learning how to live in the present is a skill so this is where like the solution to these temporal problems people are sort of looking for circumstances they're looking for like this thing to change and come down here so we try to create recreate the circumstances of being debt-free we try to recreate the circumstances of plain dnd we try to recreate these circumstances of the past the problem is that the more we lean into that strategy the more screwed we are because you can never get the past back that's a big revelation of living in the present so the third thing to understand is that life is changing in transient by nature so this can have a couple and i encourage you all to just think about this because this can have a couple of transformative impacts on your life so when you start to think about how life is changing and transient the first thing that happens is people get terrified they're like how do i hold on to something because that's what we want to do right we want this happiness for the rest of our lives and so then what happens is like if we're not even careful the acknowledgement that life is trans transient damages our happiness because then what happens is anytime we're happy we're like when am i gonna lose this when is the other shoe gonna drop when will this leave and then you can't even enjoy it because you're paranoid about losing it because dr k told you on the internet that life is is transient and nothing lasts forever so now i'm terrified because i want to hold on to it but if you really kind of focus for a little while and you start to really think through it it can transform it's like hard it's kind of binary and is where you got to meditate and really like just think about it okay if life is transient how do you want to live what's the only way to live the only way to live is in the present right so you can sit there you've got this one thing in front of you this tea is cooling with every passing second i can't keep it hot forever it's the only choice i have for happiness the only way i have to enjoy the tea is to drink it now because i can't keep it warm forever so the only way the only solution is to act now to embrace the present and then what happens is like it's kind of interesting because this can be transformed because once you realize that now is the only time to enjoy it you will enjoy it fully right so i want you all to think a little bit about like you know if you get one thing before you die it's like a coin flip where that is either gonna be like you know the best thing of your life or it's gonna taste awful because all you're thinking about is the impending loss right so like once you realize that things are transient like that's when you can really start to enjoy them it's kind of bizarre but once you realize that this flower is only going to be in bloom for this moment or this amount of time and i don't know instead of being paranoid about when the flower petals will fall off and when the fragrance will go away just enjoy the flower right and then you can look back on it you can say wow that was a great flower then you have to be a little bit careful because you can say oh i wish there was another one but the more that you're thinking i wish there was another one the more you're losing sight of the thousand things around you that you can only enjoy in this moment and so once you adopt this kind of mind shift which i'm not saying is easy you have to understand that like look at all of the temporal influences on your mind and then set all of those temporal influences aside for a moment this is why it's a practice it's a skill and try to enjoy just one thing and then what you'll realize which is like really neat is that your enjoyment of the thing is actually determined by your presence in the moment that even this tea even though it's cooler can still be enjoyed right there are some things about it that i can appreciate and so the more that you move in that direction i'm not saying you should ignore your bills it's just like work when you need to work and then have satisfaction that today i've done what i can i've moved sure like you know i'm not making much money right now but like i've moved in the direction that i need to to like it's gonna take me eight years to pay off my student loans but i did what i could today and i've worked for eight hours or nine hours i did one hour of overtime i've chipped away at it and then i have two or three hours i'm gonna try to enjoy myself as best as i can right so that's what it means to live in the present be cognizant of it be recognized that your life may be objectively worse and that you can still extract water from the stone that is life it's absolutely possible it doesn't feel that way right it feels like you can squeeze and squeeze and squeeze and you're not getting anything out of it but that's because of the way that you're living because all you're thinking about is the eight years of suffering so even today like whether you have eight years of suffering or one if you're paying off your student loans tomorrow or you're paying off your student loans in 30 days or 30 years the sandwich that you eat today is going to taste the same you can either enjoy it or not enjoy it right this is what people are going to say but yeah but like if i like if i didn't have student loans to pay like i'd eat like a very fancy sandwich and it would taste better sure i'm not saying that that isn't true but even the some the humble grilled cheese can be delicious but the more that you're in your head about paying off your debt the less you're gonna enjoy the grilled cheese yeah and someone is saying being out of debt does not equal happiness by the way right so that's another big thing but that's like that's exactly my point is that happiness is somewhat independent of your circumstances there's also data that shows that financial security makes people more happier or i would i wouldn't say makes people more happy i would say is fertile ground for happiness to grow in so in my experience financial security and financial freedom is like the quality of the soil you can still get a desert rose but it's way easier with a bunch of fertilizer this is all we got how does that go over our heads because it's easy because we're not thinking about what we have we're thinking about what we used to have and we're thinking about what we could have that's how all we've got goes over our heads so i know it's kind of weird but at the end of the day i think that nostalgia like if we kind of just recap right so nostalgia is there for a reason we know that there are a lot of different functions in the mind whether it's trauma processing grief processing counterfactual thinking for performance improvement which is why our mind goes into the past in the first place now is does the past seem better just because of cognitive bias and memories and selection bias and stuff like that there may be an element of that especially if you're in a depressive mindset right because then you're going to compare and contrast and you're going to take you're going to come to the worst conclusions and you're going to your mind is going to be like moving away from positive information but i think if we sort of stop there if i were to say yeah your brain does it because it's evolved to do it and yeah it's all cognitive bias in your head that doesn't actually help you in this moment because if we look at it objectively the past is usually better right if we're thinking about better times like there's a lot to say about the past actually being better and a lot of that has to do with our innocence and what does innocence mean innocence means living in the present right it means not having that temporal dimension and what happens as we get older is we start thinking about time more we have to society makes us do it our brains make us do it and no one teaches us by the way as your brain starts thinking about time more your propensity for anxiety will increase your propensity for regret will increase your fear of the future will increase your ability to enjoy yourself in the present will become harder so let me teach you how to account for that difference right because we teach people how to stretch like kids don't need to stretch that much adults need to stretch a lot you know the number of adults that i've seen that have pulled a muscle or the number of times that i've pulled a muscle when i was a kid and the kind of crazy physical stuff that i used to do versus now it's like night and day i used to do way more way crazier stuff and now like picking up a child i pulled muscle in my back by picking up a child so as people as we as we like grow older like we warn people and so we have stretching baked into our society like you learn how to stretch even though you don't really need to as a kid right but we don't teach us like what is this what is that cognitive flexibility what is the cognitive stretch that we need to do to be able to enjoy and appreciate the present because the more that we hold on the past the more that we try to recreate the past the more it's not going to work because life is different now and so we have to learn how to like live in the present learn how to craft things to our benefit so instead of assuming if you liked a particular activity instead of just trying to recreate that experience try to optimize it for today so how are things different how can i make this as as pleasant as possible you know when i'm making grilled cheese should i switch from butter to olive oil because olive oil is a little bit healthier right there are all kinds of optimizations that you can do questions how can we separate present thinking from making impulsive decisions i could see it as a justification for doing risk risky things you're absolutely correct so present thinking is oftentimes used as like a justification for making bad decisions right we talked about that a little bit so that's where i think that let me think about that this for a second it's a good question so here's what i'd say present thinking is not willfully ignoring the future or the past so to be in the present means also a present focused appreciation for the future right so like i i don't know if this is gonna kind of make sense but it's it's sort of subtle so in my present circumstances let's say i have a ten thousand dollar loan to pay i can worry about the ten 10 000 loan i can say oh i'm living in the present therefore i'm going to completely ignore the 10 000 loan but that's not actually living in the present because in the present you have that 10 000 of debt so the real road is somewhere in the middle where it's like in my present circumstance i have a loan which i am paying off at the rate that i am comfortable with and i'm going to enjoy today i don't know if that makes sense but sometimes what people will do is they'll use present focused thinking as a way to ignore their present circumstances whereas that that's a present circumstance you can't actually ignore that and that's why it's a skill because it's really easy to do one it's really easy to do the other it's doing it in the middle where you're like okay i'm acknowledging that i have ten thousand dollars of debt i'm not going to pay it off today i'm gonna pay off twenty dollars of it today and i'm gonna pay off twenty dollars for the next you know if i pay twenty dollars a day over one course of over the year it'll be six thousand dollars right more seventy two seventy two thousand seventy three thousand dollars i'm sorry seven thousand three hundred dollars right so that that's how you do it it's like i'm gonna pay my 20 bucks today it's an appreciation of the debt it's acknowledgment of the present and like i'm gonna enjoy the rest of it right so i earned 40 bucks a day i'm going to pay off 20 of that i'm going to enjoy the rest make sense yeah so how do you deal with all the bad emotions like getting older feeling lonely lacking purpose do you have to confront those feelings absolutely we'll get to that in a second the next thing we're going to talk about relates to that somewhat ah so so so like getting older is has a temporal component right so like when we say like it has a comparative component so the way that you deal with all of these kinds of things so lacking purpose too generally speaking like lacking purpose is like a temporal emotion i'm not like sitting there on the toilet like sometimes this can happen where you can have like an existential panic attack where like lacking purpose like hits you in the present but generally speaking lacking purpose is like a emergent property right you lack purpose over the course of a day or a week or a month or a year or a decade and you can work on that so that's where like confronting those feelings is important because negative feelings are signals for you to change right so it's okay like you have to acknowledge them like if you're lonely like that's something that you can do something around right that's also where like negative emotions are also compasses to move you in the right direction so i was talking to someone who was an artist and they were kind of saying to me that they realized one day that like they were unsatisfied with their music and they used to beat themselves up about it a lot because of the dissatisfaction but then one day they realized that the dissatisfaction of the music is like a sign of their good taste and also when that feeling is satisfied that's when they know they've made good music and so they they course correct over and over and over again and they kind of lean into that dissatisfaction and that's how they know how it needs to be fixed so if they're dissatisfied with a piece of music that they make what needs to be better about it they make that change what needs to be better about it they make that change and as they move in that direction they wind up with satisfaction and they wind up with award-winning music and so even things like feeling lonely can be the same way it's like what are the times in your life what should you gravitate towards if you feel lonely what i've realized is that as i get older i'm more likely to project my momentary pain as if life will be this pain from now on what can you suggest to that remove the temporal component right so that's exactly what we're talking about so your mind is going to project this present circumstance into the future i'll be alone forever news flash you can't see the future no one can so that thought i know is kind of weird is like actually just wrong like unless you have a time traveling machine or you're talking to someone from the future you have no idea what the future holds the other interesting thing to remember is that that is going to make all kinds of impacts on your current behavior because if this pain will last forever if it's a certainty of the future what does that do to your motivation right so there's there's a people have done studies on hopelessness and rats and once you create hopeless circumstances for a rat so it's kind of a cruel study it's a slight trigger warning here what they'll do is they'll drop a rat in like a bucket of water and they'll see how long it swims before it gives up there's no way out right they don't actually drown the rat once it gives up they pull it out but that hopelessness once you have hopelessness you give up and you stop trying and so the problem is that once we start to think that momentary pain is forever we give up the challenge is that unlike the experiment there ain't no bucket and no one's gonna pull us out so there is actually a path forward it's not artificially closed it feels that way to us but the moment we give up that's when we actually drown because the circumstances are very different no one's going to pull us out which sucks but on the upside we're not actually in a bucket right we're in a pool of water and there's a shore somewhere there's land somewhere so understand that your mind may want to do that notice the activity of the mind as it tries to project into the future notice what it does to your motivation and your desire for effort and then recognize that you can't really like that thought is coming that future projection is actually coming from an emotion it's not coming from a logical place and even if you say but i have all this evidence i'll be alone forever don't you see i'm 17 years old and i've asked out two people or i've asked out or i'm 25 years old and i've asked out 25 people you can have as much evidence as you want to but people can be alone until they're not right that's where like maybe you need to be a little bit more careful about how you ask people out like you may have some kind of like red flag in your process right so like be reflective don't just assume like it's the reason that you're alone may have something to do with your behavior so we're not i'm not disputing your evidence i'm just saying that your evidence is incomplete and doesn't necessarily conclude that you shouldn't bother with anything more practically there are practices that can teach your mind to live in the present to train yourself to be in the present all meditation does this so meditation will help with that okay so universal emperor is saying the present sucks i disagree with that in 98 of cases so in my overwhelming experience the more you lean into the present the better life gets i wish i could say a hundred percent but i've had a couple of experiences where all of my meditative strength and energy and mana and experience fall short for me with nausea and vomiting which like i just can't enjoy the present when i'm puking i've tried boy have i tried um but like in most cases like including social things work things setbacks all that kind of stuff like you can still enjoy the present you
