you all ready let's do it okay nope so why do i 19 male get so triggered by people having a different opinion from me and how do i fix it at 14 years old my dad left the family i was raised by him to be one of those men who doesn't show any emotions and i got pretty good at it i don't know when but at some point that year i decided this sucked and started training myself to show more emotions i was home schooled up until 18 so i was very sheltered and pretty much got anything social from my family their close friends or the internet during that time i was very active on twitter joined a ton of fandoms and was around people who believed in the same stuff and enjoyed the same things i did one toxic thing about social media is everyone quote retweets stuff they disagree with and spreads it eventually i started muting nearly every word that could possibly show me any anything like racism lgbt phobia islamophobia eventually i started to mute stuff i like so i didn't have to see other people's opinions on it because anything bad would lead to a panic attack i also had 30k blocked users i decided to leave twitter in 2021 because i didn't want to deal with the panic attack with a panic attack every week fast forward to 2022 and i'm a mess well i've successfully interacted with other people and don't suffer from social anxiety to my surprise i still suffer from the same problem anyone who has a different opinion from me call or call something i like bad can risk making me feel 24 times worse while i no longer suffer from panic attacks for the opinion reason and while irl is is not as bad as it was online it's still a problem i deal with sometimes i get huge urges to look up triggering content or scroll through a sub that is the opposite of what i love or look up bad reviews for shows i like and i have no idea what the motive is sometimes i do it and make my mental health worse i know i'm the problem here and i'm not going to change everyone's mindset nor do i want to but i would like advice on dealing with this great post so today a chat what i'd like to talk to you all about is generally speaking the concept of like ego identity and like how to grow in a positive way with respect to these things these are things that we've seen a lot of interest about in the last couple of months even i guess years like since the beginning of our community but i think that as people sort of start to learn some of the basics about ego and identity what we've sort of discovered is that there's more and more interest for learning like more about this stuff so what i'd like to do today is kind of walk y'all through um how can we understand this situation and the key things that i'm going to point out are so this is a person who gets very upset when people have differing opinions from them right so there's like there's going to be some issues here that we're going to kind of dig into okay so let's go ahead and and take a look at those so the first is i want y'all to kind of so we're going to be talking today about the ego or the sanskrit ahamkar and i like the sanskrit definitions because remember that the eastern perspective of the mind was developed through introspection so these are yogis that are sitting you know in a cave in the mountains just with their eyes closed and observing their mind whereas the western perspective of the mind is developed more objectively and externally so like if we think about you know major contributors to the western models of the mind they're people who made scientific observations the key thing about scientific observations is that they're from the outside right so sigmund freud would listen to people speak and using their words would approximate a model of the mind based on people's words now the downside of this i think is very simple there's upsides and downsides the downside is that just think a little bit about the gap between your words and the functions of your mind right there's a pretty big gap there generally speaking as we become trained listeners and things like that we can try to shrink that gap as people become more authentic we can try to shrink that gap but ultimately i don't know how good words are it is tools to understand internal processes the upside of the western method is that it's objective right so if i'm studying my own mind i'm going to be subject to cognitive biases whereas in the objective model like especially if you look at like cognitive behavioral therapy or like the work of aaron beck these are people or the behaviorists right they made like lots of observations and so you can use the benefit of science use the benefit of lots of subjects to come to a more objective answer the reason that i'm going to talk about sort of the eastern perspective today is because i find that the eastern perspective is more relatable as an individual so for example if i say this is the edible complex and i can explain intellectually the edible complex and people can even say oh yeah like that on some level describes my experience the challenge is that your experience of your mind from moment to moment is is less likely to map on very easily to the edible complex it requires like a lot of work to bridge that gap whereas the eastern perspective of mine the reason i like it is because it seems very accessible to people like this is a model of the mind that i've taught to like 10 year olds and they sort of get it okay so let's let's just talk a little bit about the ego or the hum guard so the first thing that i want to point out is that generally speaking when we have kind of toxic or negative influences there are two ways that we can deal with them okay one is externally so in this case this person is blocking people right and this sort of makes sense like we can limit our environment so one way is to externally deal with the stimuli right so what we want to do is kind of like we want to limit what enters our senses or indriyas so the ego or the hump guard is the sense of identity we're going to take sort of an eastern perspective and if we look at that post we remember that there are toxic or negative influences and the way that this person is dealing with those toxic or negative influences is largely through external sources so they're blocking people on twitter and the yogis sort of understood this as well this is why people will go to monasteries or ashrams for you know like spiritual study for example this is why we like go to school right so we tend to control our external environment to facilitate a certain kind of action within the mind so changing our environment can be very very important but there's another aspect here which can be internal right so if we think about like i don't know that you block 30 000 people on twitter but think a little bit about you know anytime something external happens that's a disruptive anytime something is offensive to your sense organs or triggers some kind of negative emotion the solution isn't necessarily to just block it right so there's some amount of like internal dealing with negative things and that's what i'm going to call resilience and so what tends to happen if we kind of think about you know why do i call that resilience it's like what do we think of as resilience resilience is the ability to like tolerate and withstand like negative things right so someone who's resilient can deal with some amount of like punishment or toxicity or whatever so what we're going to explore today is sort of this this aspect here and because it seems like this person has done a really good job of sort of externally controlling their environment so what i want to kind of point out is that resilience is the way that we sort of tolerate what i'm going to call discordance so if i believe thing a and someone believes thing b resilience is sort of the ability to like tolerate this gap right so this is what resilience is so if if i think that i'm you know a good person and someone is calling me a bad person my ability to tolerate them saying that has something to do with my degree of resilience right so if my teacher says oh you're terrible at math but deep down i know i'm good at math like i'm resilient i'm not going to let that affect me or i won't let it affect me very much so this kind of internal this discordance between you and the outside world is like what i sort of think of as resilience the other thing that we can talk about this the other word that we can use here is confidence and this is going to become important especially as we start talking about ego right so if we think about someone who's confident they can tolerate discordant opinions so if i'm confident in my let's say atheistic beliefs and there's someone i'm talking to who has very religious beliefs i can sort of acknowledge that like yeah i don't think you're correct like i believe what i believe you believe what you believe like that's totally fine i happen to think that you're wrong and that i'm correct but like i'm not gonna get bent out of shape over it right it's not gonna affect me like emotionally or powerfully it's not gonna send me into a panic attack you can easily reverse the scenario right you can say someone who's religious there's someone who's atheistic you may disagree with them and that's totally fine we're not saying one person is right or one person is wrong what i'm talking about is internally how confident you are and how resilient you are determines how much you can tolerate differing opinions or discordance between you and the outside world so the other thing to understand is that the ego needs concordance right so we say that the confidence doesn't necessarily need concordance you can tolerate people disagreeing another simple example is like let's say you decide to break up with someone or someone decides to break up with you and it's kind of like an amicable breakup because both you all decide okay this is like not the right relationship nothing against you personally it doesn't mean i'm a bad person or you're a bad person it's just not working out so if you have two confident people in a relationship who sort of mutually kind of decide like this is not the right fit like they can walk away from that without getting emotional about it without getting i mean there may be some emotions which is totally fine but not getting like their egos attacked right oh like why are you doing this to me oh my god i'm so pathetic i'm sorry i failed you oh my god you're so pathetic like why can't you be better so that's like the action of ego right the confidence is like different from that there's a whole video about confidence versus ego and dr k's guide and i'm almost half assuming that people have sort of watched that but if you are more interested in that we go into more detail but we'll kind of continue going now so the ego needs concordance another good example of this is like if we think about someone who's egotistical like they need praise right because the thing about ego is that if we say that confidence and ego are at the opposite ends of a spectrum right and you can either move this way or this way we can think about the egotistical person as someone who like needs reassurance from the outside world that's why they're egotistical that's why they'll they'll advertise their successes right these are people who will be very very vocal about their successes they'll be vocal about how much money they make they'll be vocal about the car they drive they'll be vocal about how they're better than other people they'll be really really vocal and why is that it's because since you don't believe it about yourself you have to convince other people right so you want something to be true and like the more that you can convince other people the better off you will feel about yourself because internally you don't really feel it yourself so the ego unlike the confidence or the lack of the ahamkar needs concordance right and what resilience is is the capacity to tolerate discordance and when we are not resilient or we sort of don't have that confidence within ourselves sometimes the most effective solution we come up with is to block people is to limit our external surroundings right i just can't tolerate this kind of thing because it makes me feel bad not quite sure why or how but like so i'm gonna shut it off which is okay like you can do that right that's like a healthy part of it like we said earlier monks engage in the stuff students engage in the stuff it's not bad it's just important to understand what your options are and actually use both of them so the next thing to understand um about kind of ego is that like let's kind of go back to um let's actually take a quick tangent and talk about attachment theory for a second so i know that this is sort of an eastern perspective but if y'all are interested in sort of the science behind some of this stuff we can talk about attachment theory for a second so how do we develop confidence right so this is the main question okay dr k you're saying that confidence is is good ego is bad so like how do we develop confidence and this is where thankfully like scientific research right so this is western psychology um you know the there are a lot of excellent uh uh researchers who sort of developed this idea called attachment theory and attachment theory essentially is like in my opinion or i don't know if it's the best but it's the scientific explanation for confidence that i personally like the most so some people go through life and are confident other people go through life and are not confident right this is like a general state of their being and sure confidence can vary in terms of whether we're talking about lost ark or plumbing right but like generally speaking some people are more outgoing more confident some people are more concerned that the world is a dangerous place and a simplistic way to kind of dig into that attachment theory is very very vast and deep and complex i'm going to try to over some oversimplify here for a second but what the researchers in attachment theory essentially discovered is that when we are emotionally mirrored early in childhood we develop confidence okay so i'm going to talk a little bit about what this means so early on when we're like one year old or two years old or three years old what happens is like we don't understand the world right like the world doesn't make sense it's entirely new so the way that we develop confidence what people noticed is that when children are around adults that emotionally mirror them those are the children that become confident so when i like fall trip and fall and i hurt myself i'm feeling pain right i don't know exactly what that is because i'm a one-year-old like i don't understand the philosophy of pain all i know is that it hurts i'm not i'm kind of confused like i'm a kid i don't understand stimuli yet right all i know is in a vague sense it hurts so then when people around me respond right so when my parents come and pick me up they're like oh poor baby and this is also interesting because it's conserved between cultures but generally speaking parental figures and other adults will have exaggerated emotional responses with children so it's like if the child walks up to you and like shows you like look i have a pen like do we are we like oh whatever dude why are you showing me that that's not how adults respond right how adults respond is like oh my god that's a white pen where did you find the white pen so we have this exaggerated emotional response oh my god did baby get hurt oh my poor thing let me pick you up let me hold you oh my poor darling my poor precious my child oh my god are you okay so we have these exaggerated emotional responses right so and why is that and that's because like actually what happens is when we have an exaggerated emotional response it actually demonstrates to the child what they're feeling so children will learn oh okay like i'm feeling sad and they'll see your facial expression and they'll see like okay that's sadness or that support or like so so what happens is in the world there's concordance between what the child experiences and how adults respond to them and essentially what happens is when kids sort of have a lot of concordance between their internal experience and the rest of the world then the world makes sense there are rules to the game right so think about it this way if i'm a kid and i get hurt and then like instead of being supported if my parents start yelling at me for crying like what do i learn about the world i learned that the world is like a confusing place right where like if i get hurt like i should be punished for getting hurt that's the sort of lessons people take away and so the if the world is like confusing and so what the attachment theory researchers um sort of discovered is that when there's like variable emotional responses based on from caregivers so a good example of this is like alcoholics so i'm an alcoholic parent while they're sober like they're gonna be loving and caring but while they're drunk they're gonna be like angry and yell at me and stuff like that so then what happens is like i determine that the world is a confusing place where i don't know the rules and if i don't know the rules how can i move about the world with confidence right so if you think about like how do kids get confidence because they like learn how stuff works like how does a child develop confidence with walking it's because like walking is the same every single time now imagine like trying to learn how to walk if like every other day or for a few hours a day when your parents are drunk suddenly like gravity turns off right like it would be so much harder to work the rules of the game have changed and once you don't understand the rules of the game like it's hard to move about confidently in the world okay so this is kind of a quick aside to attachment theory but the key thing is that concordance or emotional mirroring instills confidence okay so even if we bounce to the post for a second right this is where like remember like when we were looking at the post what we sort of saw was that okay dad left the family raised doesn't show any emotions and i got pretty good at it right homeschooled as well so what we're sort of noticing is that like we're not really 100 sure right so we could ask more questions to this person about their upbringing but they definitely appear to have some kind of setup that suggests like sub-optimal emotional mirroring right including an emotionally unavailable father who then after the age of 14 like left so that's like kind of it's unfortunate right but this is what happened this is the truth of the world is that sometimes that's how we grow up so this is kind of a quick aside that sort of demonstrates that concordance and emotional mirroring instill confidence okay so now let's go back to this person's main question which is like why can't i tolerate disagreement right that's kind of the core question here and so generally speaking i think the main reason for this is a lack of faith in yourself right this kind of goes back to the ego point but if i um if i am uh you know if i'm confident in myself like i can tolerate people disagreeing with me if i'm egotistical like if i'm insecure about my appearance i need lots and lots of compliments about my appearance right whereas if i'm very secure in my appearance like people could even be insulting and like i would generally speaking be okay with that right i mean i'm not saying that you're impervious to it so every time you get an insulting comment like it's going to chip away at your confidence a little bit generally but you know your resilience your capacity to tolerate negativity is going to be high if you're confident in yourself and if you can't tolerate discordance with the outside world it generally comes down to like i think a lack of faith in yourself and so this is where once you have a lack of faith in yourself or if you haven't developed this kind of attachment theory emotional mirroring confidence kind of stuff you don't really know like who you are you don't really understand that deep down you're a good person then what tends to happen like so when we don't have an understanding of who we truly are when this is a question mark when we don't understand who we truly are we tend to feel this is the key part about ahamgar okay when we don't understand who we truly are when we lack confidence in ourselves what we tend to do is fill in the gap with external things right so this is going to be kind of a random aside we'll go into this more more detail later but remember in the yogic concept we have a true self there's a really easy version way to understand your true self just close your eyes for like five minutes and just experience whatever you experience and this is where like it's kind of weird but like what you're going to discover is it's like relatively neutral right there's not going to be like much gender to your experience i mean maybe you're you know you do have some physical sensations that denote some kind of gender but generally speaking throughout your day like you know the color of your skin is going to be irrelevant in terms of your experience people may react to you differently but if i'm like sitting outside in the sun like you know my ethnicity doesn't really matter that much sure there may be like some element of sunburn depending on you know how much uh melon and my skin cells have and things like that but generally speaking like you know the color of my skin or the color of my hair or things like that it won't matter in terms of like everyday experiences right so if i if i take a sip of tea like the experience of tasting the tea doesn't matter whether i'm 15 30 or 45 doesn't matter whether whether i'm a man or woman it doesn't matter matter whether i have long hair or short hair the experience of life is like independent generally speaking of identity oh i'm talking about like an actual moment in time right so this is where you can say but what about things like racism and stuff like that but yeah so but even then so if if i'm attacked by someone due to my race my experience of that attack is actually independent of race right so if someone like you know physically attacks me because of the color of my skin my experience of that moment of physical pain is actually independent of this color of my skin is it being caused because of racism absolutely so we're not saying that that's not important we're saying is that the actual experience of let's say getting you know pushed to the ground is independent of any kind of identity it sucks for all people right so this is what the yogis sort of discovered is that there's this true self which is actually described by neti neti and what neti neti means is a sanskrit phrase for not this not this so any attribute that you can define yourself with is not actually the true self so and then we have the false self and this is the ahamgar this is the ego and this is where we have all kinds of attributes right so i was valedictorian top of my class or i'm a failure whereas like at the end of the day you know anyone if you're just sitting in the sun or you're taking a bath like whether you're a failure or a success whether you're a billionaire or a popper like it sort of doesn't matter right the experience of water on your skin is stable so what tends to happen is the less we understand this and this is also where like confidence brings us closer to the true self i think that's what it really is is like confidence is like an understanding of our true self the more we tend to fill in the gap with external things and so then what happens is we begin to form an identity around beliefs okay so like a good example of this is like if you don't really know who you are who you if you don't know who you are you substitute who you are with things that you believe so you all may know like people who have identities that revolve around like a particular thing like a cause or a political belief or some kind of like moralistic stance so one of the things that terrifies me is how immoral people who believe in a good cause can be and a good example of this is like what i would call the angry vegan so i have nothing against veganism veganism is actually like probably very good for the environment from biomass perspective it's fantastic from a health perspective it's really good but sometimes you'll encounter someone who's like an angry vegan right and so like being a vegan is not just something that they do it's not like they're just trying to like do something good for the environment and like it's a choice that i make i'm cool with it like it'd be awesome if more people were vegan but like you do you i'm gonna do me that's sort of like a confident vegan and then we have the angry vegans and the angry vegans are like you know they're like very very hurt and offended and and very aggressive and if you try to like engage them in discussion they're gonna actually be like somewhat like toxic and judgmental and things like that veganism becomes a whole part of their identity like who they are is vegan it's not just a lifestyle choice it's like a completely transformative way of life and once again nothing against vegans you know i think it's fantastic if you decide to become a vegan like you do you and like good for you and probably good for the environment and good for your body so fantastic the next example of this is people who are very very political right so like where politics is no longer just you know a choice it's like it becomes a core part of our identity it becomes part of who we are and so um you know the other thing that we sort of see with these people is once again once you start to have like you know on a humgar or uh you know ego develop around these core beliefs that these have to be heavily advertised right so most of like the calm chill confident vegans are not like super aggressive in advertising on social media the people who like advertise on social media and are like being very very um you know aggressive towards people are the ones that have to like advertise like how awesome of a vegan they are and are like very judgmental towards other people so we can see once again that like the ego which requires external support is relates to our sense of identity and that that sort of engages like the more that people go down the egoistical route the more vocal they become like you could vocally advocate for things without being egotistical but that's also where like you can you can sort of notice the difference in terms of how they engage other people in discussion right so if if like someone engages you know a confident vegan in discussion like they're not gonna make personally slanderous remarks right they're just gonna be like yeah you know i disagree with you here are the reasons why so it's kind of like a civilized discussion between an atheist and a religious person or an uncivilized discussion between like die hard religious people and like die hard atheists right those are very different things and so you know what we end up seeing with the ego is since you doubt you have to demonstrate because you don't really know who you are you're not really confident in yourself and with the absence of those things if you don't if you don't know you yourself or a good person you have to work really really hard to convince everyone else that you're a good person and the way that you do that is by demonstrating very very loudly right because the more people you can convince that you are a good person the more your insecurity will like feel kind of calmed down because you know like oh if like a thousand people think i'm a good person then i must be a good person because deep down within your own mind you're not sure you're not truly confident right so insecurity will sometimes manifest in this way with trying to be like aggressive with other people and like convincing people of things so let's kind of go back to this person's situation okay so let's try to recap for a moment so this is someone who gets triggered by the opinions of others okay and what we kind of notice is that like anyone who has a different opinion from me or calls something i like bad can risk making me feel 24 times worse so that's kind of really interesting right so when people disagree i feel bad which is kind of weird right so i want you all to just think about that for a second how does a disagreement become a judgment or personally emotional experience right like it's kind of strange right so like it's like it's kind of like i like pepperoni pizza and someone else is like i like pineapple pizza and then like i feel bad like that's weird right so we can say like depending on which camp you're in you know you are an uncivilized barbarian for liking that how dare you but if we really kind of stop and think about it there's something weird going on here like why does someone feel personally bad based on an external disagreement or opinion that someone like another human being holds and this is the kind of thing where like this is where ego comes in right so this is like where i would like this is where i would ask you know one question so if you're in this kind of situation where you get personally like feel bad or feel attacked or need everyone around you to kind of agree with what you say the key question to ask yourself is if someone disagrees what does that say about me right because this is the key you'll see this like the key thing is that an external disagreement which can be purely intellectual and totally fine is somehow getting translated into a personal judgment or somehow getting translated into some sense of identity right and so for the people who say what does that say about me it says nothing about me these are the people that are confident but if you really pay attention the people who have a hum cars have egos don't really understand who they are you know haven't been emotionally mirrored early on in life haven't really discovered the true nature of self they're going to be the ones that are like it says something about me right it says that i am wrong like it's kind of bizarre but like you can sort of get the sense from this person's post that you know sometimes i i get huge urges to look up triggering content or scroll through a sub that is the opposite of what i love or look up bad reviews for shows i like and i have no idea what the motive is right sometimes like i do it make my mental health worse it's because what you we'll kind of get to that in a second but what we're sort of noticing is that there's like a a huge internal component to this experience it's about like being perceived in a particular way and like if i can find other people to confirm if i i look up the negative reviews then it confirms what i believe about myself which is that like you know i'm not my opinions aren't good or worthwhile the other place that you'll see this is after a breakup if you're feeling really really bad about yourself right what your mind will do is go and seek out stimuli to confirm what it believes about you so if you're feeling terrible about yourself what you're going to do is go look at pictures of your ex and then you're gonna see like if you see a single picture of your ex with someone else right you don't know if their boyfriend girlfriend you don't know if it's like platonic you're gonna look at all of those pictures and each of those pictures is gonna be a punch to your gut and you just can't help yourself because what your mind is looking for is concordance right that's what the mind craves the mind wants to make sense of the world because now i can navigate it and if i feel a particular way about myself and i go seek out confirmatory stimuli then oh okay like at least i make sense right because what the mind hates more than anything else is confusion even if i am a bad person at least i can navigate my life as a bad person as long as i know i'm a bad person so the mind values concordance over goodness right it it wants certainty over positivity that's really what it wants it's more important for your your mind to be consistent than it is for it to be correct there are a couple of other questions that you can ask yourself which is like how do i feel about myself right and last question is am i a good person so this is a yes or no question so as you start to ask some of these questions what you'll notice is like you're starting to understand okay where am i on this axis of like true self versus false self right am i confident do i really know who i am because a lot of times when i have conversations with people who are sort of in this kind of scenario i'm making a lot of assumptions here but like you know i i if this was someone that i was interviewing on stream i'd ask them like do you how do you feel about yourself do you think you're a good person and and like the answers that i usually get are like i have no idea like how the how the hell are you supposed to even know whether you're a good person like what does that even mean right it's so foreign it's like i guess and sometimes what they'll say is like external things like people tell me i'm a good person right like those or like they'll say like i'm not entirely sure like i don't know like you know so there's just a lot of confusion here where people don't really understand who they are in the absence of understanding who you are you fill it in with ego right you fill it in with external things because your mind needs some way to navigate the world and if it doesn't have a good understanding of who you are internally it's going to pick stuff from the outside and fill in that vacuum so the next uh kind of question to ask is like okay so if you're in this situation what do dr k so the first thing that i want to acknowledge is that if you're actually having panic attacks right that's absolutely a reason to go see a licensed mental health professional like because i know it sounds like you figured out the source of your panic attacks as you know through limiting twitter but if this is a tried and true panic attack like you know you may want to get that checked out right so if you're experiencing impairments or you're concerned about possible impairments then you should absolutely go see a licensed professional okay so you may want to you know see a therapist and if you're like is it a true panic attack or not a true panic attack i don't know and that's like like you're not supposed to know right that's the job of a therapist so one of the things that you know clinicians do is like they have to evaluate you so another thing that i see is that a lot of people think like okay how do i know if i need help like how do i know if it's bad enough to need treatment whereas that's the wrong question because you're not the one who's going to make that evaluation right it's actually like half the job of a clinician is diagnosis so if you're concerned at all or you're like it's a question mark for you then you should absolutely go see someone next thing to think a little bit about just a reminder right is we talked about attachment theory and even if you don't have a um even if you don't have a panic disorder right which it's important for the therapist to sort of figure out or the clinician to figure out there's also like other things going on here like attachment theory which like attachment theory is what most therapists are trained in like basically at least in the us as far as i know like everyone learns some attachment theory because it's so central right so if you go see like a child and adolescent psychiatrist for example they're more likely to have advanced training and attachment theory and things like that but there's like a lot of benefit from you know working with someone who really understands attachment theory and then the next thing is that unfortunately there's no substitute that's terrible handwriting for a good relationship so even if we sort of think a little bit about what's going on for people in this situation like this person is looking for external concordance right so it's almost like as a kid we need concordance this is how we get emotional mirroring and develop confidence and then as an adult if we didn't have this right that's still what we're looking for right so now we understand like okay why we're blocking people on twitter need concordance right you're still looking for someone to like help you understand and like meet you where you're at so we start to shape our external environment looking for concordance in the worst cases sometimes what we'll do is enter like you know echo chamber communities where like since we don't have the confidence in our beliefs to tolerate discussion and differing opinions what we'll do is just join people who like believe what we believe right because then we're getting that emotional uh that concordance we're getting sort of emotional mirroring from these other people like if i believe you know that covet 19 is a is a hoax or a conspiracy or something like that which i don't right so covet is not a hoax please get vaccinated but if i believe that sort of thing and like i feel attacked and hurt and bad when people disagree with me then what i'm gonna do is gravitate towards like people who believe the same things i do and then through finding that emotional mirroring and that concordance it sort of assuages some of this like internal lack of confidence kind of stuff so in a weird way like even as adults we're trying to do what we didn't get to do in children and this is where if you look at broadly like you know theories of child development what tends to happen is like some people get stuck right so you're supposed to do this at one year you're supposed to do this at two years five years 10 years 15 years 20 and 25. and sometimes you'll meet someone who's like developmentally 15 even though they're 25 years old and that's not really their fault it's just like they haven't learned how to do that thing yet right so sometimes you'll you'll meet adults who throw temper tantrums like a five-year-old and like why do they do that it's because they never learned like how to you know grow past that point so sometimes you'll have people who are developmentally like behind where they should be and this is not it's not like just they're globally developmentally behind i mean there is a diagnosis for that called global developmental delay but generally speaking most human beings like none of us are you know exactly at 20. some of us will be like developmentally advanced and be like at 25 and be precocious in some ways we'll be like a little bit developmentally like a little bit stunning right like so like intellectually mathemate-wise like i'm a 20-year-old who's like my reading level is like at a 25-year-old's level like emotionally i'm kind of like at a 15-year-old right it was not totally normal so you know unfortunately the truth is that you know if you if what you were missing early in life is a good relationship like sometimes there's just no good substitute for a good relationship and i've sort of seen this a lot where if you look at people who have had like on like very toxic upbringings and stuff like that strong emotional support from either friends or like aunts or uncles or even a romantic relationship can can really help those people like learn how to be like emotionally normal right sort of catch up emotionally so it's kind of unfortunate but you know if you really want to talk about on the grand scope of things what can you do about it like i think forming healthy relationships is a huge part of like how you get out of this right because when you when let's kind of tunnel down into why is this so in a healthy relationship you're going to have disagreements you're going to make mistakes and it is so healing it is so much positivity and xp in terms of emotional development when you make a mistake and someone says you made a mistake i am acknowledging the mistake but you're still a good person huge huge right when someone says yeah you kind of screwed up and i still like you and i still care for you and you're still a good person and i forgive you because what happens until you have that is that your sense of value is determined by mistakes or successes right and this is the there's a video in dr k's guide called conditional love which is like when the love that you were shown is like dependent on the value as a human being that you were dem the way people demonstrated value or your value as a human being was determined by like whether you made mistakes or you were successful very very common and so then once you once your value is not determined by something intrinsic or the true self but is determined by performance then you're going to be squarely grounded in in the false self you're going to have a big ego and you're going to lack confidence right and then you're going to need to prove how smart you are to everyone all the time how successful you are to everyone all the time the last thing that i'd recommend is meditation so there are some meditations about sort of discovering this true self right so like let me just think about how to share kind of a simple meditative practice so like like this is a practice we haven't done in a while so we'll just demonstrate it so what i encourage you to do is is you know go grab a drink or you know if you have one in front of you just like pick it up so we're gonna do something called a tea drinking exercise okay so you can do this with any piece of food or beverage or whatever and so what we're going to do in this practice it's super simple is like we're going to just notice who is the person like doing the drinking right so think about like who you are if someone were to ask you like who are you what would you answer would you probably say something about your profession or your gender your ethnicity or your name right so we can even just pick something as simple as a name and as we take a sip of tea we're just gonna ask ourselves like who is doing the drinking like like is this person the name that you describe yourself as like is that the person doing the drinking and in a sense like sort of yeah obviously right because i'm me but then what i want you to imagine for a moment is imagine that an alien being could observe your consciousness or could implant your your body and experience exactly what you experience for just 60 seconds of sipping tea how would they determine your name from this experience how would they figure out because if this is truly who you are and that's a part of this experience then an external observer should be able to find your name through drinking tea right and so like now we're going to try so just kind of think a little bit just observe who is the person who's drinking the tea right so notice the flavor the temperature even the scent the feeling of it as it goes down into your throat the aftertaste and now ask yourself like who is doing this drinking is this a man or a woman how would you know if this was all you experienced in life how would you know that this is a man or a woman or someone who's non-binary right for for your ethnicity how would you know that this person is of a particular ethnicity right and as you tunnel down into the experience you'll start to realize that all of these attributes whether you're rich or you're poor or you're you have a level 39 character in lost ark or a level 15 character in lost ark whether you're a man or a woman all of these attributes whether you're a father or a son none of those are actually relevant in this moment right because in that experience of that moment like that's all the external world it has nothing to do with the internal experience and then the question kind of becomes well then like where do we get these identities well we get them from the outside world and then what the yogis essentially did is they sort of noticed oh that's kind of interesting because when i'm drinking tea i'm a no one i'm netting and then they were like well what happens the moment after i drink tea even now as i'm speaking to you right as you're listening to this are you a man or a woman neither are you rich or you are you poor neither if this is all you have this is the only experience of life you have is this one slice of consciousness none of those things are relevant and then what the yogis sort of figured out and this is the really hard part so you can do this if you want to it's challenging okay is that what is life life is a collection of moments that's all it is so i'm neti neti here i'm neti neti here and then the experience of life is that's it right it cannot be described it cannot like if you just think about the experience of t like we can use words to describe it but i can i can use as many words as i want to but there's no way that you're going to understand the experience of t until you try it yourself right and so if you're stuck in this kind of situation of like being very very concerned about disagreeing with other people feeling bad as a person when other people disagree with you you can absolutely start by you know externally limiting stuff which is very healthy don't get me wrong right so limiting toxicity in your life is really good if twitter is sending you into panic attacks stay the hell off of twitter but the next thing to understand is that remember that we can try to limit our external environment but there's an internal component as well and generally speaking if you want to live a healthy life like you should limit this external stuff and you should become resilient what do i mean by resilience it's the ability to tolerate discordance right and generally speaking resilience comes from confidence where does confidence come from well in attachment theory it comes from emotional mirroring in in the yogic perspective it comes from a lack of ego that ego and confidence are two ends of the spectrum so as we sort of start to think a little bit about okay what is the ego what is the ahamkar it's all of the attributes about your life that are not truly you so it's anything that you can put on a resume and the more the less we understand who we are the more we fill up our identity with the attributes from the resume because we got to put something in there right and this is how you end up with people who are like very very pro-moral cause right these are like crusaders they're like on a crusade for goodness and they're like just leaving a wreckage in their wake right these are people that are you know campaigning for something that they very strongly believe in and if you like talk to them they're like [ __ ] like as human beings they're just [ __ ] but it's okay for them because they're doing something externally that's good for the world right and so if you're kind of getting triggered by the opinion of others when when you sort of when you when people disagree with you if you start to feel bad notice that that's like that's an ego component right like you're injecting your identity or your sense of self-worth into a disagreement with another human being which is like humans are allowed to disagree pineapple and pizza yay like that says nothing about you as a person right but don't we love to think the opposite and lastly when we think a little bit about what to do about it so the first is that if you're actually having like panic attacks or you're concerned that there's something could be going on that's impairing your function strongly recommend you go see a therapist second thing to understand and i know this isn't in everyone's control but at the end of the day if you like didn't grow up with a strong father figure who like taught you these sorts of things that like substituting that replacing that relationship in some way or replacing with other kinds of relationships are really good like that it's just you can't ignore that as a solution we're not saying it's in your control we're not saying it's easy but i would be remiss to say that like if you've had bad relationships in the past one way to fix yourself as a person is to have good relationships like that's a huge part of it right someone who understands that you can make mistakes and still says they value as a person and the last thing is that you can do spiritual stuff right there's actually way more that you can do but today you know i'm going to talk about meditation because this is where this is the systematic process of discovering the true self right so the people were like oh by the way here's how you find it questions that ended up being way longer than i thought it was going to be but that's dr k for you can i recap i just finished the recap we'll get to some of this stuff in the next one though don't worry okay can i repeat it sure so we just talked about a case where someone was sort of saying you know when people disagree with me like i feel really bad so it got to the point where when i saw someone making a comment on twitter that disagrees with my point of view it would throw me into a panic attack so what i did is started blocking people on twitter and then i ended up blocking 30k people and then i got off of twitter entirely and that helped some but i still find myself feeling really bad when people disagree with me so what's going on there and what do i do about it so in summary we have a sense of like confidence on the inside and the more confident we are the closer we are to our true self the more confident we are and the more confident we are the more we can tolerate discordance with the outside world the less confident we are the more egotistical we are and confidence and ego are on opposite ends of the spectrum the more i need the world to get in line with like what i believe right so if i'm egotistical and i'm insecure about my appearance i need everyone to compliment my appearance and if someone says i'm ugly i'm gonna lash out at them right and so what ends up happening is like the reason that these disagreements cause you personal pain is because your identity is caught up in like some of these non-identity like non-self-related things so if someone disagrees with you that makes you feel like you're a bad person or incompetent in some way and so suddenly what happens is like an external degree disagreement becomes a indictment of who you are as a person right so if i if i like lost art then i'm a bad person but if you play league of legends you're a bad person right you see this with dota and league a lot where dota noobs think that everyone who plays lala's noob everyone who plays lol thinks that dota people are noobs like we make determinations about people based on their preferences and so that all has to do with like our our confidence right so as we start to like as you start to tunnel down into that a couple of questions to ask or you know if i feel bad like what does this say about me as a person if someone disagrees with me sorry if someone disagrees with me what does that say about me as a person like and it's kind of weird because technically it does it doesn't say anything but that's not how your mind thinks right your mind feels incompetent if someone disagrees with you it's like you're an idiot that's what your mind is going to be telling you that's why you feel bad so how do you fix that kind of thing well the first thing is to understand that that you know if you are getting panic attacks and things like that like go see a professional second thing is to understand that a lot of this comes from a lack of of like healthy relationships growing up and so healthy relationships is one way to fix it now i understand that's kind of difficult for some people because you can't fix that on your own but the truth of the matter is that sometimes in life like you can't fix everything on your own right it doesn't mean that there aren't things that you can do internally but i've seen a lot of value or yield from having healthy relationships to repair things that unhealthy relationships have damaged right so if you've been in an abusive romantic relationship being in a loving romantic relationship is a great way to fix a lot of that crap probably the most efficient way to be honest the last thing is that you can do personally introspective stuff so today we talked about meditation but there are all kinds of other things you can do right you can read about stoic philosophy you can go for long hikes you can climb to the top of a mountain those are all things that i in a weird way consider spiritual activities not to say that they're spiritual by definition but they get a lot of the benefits that uh systematic spiritual practice will get so if you're not into spirituality that's fine go and explore right like go and test yourself go explore the world go you know try to climb a mountain and like struggle to get to the top and get to the top and feel amazing about yourself those are all ways to build confidence but the meditation we talked about was about the nature of self right and to like drink tea for a moment and um think a little bit about you know what is it that who is doing the drinking right like who like is this person a man a woman non-binary is it you know someone is old young rich poor and then in that moment of experience it's actually none right it's just someone drink a d and the more that you pay attention to your life like on a global scale moment to moment you'll realize that's all you are just someone drinking tea now i'm someone playing lost art now i'm someone who's streaming you know i'm someone who has their hands up like i can just feel my hands up like that's what i am that's all i am in that moment right so i'm not smart or dumb i'm not rich or poor i'm not good or bad i'm not a cult leader or a messiah you know like i'm none of those things right i'm just me so i hope that's a good summary you
