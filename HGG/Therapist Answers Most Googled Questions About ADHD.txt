now what we're gonna do is answer some of the most commonly Googled questions about ADHD why is ADHD on the rise so this is a great question so I think ADHD is on the rise for a couple of different reasons the first reason is because we're becoming more sensitive at picking it up so as our sophistication and awareness of ADHD is on the rise as teachers become aware of it as parents become aware of it we're catching a portion of people who used to be missed ADHD is not simply a neuroscientific illness it's actually a neuroscientific meets environment illness and this is a big Theory that's getting a lot of momentum in Psychiatry which is that mental illnesses don't exist in the vacuum that they actually require a particular environment to come out so for example we also know that like major depressive disorder can manifest in stressful jobs in stressful relationships there's one study that actually shows that the student teacher ratio correlates with the degree of ADHD diagnosis so if I have one teacher and 30 students keeping all of those 30 students on task is very very difficult and so if there's a kid who's got an ADHD predisposition they start to act out more because they don't get as much individualized attention as they need so as we actually increase the number of teachers to students students can get more individualized attention as they get more individualized attention their ADHD shines through a little bit less so the second reason that ADHD is on the rise is because I actually think there's stresses in our school system so as it becomes harder to become a teacher who ultimately suffers the teacher suffers and when they suffer all the kids with ADHD also suffer because if you've got a burnt out teacher they've got a little bit less patience to redirect a child they have a little bit less ability to sit down and sort of help that child practice focus and attention and organization reason number three why I think ADHD is on the rise is simply because of technology so we know that there's a change in technology that is shortening our attention spans and we can see this if we look at generally speaking the way that content is consumed on the internet so if we look at like originally we had blogs right after blogs we had video essays after video essays we had like compilations we had Vines now we have tick tocks so one of the things that's starting to happen is our attention span is shrinking shrinking shrinking shrinking shrinking and as our attention span shrinks we sort of move a little bit societally towards ADHD there are some concerns about things like processed foods and stuff like that something there's also some evidence that as the average age of parents Rises the amount of ADHD may be correlating with that too so there are some epidemiologic factors but I'd say like the three or four major reasons why ADHD is on the rise is first of all because we're catching it more secondly because we're shortening our attention spans and third because we've actually got a lot of stress on our school system which means that it's harder to accommodate neuroatypical kids next question is why is ADHD more common in males so this is a really good question so we do know that ADHD is more common in males for sure what maturity really is is frontal lobe development and we know that boys frontal lobes tend to develop a little bit slower than girls so boys tend to be a little bit more impulsive they tend to be a little bit more wavering in terms of their attention sometimes they're like a little bit less conscientious especially at early ages and so we do do know that there are some very specific gender effects in terms of how boys are now there's also looser evidence that for example ADHD is a manifestation of dynamic attention and that the male gender is required Dynamic attention from on a more evolutionary aspect so if you think a little bit about there's this hypothesis that isn't really correct I mean I think it's been somewhat debunked about hunters and farmers and these are kind of two personality types or cognitive Styles and in a lot of societies the hunters tend to be men and if you think about what Hunters need to do they need to integrate a lot of stimuli and need to have a very Dynamic attention so there may actually be some kind of selective pressure on the male gender for having a more Dynamic attention and when you have a kid who's got a dynamic attention that was sort of like evolved to be out in the wilderness where they're tracking things and noticing Footprints and noticing broken things over like broken Twigs over there and they're sort of like on the lookout for danger and you stick that kid in a classroom for eight hours there their brain is not really designed for that why is ADHD treated with stimulants so this is a great question it can be kind of paradoxical and I remember before I sort of did my Psychiatry training I was always really confused about using stimulants in kids with ADHD so here was kind of my my understanding which is that okay so if you have a kid who's got add or ADHD their mind is moving really really really fast to begin with they're having a thousand thoughts a second they're also fidgety they move their arms around a lot hands around a lot right they can't sit still and what we also know is that stimulants tend to like ramp people up right so when I drink caffeine in the morning my thoughts start to move faster my mind feels more sluggish before caffeine we also know that you know caffeine and other kinds of stimulants will also lead to things like fidgetness and stuff like that like I remember being a medical student and seeing people who would use cocaine or amphetamine and they'd be like picking at themselves and like itching and like always fidgety and you know they can't sit still so I was super confused because it seemed like stimulants should make ADHD worse right don't we want to like slow people with ADHD down so this is what's really fascinating about stimulants and why we use the ones that we use is because what they actually stimulate is activity in the frontal lobes so the way that stimulants work in ADHD is our our brain has a gas pedal and it has a break and what the stimulants actually stimulate is the break so they actually act in the frontal lobes and then allow the frontal lobes to strengthen the frontal lobes to inhibit other parts of our brain so what we're actually stimulating is our inhibitory circuitry as we stimulate our inhibitory circuitry the ability for our mind to wander reduces our impulsivity reduces even some of our psychomotor activity like the fidgetness will actually go down so or actually stimulating is our breaks or our inhibitory circuitry next one is is ADHD a disability great question so let's start by understanding what a disability is generally speaking the definition that I like to use for a disability is something that makes your ability to participate in life unequitable so if we think about disabilities it's not that this person is good or bad or that they have more value or less value it's that life is structured in a particular way that assumes that human beings have a particular ability to to do things so simple example is Blindness right so our our society is structured in a way that relies on site as being able to function right so we'll have road signs for example we have cars we have traffic lights we have signs that show what's for sale and what isn't so we have all of these visual dependent things that our society kind of functions on and if you can't see then suddenly you're at a huge disadvantage and participating in life because of the way that Society is structured is ADHD a disability I'd say it can be so for some people their ADHD is so severe that some of the assumptions that we have in terms of how life happens people with ADHD are not really able to participate in and there are a lot of simple examples of this like one is that you know people showing up on time so in general our society is designed with things like appointments where you show up at a particular time and like you assume that everyone else shows up at a particular time our society is built with things like deadlines right so there's a lot of like time related stuff that is baked into our society which people with ADHD really really really struggle with now even if it's a disability that doesn't mean that it isn't fixable so we know for example that even if people are blind we have like sort of some audio accessibility options I don't know that you can drive yet but maybe you'll be able to you can certainly walk with a stick we have like crosswalks that will sort of tell you verbally they'll use sound instead of just light to let you know that it's safe to cross so we can start to make accommodations and you can make those kinds of accommodations as well we cover a lot of this stuff by the way in Dr K's guide to ADHD and doing stuff about how you can sort of use organizational tools uh prioritization techniques things like that a lot of things that people with ADHD really struggle with will sort of teach you how to do that and what we've actually found even if you look at cognitive behavioral therapy for ADHD a lot of CBT is sort of like a how to organize and prioritize your life 101 kind of stuff so I think certainly it can sometimes rise to the level of disability because our our society doesn't really accommodate people who have struggles to be on time for example and at the same time just like we can have you know handicap accessible ramps for wheelchairs there's a lot of stuff that you can do to compensate for that disability and actually function within life why is ADHD over diagnosed so in my opinion ADHD is both the most over diagnosed and under-diagnosed illness so why is it over diagnosed so the first thing is that remember that ADHD has an environmental component to it so student teacher ratios will determine the amount of ADHD that gets diagnosed there are some situations in which we'll diagnose it in other situations in which the person actually won't get diagnosed so why are we over diagnosing ADHD a couple of reasons one is that a lot of the symptoms of ADHD are very relatable so if we look at I have difficulty concentrating I can't sit still I sometimes forget things I have difficulty staying organized the symptoms of ADHD are so much of a universal experience that a lot of people will think that they have ADHD because who doesn't have difficulty concentrating I can't sit still in a class for eight hours and have my mind wander so since there are so many symptoms which are actually within the normal range of Human Experience a lot of people will think that they have ADHD the second reason that it gets diagnosed a lot is because if you get diagnosed with ADHD and you don't actually have ADHD it oftentimes works out in your advantage so if I'm a college student and I want to do well in my classes and I have difficulty focusing and even if I don't have ADHD if I can get diagnosed with ADHD and get prescribed a stimulant it will actually make my college life in some ways easier it'll be easier to study it'll be easier to get good grades so part of the reason that I see a lot of people push for a diagnosis is because in some ways getting diagnosed with ADHD especially if you don't have it can lead to advantages so I think the number one reason we miss diagnoses of ADHD is in the case of a high IQ so most of the adults that I've diagnosed with ADHD actually have very high IQ and how do those two things relate well generally speaking the smarter the child is the more they can compensate for the shortcomings of ADHD so they develop all of these adaptations or compensation mechanisms that allow them to essentially continue to get good grades so it's not that I can actually study but I'm just so friggin smart that I don't need to study so sometimes the diagnosis of ADHD stays incredibly silent as people come up with compensatory mechanisms and IQ is at the top of the list is ADHD curable okay so I'm going to say that the answer is yes and no we don't think about psychiatric diagnoses as curable so we think about curable diagnoses as things that can be permanently fixed right so an infection is a good example of an external thing that invades your body and can be sort of like altered there may be other sources of things that can be let's say curable like let's say I do bypass surgery for my heart I have a clogged artery I literally attach a new artery that artery is open fixes the blood flow essentially cures the problem the problem with psychiatric illnesses is that we can't go in and like stick something into your brain that'll fix it and furthermore the psychiatric illnesses that we have especially things like ADHD have to do with the function of our frontal lobes right so it's not like an illness that we can fix it's the way that our neurons are wired so on the one hand it would kind of imply that psychiatric illnesses are not curable on the flip side what we do know is that with effective treatment it's essentially as if you no longer have ADHD so let's go through a couple of things that can quote unquote cure ADHD the first is that frontal lobes develop until you're about the age of 30 or 32. and we do know that somewhere between 10 and 25 percent of people will quote unquote grow out of ADHD and what does that mean so ADHD is a disorder of our basically our frontal lobes and so as our frontal lobes continue to mature some of us are kind of right on the cusp where the ADHD is mild enough that frontal lobe maturation basically gets us across the line and then we can essentially live normal lives but remember that number is pretty small it's like basically 10 to 25 percent so the next really interesting thing is that if you look at Psychotherapy for ADHD versus medication for ADHD what you tend to find is that if you start somewhere on medication or Psychotherapy that the outcomes are about the same so they both help about the same amount the interesting thing is that within six months of stopping medication the symptoms of ADHD will usually return to Baseline but in the case of psychotherapy and this is what's really interesting it takes about two years for the symptoms to start to return which begs the question if there isn't a stimulant in my mind that kind of gets washed out of my system what on Earth why doesn't the ADHD come back within one year shouldn't it come back kind of right away and that's where if we really look at the mechanisms of psychotherapy for ADHD a lot of that stuff is kind of like cognitive training or almost neuronal training or teaching particular skills that compensate for the ADHD like how to develop a to-do list how to stay organized how to set alarms and reminders and the cool thing is that if we can start to implement some of those things it essentially removes the ADHD from the equation personally clinically I've worked with a lot of people who essentially have sustained remission in ADHD like they've been two years out from treatment and are actually doing like totally fine sometimes I'll get a Christmas card from them or they'll call me around the holidays and they'll be like hey Dr K like just wanted to let you know you know Merry Christmas I'll be like how are you or your symptoms back they're like no actually I'm totally fine there do seem to be cases where people can kind of like grow out of it or have a sustainable solution that kind of works for them so even though we don't really know whether ADHD can be curable or not what we do know is that there are definitely things that you can Implement in your life that will basically cancel it out the last thing is that we also know that there are ways to strengthen the frontal lobes so meditation is a good example of something that strengthens the frontal lobes that has more of a let's say permanent effect so if you meditate for a long period of time your frontal lobes will strengthen if you continue to meditate every day they'll be kind of generally stronger but there's some amount of almost permanent effect from it so there are I would say permanent gains to be made with ADHD treatment even if we can't quite call it a cure how can you prevent ADHD what a fascinating question so what I'm going to do now is actually depart a little bit from science so it is my belief that if you isolate the different problems that ADHD has like if you look at the Neuroscience deficiencies let's say impulsivity let's say the inability to do delayed gratification it is my belief and I'm running a trial of sorts on this as we speak that you can actually teach a child particular skills that will compensate for their Neuroscience deficiencies and I'll give you all just a simple example so one example is that people with ADHD have difficulty delaying gratification okay so what that sort of means is that like there's a very famous kind of a test called the marshmallow test where you can offer a child one marshmallow now or two marshmallows in five or ten minutes it's the simple idea that if I make a sacrifice today I can get more tomorrow that people with ADHD really struggle with so normal kids will be able to wait five minutes ten minutes that also has to do to some degree with your personality structure your degree of conscientiousness but ADHD kids are notorious at getting instant gratification and being vulnerable to instant gratification so I was playing a game with someone that I care about deeply recently and I was playing this game with them intentionally and the game is this card game called Jaipur and it's a really lovely board game and a key part of the board game it's a trading game where you accumulate cards but the key thing is that the more cards you sell the more items you sell at one time you get like stackable bonuses so you get sort of like an multiplier on the points that you score depending on you know how long you wait to sell stuff so if I sell one of an item I'll get 1.0 if I sell two of an item I'll get 1.0 if I sell three of an item I'll get 1.2 if I sell four of an item I'll get 1.4 and if I sell five of an item I'll get 1.6 or 1.8 so it's my belief that this game actually trains the brain to learn the skill of delayed gratification that as I was working with this one particular person I started playing the game with them and then originally they would see like a shiny Gem and they'd sell it right away because they wanted the points and over the course of teaching them this game what we've actually learned is that they've started to delay their gratification some and not only if they delay their gratification within the game I've noticed a change in terms of their ability to delay gratification in other parts of their life so I am starting to really believe that you could what you can really do is understand all of the Neuroscience deficits of ADHD and start to actually Target and train those specific skills so if you've got a kid who's kind of on that ADHD path and you take some of these principles from like CBT of ADHD and actually start to teach them to the Child Teach the child to meditate teach the child to be less impulsive you can potentially train some of those skills now is the scientifically valid not really but there's you know this is something that I'm really starting to believe is possible based on this one experiment that I happen to be running okay last question is how can ADHD affect your performance in school the short answer is that ADHD can really mess with your school performance and um you know like I don't want to say this but like basically school is not designed for the ADHD brain school is designed for the neurotypical brain so school is designed under a couple of assumptions one is that students have a certain level of organization second is that students have a certain amount of ability to prioritize students have a certain amount of impulse control so I'll give you all a simple example so let's look at how or the last thing is schools have a certain amount of attentional assumptions on the part of their students so let's tunnel down into that for a second if you think about school school has two ways that we learn right you sit in a class and the teacher talks to you way number one second thing is homework and the idea is that homework is a reinforcement of what you learned in school right so there's this assumption that we teach things in class and those things get reinforced and solidified through homework now that school system is designed on the assumption that when there is a teacher in class who is teaching for 50 minutes that the student will learn something obviously right that's why we have classes but imagine what happens if for example you're a student in that class let's say you're doing a zoom lecture and your internet connection goes out let's say every five minutes your internet connection disappears for five minutes so you only get 50 of what the teacher teaches now what kind of disadvantage do you think that person would have because the disadvantage that they face is greater than just what they missed right because now when they get assigned homework they actually have to teach themselves all of the gaps so whereas homework may cause take a one hour for a regular student for the kid with ADHD not only do they have to go and make up let's say the 30 minutes of class that they've missed out on but they have to like do some amount of catch-up learning an additional 30 minutes to one hour to complete the one hour of homework so whereas one student can accomplish something within two hours one hour of class and one hour of homework the kid with ADHD has to have one hour of homework one hour a half an hour of like patching up class and an additional half an hour of like sort of fixing everything so that they can do the homework so the ADHD kit it costs them three hours instead of two and we're not even considering for a moment that the ADHD kids mind is wandering while they're doing homework which is also the case so now when you really think about it what takes two hours for a neurotypical kid will take four hours for an ADHD kit and why is that it's because the ADHD mind wanders so much in class that half of the class is wasted on them so I think we oftentimes don't really acknowledge or realize how devastating ADHD can be for a child what it essentially means is that you can't participate in school the way that school is designed and so what ADHD kids have to do is work twice as hard or come up with all of these compensatory mechanisms to try to fix what they're missing from school and what's so devastating about this and there's so much research that if you look at kids with ADHD there's a 70 chance that they will develop depression later in life a mood disorder and that's absolutely a causative effect so three percent of kids who have major depressive disorder will grow up to have ADHD but seventy percent of kids who have ADHD will grow up to have major depressive disorder and why is that it's because life is designed for a neurotypical kid and when you go through life as a neuro atypical kid and you don't even know you're neuroatypical all you end up with is man I'm so incompetent what is wrong with me how are these kids able to do this I know I'm just as smart as them but these kids are getting A's and I'm struggling with c's but why does it take them one hour to do homework and it takes me three hours to do homework and outside of an answer or an explanation that is given to those kids they internalize it as shame right because if there's if no one explains it to me what's the most natural conclusion I'm an idiot I'm incompetent I'm lazy I'm undisciplined as they internalize those things it actually manifests depression later in life so hard
