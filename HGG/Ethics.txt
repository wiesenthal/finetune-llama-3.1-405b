hey y'all i'd love to talk a little bit about ethics today there have been several concerns in the community a lot of questions about whether what we do at healthy gamer on stream is therapy whether what we sort of do at healthy gamer as a whole is ethical and i'd love to sort of talk you all through the ethics of what we do the first thing that i kind of want to acknowledge is that most people don't really get an opportunity even in higher education to really understand or learn about medical ethics medical ethics aren't really a matter of philosophy or even opinion so just because i believe what we do is ethical doesn't actually make it ethical if someone else believes what we do is unethical that doesn't actually make it unethical the truth is is that medical ethics are actually very very clearly defined there's there are standards of practice that are actually codified in state federal and international laws and licensing boards are very specific about what is ethical and what is not ethical so ethics aren't really a matter of opinion so what are some of the central principles of medical ethics the first principle is beneficence so this is essentially to try to maximize the good that we do the second principle of medical ethics is non-malfeasance so this is to try to minimize the harm that we do the third principle of ethics is autonomy so this is sort of when doctors we provide information to people but it is ultimately their choice whether they engage in something or not engage in something as a patient you have the right to refuse a treatment right so doctors can't make decisions for you and the fourth major principle of medical ethics is justice and that's where we try to deliver medical services in a fair way so if you kind of think about these principles of medical ethics it kind of like it sort of boils down to a lot of what you see in clinical practice so if i'm trying to prescribe a medication for example the medication is going to have some benefits and it's going to have some side effects so how do i decide whether it's appropriate to prescribe a medication or not so what i do is i'll weigh beneficence against non-malfeasance does the clinical benefit from the medication outweigh the side effects or the harm that it does if the answer is yes then it's sort of a good treatment to recommend i also as a doctor allow people to make their own decisions right so we're seeing a lot of this right now in the world with people refusing vaccination where people are allowed to make their own decisions about coven 19 treatment receiving it not receiving it and that's a central principle of medical ethics the last principle of justice is essentially that we as doctors don't discriminate we try to treat everyone the same and it sort of doesn't matter that you've smoked for 50 years when you get lung cancer we're going to treat you the same as if you've never smoked a single cigarette so these are some of the core principles of medical ethics and what i want to dive into next which is a really really big question in our community is what we do therapy on stream so a lot of people will sort of look at what we do on stream and sort of assume that this is the practice of therapy after all i'm a therapist and i'm talking to someone about their emotions so is that actually therapy and i'd like to start by sort of sharing a little bit of a narrative so when i started healthy gamer the reason that i started healthy gamer is i was working with a lot of people who were sort of of the digital generation and the more gamers that i worked with the more young people i worked with i noticed i was having the same conversation over and over in fact what i noticed was that what was really missing is not clinical treatment these were not people who needed prescriptions or even psychotherapy what they needed first and foremost was education i found myself having the same conversation over and over again teaching the same things over and over again so i started to wonder could i actually help 10 people or a hundred people by having a single conversation online and so as i started to investigate that question even before i started streaming at all the first thing that i looked into is whether it was possible as a psychiatrist to have public conversations with people about their mind and mental health the answer that i discovered was yes you can provided you do it in a very specific way so people may think that what i do on on stream is therapy but the truth is it is actually very clearly not therapy and what do i mean by that let's explore that for a second the first thing to understand is that the practice of psychotherapy is very tightly regulated so i can't just i mean i can because i'm a psychiatrist but you know the average person can't just open up an office and say i'm doing psychotherapy in the same way that someone can't hang up you know open an office and say i'm doing surgery so there are some things a psychotherapy is a very restricted practice and so as a result it's very clearly defined so what constitutes psychotherapy and what doesn't constitute psychotherapy the other thing to understand is that therapists are regulated in all manner of ways so for example if you go see a therapist they are not allowed to divulge anything about you including your name or what's going on with you with anyone else so when you see a therapist you are entitled to doctor-patient confidentiality so we sort of what i discovered as i was looking into whether it's possible for me to have conversations online is that what's actually regulated is not necessarily the practice of therapy i mean it is but that's actually regulated under a broader set of ethical and legal guidelines which is the clinical practice of medicine so why is your therapist entitled why are you entitled to doctor-patient confidentiality with your therapist it's because they're practicing clinical medicine why do we regulate who is allowed to do therapy and who is not allowed to do therapy it's because we regulate the practice of clinical medicine we regulate who can do therapy we regulate who can pull teeth we regulate who can do surgery we regulate who can prescribe medication so all of these regulations are shared right so you have doctor patient confidentiality with dentists with therapists with psychiatrists with surgeons with endocrinologists or obstetricians or gynecologists so the the ethical guidelines and the regulations of what therapy is and what constitutes therapy falls under the broader practice of clinical medicine and this is another really important point because my professional training is as an md so the laws and ethics that i'm held to as a medical doctor sort of involve the practice of clinical medicine so what actually constitutes the practice of medicine so the american psychiatric association defines psychiatry as the branch of medicine that's focused on the diagnosis treatment and prevention of mental and emotion mental emotional and behavioral disorders so clinical medicine is essentially it's it's very specific but clinical medicine is the practice of medicine and the practice of medicine is actually very clearly defined there's a clear line between what is medicine and what is not medicine so for example prescribing medications or doing surgery fall under the practice of medicine psychotherapy falls under the practice of medicine and while the practices of medicine may vary a little bit from state to state each state has its own guidelines each country has its own guidelines there are three incredibly common and conserved things no matter where you look at the practice of medicine those three things are first of all the formation of a doctor-patient relationship the second is diagnosis and the third is treatment so wherever you go medicine constitutes these three things so let's start with the first one the commencement of a doctor-patient relationship so i know this sounds kind of weird and it may sound kind of simple but this is actually very very clearly defined so the ama actually clearly defines what what constitutes entering into a doctor-patient relationship and the key thing here is that there's a voluntary agreement by both parties that we are entering into a doctor-patient relationship this may sound a little bit weird like but just think about it kind of logically right so you can't walk up to me or any other doctor and say hey you're my doctor now similarly i as a doctor cannot walk up to a random person on the street and say hey i'm your doctor now the patient has to agree to be a patient and the doctor has to agree to be their doctor the american medical association also clearly defines the exceptions to this rule so one exception for example is emergency care or the case of a surrogate so if someone is in a car accident and they have a skull fracture or not conscious they do not have to agree to be a patient a doctor can actually start administering medical care in the case of an emergency surrogates are other examples so if you have something like a six month old child the child can't enter into a doctor-patient relationship if you have someone who's 85 years old and has dementia they may not be able to enter into a doctor-patient relationship so a surrogate can enter into the relationship for you the other major success exception to entry into a doctor-patient relationship is a limited um doctor-patient relationship in the case of like a consultation or temporary medical care so i'll give you all just a simple example of this so let's say i go on vacation so i have my patients that i'm responsible for i have a doctor who's covering for me but that doctor is only responsible for those patients while i'm on vacation and once i come back that person's limited relationship with patients ends so those all of my patients can't sort of automatically switch over to the new doctor without that doctor's consent there are other cases where there are limited doctor-patient relationships those tend to be informal consultations so sometimes for example if you've got cancer you may seek a second opinion from a different doctor and you still have your primary doctor but you're allowed to engage in a limited doctor-patient relationship with a separate doctor is part of a consultation the key thing here is that a doctor-patient relationship is very clearly defined it's a voluntary commitment by both parties the other key thing is that the exceptions to the doctor-patient relationship are also clearly defined there are two major exceptions which we just talked about and those are the only ones talking to a psychiatrist online is not an exception to the voluntary entry of a doctor-patient relationship the other things in addition to the voluntary consensual entry into a doctor-patient relationship are diagnosis and treatment these are the other two pillars of the practice of medicine so what constitutes diagnosis and what constitutes treatment this is where standard of care enters the picture so we all recognize that you know diagnosis and treatment are not the same for any given illness so the diagnosis and treatment of cancer may be different from diagnosis and treatment of let's say a physical thera like a muscle strain which may be different from let's say diagnosing depression so there are individual standards of care depending on what kind of medicine you're practicing and the reason that we use standard of care is to sort of regulate and help all doctors and patients understand what is the responsibility of a doctor in order to be saying i am practicing medicine what are the things that i'm required to do when a patient comes to a doctor and wants to receive medical care what is the standard of care that they should provide so understanding this is also really useful if we kind of like use an analogy so let's say i go and order a pizza what constitutes a pizza is it just someone saying hey this is a pizza no so we think of a pizza as like a couple of core things right so there's some kind of like bread or pizza dough right there's some kind of sauce and there's some kind of cheese so the way that we define pizza is based on these three requirements right it's got to have bread it's got to have sauce it's got to have cheese now i recognize that there may be some different definitions of pizza i'm just sort of using that as an analogy and if we look at the practice of clinical medicine across state lines across different countries it sort of constitutes three things the entry of a doctor-patient relationship diagnosis and treatment so then the question becomes what constitutes diagnosis what's the standard of care of diagnosis if i want to diagnose someone does that just mean like going up to a mental health professional and they just say i think you have depression therefore you have depression actually not at all so there are very very strict standards of diagnosis so i'll give you guys sort of a quick overview of what i do in my clinical practice and basically what other therapists should be doing as well because it's the standard of care so the diagnostic process involves a lot of different stuff so it involves taking a history of present illness which includes like a symptom assessment so what are the things that you're experiencing it includes things like duration frequency severity of symptoms so how long have you been experiencing this you know how often does it happen how bad is it what what are the character of the symptoms you experience in addition to the hpi we also assess medical history so do you have any other medical conditions have you had any other psychiatric conditions have you ever been hospitalized have you ever had surgery before so there are lots of different things that you collect for the medical history the next thing that we sort of collect is we'll collect things like substance use history so do you use substances we'll ask questions about your social history so where do you live what do you do are you sexually active what are your relationships like is there any chance you have an sti and yes i do ask each and every one of my patients whether they're 13 years old or 85 years old about their sexual history because it's standard of care for physicians other things include family history so has anyone in your family ever been hospitalized does anyone in your family have medical conditions and you all may sort of recognize this kind of stuff because if you go to a doctor's office they're going to give you a bunch of forms that you fill out and we don't ask any of those questions on stream right so people may volunteer some information kind of from a narrative perspective about what their upbringing was like but we do not do diagnostic assessments on stream other parts of the diagnostic assessment include laboratory testing and imaging sometimes i'll order mris of the brain sometimes i'll order lab tests so the process of diagnosis is actually very very specific it's not something that it's not just like you ask a couple of questions and then you sort of suddenly have a diagnosis the other thing to consider about the diagnostic process which is standard of care is also a differential diagnosis so it is actually not enough for me to ask all of those questions as a doctor the practice of medicine constitutes developing a differential diagnosis so if someone comes in with symptoms of depression i also have to assess them for bipolar disorder i also have to assess them for schizoaffective disorder i also have to assess them for a substance-induced mood disorder which in the practice of medicine we absolutely do so what i'm going to do for just to show y'all is take a quick look at the diagnostic criteria for major depressive disorder so as we can see the interview should establish the presence of depressive symptoms depressed mood most of the day loss of interest or pleasure in most or all activities insomnia hypersomnia significant weight loss or weight gain psychomotor retardation or agitation fatigue or low energy decreased ability to concentrate think or make decisions thoughts of worthlessness or excessive or inappropriate guilt recurrent thoughts of death or suicidal ideation or a suicide attempt depressed mood that occurs most of the day more days than not and is persistent and lasts for at least two weeks we also have to go on so that it just keeps going right so we have to determine the chronology of the current depressive symptoms any prior history of depressive episodes determine the impact of the depressive episode elicit alleviating and aggravating factors and address comorbidities include questions about a past history of mania or hypomania so this is this is actually the standard that we're talking about and like i don't know how else to say this but we don't do that on stream because that's what constitutes the practice of medicine remember once again if we're doing therapy on stream then we have to adhere to the standards of therapy how do we define therapy it's part of the practice of medicine what is the practice of medicine these are the standards of care in terms of diagnosing someone with major depressive disorder and the simple fact is that we don't do any of that right i don't do thorough symptomatic assessments i don't assess frequency severity duration some of these things may come up in the course of stream but that is not actually constituting a diagnosis the next thing that i want to point out is for people who think okay we are do i diagnose things on stream i don't and so let me actually show you so someone talking about their depression does not actually constitute diagnosis here are what actual diagnoses are so this is from the icd-11 so this is the international classification of disease so this is an international consensus about what constitutes diagnosis so when i'm seeing a patient in my office i will actually diagnose them with one of these things recurrent depressive disorder current episode mild or current episode moderate without psychotic symptoms with psychotic symptoms severe with psychotic symptoms impartial remission in fuller remission these are actual diagnoses we do not tell people on stream that they have these we do not ask diagnostic questions to the extent of what is necessary for major depressive disorder so depression is not a diagnosis anxiety is not a diagnosis anxiety is an emotion the actual diagnoses are things like generalized anxiety disorder socializing anxiety disorder anxiety disorder induced by a substance unspecified anxiety disorder those are actually diagnoses and we do not assign those labels to anyone on stream what about treatment so treatment is also something where it involves a standard of care so the standard of care for psychotherapy because a lot of people are wondering whether i do something what i do on stream is psychotherapy or not let's talk about what constitutes the standard of care of psychotherapy so when a therapist is working with a patient what do we expect from them what can patients expect and what are patients sorry what a therapist's responsible for delivering so a good example of the foundation of a psychotherapeutic treatment is something called a treatment plan so this is a treatment plan that i just kind of wrote up it's a fake treatment plan these are the kinds of treatment plans that i develop for my patients so you know they'll have the name date of birth things like that but then it'll have the first diagnosis and so this is actually what i do in clinical practice treatment plans include things like psychopharmacology are they taking medicine are we doing some kind of evidence-based psychotherapy what are the goals of the psychotherapy what other kinds of things are we doing for health and wellness so for example sometimes as part of treatment plans i'll include mindfulness practice what's the second diagnosis what's the state of the second diagnosis what are we doing for it okay this person had an alcohol problem but i'm currently not prescribing anything by the way they've benefited from naltrexone in the past psychotherapy can also there can also be psychotherapy for the second diagnosis and the part of the treatment plan is to go to alcoholics anonymous the third thing the third diagnosis is going to be ptsd for this person so there's medications i'm prescribing but they're also seeing a different therapist for doing a different evidence-based treatment modality there's also different kinds of peer support and there's a medical diagnosis thrown in so this is an example of what an actual treatment plan is like when you perform therapy with a patient this is what therapy actually looks like i'll show you just another sort of generic example of what a treatment plan this is just something i found on the internet but once again this this diagnostic system is kind of a little bit outdated so this is from dsm4 so we've kind of updated this but the key thing here is once again there are clear there's a principal diagnosis there's a diagnosis that's assigned um there's a duration of diagnosis there are functional deficits that are mentioned what are the issues what's issue number one what's goal number one what's objective number one what's task number one what's task number two what's area number two what's issue number two what's goal number two this is what constitutes an actual treatment plan so when you perform therapy on someone you're doing all of this stuff right so this kind of comes down to like do we do therapy on stream and the answer is absolutely not and the reason we're able to say that is because therapy is actually very very tightly regulated right it's not a matter of opinion it's just because dr k believes we're not doing therapy doesn't mean that we're not doing therapy when we set out we design stream with these considerations in mind so when i thought about okay what am i allowed to do on stream what is ethically and legally appropriate to do on stream the main conclusion is i'm not allowed to practice medicine on stream even then there may be some theoretical situations in which that's possible but generally speaking that's the main dividing line so everything we do on stream is not the practice of clinical medicine in order to sort of figure out what is okay on stream we can define what the practice of clinical medicine is or understand the definition so that's not something we define that's something that we exhaustively looked up by looking through you know hundreds of pages of medical ethics documents state laws federal laws regulations licensing board things ethics uh you know sort of opinions on ethics from the american medical association the american psychiatric association and what we sort of decided to do on stream is actually clearly outside of those things the other simple gut check that i have for you all is when you go to a doctor's office how similar is it to what happens on stream and the short answer is like not at all right because doctors are practicing clinical medicine and what we're doing on stream is having conversations about mental health we do not enter into a doctor-patient relationship we do not diagnose people with medical illnesses and we do not treat them for medical illnesses psychotherapy is governed and regulated and the ethical standards around psychotherapists are under the broader umbrella of clinical practice right so you are not allowed to engage in a romantic relationship with your doctor you're not allowed to engage in a romantic relationship with your psychotherapist you are not allowed to as a therapist violate your patient's privacy the legal protections that we have constitute protections from a doctor-patient relationship and we don't enter into that we don't diagnose people and we don't treat people so then the next question very naturally is why do people think that what we do on stream is therapy right so where does this idea come from what do we actually do on stream and are there any overlaps with therapy so it's a really good question because i don't think most people like we sort of mentioned most people haven't studied medical ethics they don't really understand the definition of the practice of medicine they're not trained in diagnosis they're not trained in developing treatment plans or doing psychotherapy so where to get they get this idea that what we do on stream is therapy so it's a really good question so what we do on stream is we have conversations with people that are about their mental health and i use some skills so i'm a very good listener for example i'm very good at asking questions i'm very knowledgeable about things so i'll build some amount of an alliance with the person that i'm talking to i'll be a very active listener and i'll ask very insightful questions so sometimes people think that that constitutes therapy whereas no that doesn't constitute therapy so i'll just think about this for a second there are other professions outside of therapists that do these things so who builds an alliance very quickly with the person that they're talking to who makes very empathic statements and tries to help people open up fbi hostage negotiators right even customer service representatives if you've been on a customer service talked to a customer service representative recently you may have noticed that they do some of the skills that are generally speaking what we think of from therapy right they'll ask they'll make like very empathic statements oh i'm so sorry that you had to go through that so this is like really important to understand but just because i'm a very good listener and just because i'm very good at like asking questions and making observations and reading body language that is not what actually constitutes therapy in fact these are skills that are used by all kinds of people so executives for example will get like interpersonal training and training in relationships and communication so these are skills like communication skills between people are things that i absolutely do on stream but i don't do anything medical on stream and oftentimes because people don't recognize or understand what constitutes the practice of clinical medicine which isn't really a problem because you're not going to learn that unless you go to medical school or you engage in some other kind of clinical education you know it can look like what you imagine therapy is because what do you imagine therapy is it's like what you see based on media and tv shows and stuff like that whereas the truth is that the practice of clinical medicine is completely different so there may be like even though i've sort of made a very strong case and like i said we sort of set stream up to be outside the bounds of the practice of clinical medicine and therapy there's still maybe some kind of confusion there so like what if you kind of make the argument for example that even though i'm a medical doctor and i'm not entering into a doctor-patient relationship i'm not diagnosing anyone with anything and i'm not providing treatment plans right so i'm not doing psychotherapy i'm not um you know providing medications or anything like that i'm still a medical professional who is like listening empathically which sometimes is done in therapy so therapists are absolutely empathic listeners so if i'm a medical doctor am i allowed to empathically listen to someone and ask someone insightful questions or is that something that i'm no longer allowed to do except with my patients and that's kind of like absurd because the answer is clearly i'm allowed to do that with people without entering into a doctor-patient relationship so for example i do that with my kids i do that with my wife i do that with my friends i when when human beings talk to me i try to be an empathic active listener when human beings talk to me i try to ask insightful questions to help them out if a friend of mine is going through a breakup i'm going to sort of you know listen to them very carefully i'm going to sort of maybe even get emotional with them we'll sort of have a good cry together and then i may sort of ask some questions or volunteer some information or teach them how to meditate just because something happens within a therapeutic relationship does not mean that it is therapy when it happens outside of a therapeutic relationship so just to kind of reiterate that like if you really think about it like if that were true if i weren't allowed to have emotional conversations with other people like i couldn't interact with other human beings in an empathic way and this is what's sort of brilliant about the way that clinical medicine is defined because it's defined about what's the goal right is it diagnosis or treatment if yes then it's clinical medicine if no then it's not clinical medicine so there are other things besides communication skills which can be you know taught as part of clinical medicine or used as part of clinical medicine but aren't technically clinical medicine so i'll give you all a couple of examples so as a physical therapist if you're a good physical therapist you'll teach your patients to stretch does that mean that stretching is a part of physical therapy sort of but is it exclusive to physical therapy no so if you go to a personal trainer who's a non-clinical person they're allowed to teach people how to stretch as well then the next question kind of becomes is a physical therapist allowed to teach people who are not their patients how to stretch absolutely right so if i'm a physical therapist and on weekends i like have a crossfit group and at the very beginning of the crossfit group i teach people how to stretch even though it's a part of my clinical practice that i engage in it it's not exclusively a clinical activity so i'm allowed to do it with random people if i want to another good example of this is meditation so meditation is something that's been shown to have a clinical benefit so as a doctor i will teach meditation to my patients does that mean that if i teach meditation to someone outside of my doctor-patient relationship that i am their doctor or practicing medicine absolutely not one of my mentors what is a zen priest and they teach their patients how to meditate and on the weekends they go to the zen temple and they teach students how to meditate that does not mean just because something can exist within therapy does not mean that doing that thing outside of therapy like listening well being a decent human being and asking good questions makes it the practice of therapy the last thing that i'll say is that this is also very clearly defined so in the practice of clinical medicine there are some things that are exclusively clinical medicine and those are very tightly regulated and i am not actually allowed to do those things outside of a doctor-patient relationship so the simple example is like prescribed controlled medication so prescribing medication is exclusive to the practice of clinical medic medicine so i can't prescribe adderall or opiates to my wife that is actually considered unethical i cannot do particular things i cannot treat diagnose or treat my wife i cannot diagnose or treat my friend in fact that is a very very important ethical boundary which we respect at hg once we have a relationship with someone that is a non-clinical relationship we don't cross that line so this is really really important to understand because there are some things that therapists may do but those are not exclusively the practice of medicine and even as a medical provider i'm allowed to do those things with like ordinary people without it being the practice of medicine right so just like the physical therapist who can teach someone to stretch just because it's a part of their clinical practice doesn't make it exclusively clinical practice and there are clear lines about what's exclusively the practice of clinical medicine and we don't do those things with anyone on stream so the next thing that i want to talk a little bit about is the actual stream process so how does someone come on stream what are the protections that we use what are the standards that we hold to and so this is where there's another really important part that i want to talk about which is kind of an ethical standard that we hold ourselves to which is informed consent so before people come on stream we they they meet with a producer and the producer sort of lays out with them what stream is what's allowed what's not allowed we make it very clear to them that this is not the practice of medicine that dr k is not your doctor and we make sure that they agree to that so we go through an informed consent process so if there's any confusion there or they're looking for some kind of medical advice that's where things end right so we inform them and then we go through the consent process and this is where the ethical principle of autonomy comes up so we at hg believe that a human being an adult who wants to come onto the internet and voluntarily talk voluntarily talk to someone about their mental health should be able to we believe that human beings should have the autonomy to make their own decisions so out of respect of that autonomy we want to make things very crystal clear so we like you know have conversations with them we also give them the opportunities to set boundaries on anything that they don't want to talk about so this is not something where like once they come on stream they're also allowed to set boundaries in the middle of stream if they want to but they're allowed to say hey i don't want to talk about this on stream i don't want to mention this on stream i don't want to mention this on stream so what we essentially do is go through a rigorous informed consent process where we explain very clearly this is not a doctor-patient relationship and we make sure that they're on the same page if there's any confusion there we either resolve that confusion or we sort of stop right because we are not going to practice clinical medicine on stream so here at hg we actually hold ourselves to a very high ethical standard despite the fact that we are not engaging in clinical activity so on stream i don't practice therapy because it's very clearly defined right so remember that therapy is part of the subset of the practice of clinical medicine which is why you would get doctor patient privileges you know you there are ethical guidelines around your therapist et cetera et cetera and remember that the practice of clinical medicine is clearly defined as having three components the bread is entry into the doctor-patient relationship that's how it starts the sauce is diagnosis and the cheese is treatment and since we do none of those things we're not practicing clinical medicine and we're not doing psychotherapy with people on stream at the same time we hold ourselves to a couple of really high standards so the first example that i'll give y'all and this is in many dimensions of our our company and our work but the first is research so for example for all of our research studies we submit them to something called an independent review board or an irb so there's a third party organization which is not affiliated with us at all and when we want to do research we'll take our research study and we'll pass it to the irb and we'll say hey we would like to do this research on human subjects will you please evaluate it and tell us if it is in line in alignment with ethical principles and the irb is essentially the they were developed kind of after people did predatory research on on human subjects and so that we've actually had five independent reviews of our research in a sixth that's ongoing for another study that we're doing that have all sort of met an independently reviewed ethical criteria so we got the green light from an institutional review board which is a third-party kind of ethical organization that approves the research that we do so the other thing that we hold ourselves to a high standard to is being responsive to feedback so here at hg we're sort of in new territory right mental health is rapidly evolving the needs of this generation in terms of taking care of their mental health are rapidly evolving the solutions that we need to use are rapidly evolving a hundred years ago no one was meditating for the sake of their mental health but now we have these new tools we have these new challenges like social media and online toxicity and so as we sort of adapt to these new circumstances we don't have all the answers at hg because no one has all the answers these problems are new so a big thing that we sort of very very carefully focus on is taking feedback and this is something that we actually pride ourselves in hg has gotten to where we are today because of the feedback from our community so i'll give you all just one simple example of this in the past i'd talked a fair amount about ayurveda generally speaking when i talk about ayurveda i talk about it more from a personality analysis standpoint and as part of the support for ayurveda i cited a couple of scientific papers seven months ago someone in our community made a post sort of questioning the veracity of the research that we were citing and it turns out that they made really really good arguments so we talked about it on stream addressed their criticism turns out that a lot of their criticisms were actually really good and for the last seven months we haven't said a word about ayurveda internally we're going through the process of reviewing a whole body of ayurvedic research my point here is that sometimes at hg we'll say particular things that we believe are correct and we'll even go do some research and we'll cite papers and stuff like that but no scientific paper is perfect and as members from our community will point out those kinds of things we will absolutely adjust our behavior so one of the things that we really value and hold ourselves to a very high standard about is actually accepting feedback from our community which is really really helpful and is actually really responsible for the impact that we've been able to achieve the last thing that i want to mention is that the work that we do at hg is not in a vacuum so like i sort of mentioned before we even showed up on stream we did a ton of research about what actually constitutes therapy what actually constitutes the practice of medicine and based on our research that is how we decide what to do as a simple example the world health organization in 2020 released a report which sort of emphasized that mental health is in crisis and one of the key interventions that they said is they said people need to be doing more peer support that clinicians are sort of insufficient and we can't train them fast enough to meet the demands of what mental health needs are so peer support is non-clinical intervention that supports mental health and so it's because of calls like that that we've developed community support programs it's because of calls like that that we've even developed our coaching program so here at hg what we're doing is not just like what we think is a good idea but we regularly and consistently since before we even showed up on stream for the first time have been consulting with industry professionals psychiatrists professional organizations talking to people for example like on on the council of addictions talking to people at the world health organization we even recently had a collaboration with the united nations so what we do at hg and this is a standard that we hold ourselves to we recognize that we don't have all the answers we recognize that like this is a new problem and that the best way to to sort of tackle this problem in sort of a responsible way in an ethical way is to continually engage in dialogue with other professional organizations so that's what we've done from the get-go the next thing that i want to talk a little bit about is something that's a little bit more negative and that's hate farming so there's been an increasing and disturbing trend on the internet recently of people sort of being increasingly critical and essentially farming hate and i want to talk a little bit about what we've learned sort of in terms of our platform and sort of the the reach that we have and how we try to behave in an ethical manner so as a content creator you know i feel like i have a duty to use my platform for good the unfortunate thing is that there are some people out there who will use platforms essentially for negative reasons so they'll hate farm or criticize or things like that and like i've said we're actually completely open to criticism assuming that it's sort of fair and based in fact and is well cited so we're completely open to criticism and quite responsive to criticism like that unfortunately what we're seeing on the internet is an increasing amount of like toxicity right like we can all feel that the internet is becoming a more toxic place and so what i'd like to do today is talk a little bit about how i've come to understand hate farming and sort of what goes into it so the first thing to understand is that hate farmers usually are operating on an emotional level and the main emotion that they sort of target is a vague sense of righteousness so when you watch a video by a hate farmer what you'll often find is that it's very emotional in nature right so it's going to have very powerful imagery it may have sort of a very strong title may have sort of a very powerful thumbnail and as they sort of con as they start to weave their narrative like what you're going to be feeling is some sense of outrage or irateness or things like that and the more that that hate farmers kind of engage your emotions right because that's what it's about it's about making you angry it's about making you grab your pitchfork let's all grab our pitchforks and down with the bad guys that's where the emotions that they engage what they're sort of doing by doing that is sort of ignoring any kind of like you know real criticism so oftentimes there are different kinds of critical videos on the internet some are very well sourced well cited kind of offer balanced perspectives and hate farmers usually won't have that right so they'll usually have some kind of narrative where they sort of will find a bunch of information on the internet and this is where like it's challenging as a content creator because you know we've probably streamed for well over a thousand hours and if you go through all of the the content that we've done you can stitch together basically whatever kind of narrative you want to so a really good example of this if you all haven't seen it is dr k interviews dr k which is when someone takes clips of me and like stitches them together as if i'm having a conversation so you can sort of clip things into context to weave whatever kind of narrative you want to so the first thing to understand about hate farmers is that they work primarily on an emotional level and will really sort of encourage you to get your pitch focus out they may make some kind of narrative argument which sounds very logical at the time but this is where oftentimes what hate farmers do was will come up with a priori arguments and what does that mean and that means that the judgment actually precedes the collection of evidence so i'll go into a little bit more detail there so oftentimes if you look at people who are critical and people who are hate farmers they sort of assume guilt at the very beginning right so they they haven't really done an objective investigation something has happened and they've sort of decided that you're guilty and then something really tricky happens is that once they've decided your guilt they'll start collecting information the problem is that on the internet search and the way that you collect information is going to probably reinforce your biases so i'll give you a simple example of this if i believe that the earth is flat and i let's say do a google search for you know evidence that the earth is not round what i'm going to find is a bunch of evidence that actually already supports my conclusion so you'll even see this with particular hate farmers well they'll do things like they'll tweet out or they'll make public calls stating a particular direction so they'll say like i'm going to make a video about x y or z and how let's say this person is taking advantage of people and so what kind of response do you think that person is going to get when i put a call out on twitter or when i do a google search in a particular direction is covet a hoax what kind of response do you think i'm going to get if i tweet out about saying hey i'm doing a video about you know unreported side effects and bad consequences of getting covet 19 vaccinations what kind of information do you think that person is going to receive so what hate farmers do is they come up with a conclusion and then they start collecting evidence right and i'm not so sure that they're doing this like insidiously on and on purpose is it harmful absolutely but i think that they sort of stumble upon some idea and then it actually shapes the questions that they ask and once you shape the questions that you ask you're going to shape the responses that you get and this is precisely why if we look at a scientific standard of how to collect information making twitter posts is like not a good way to collect information so as if you submit a study to the irb that has a loaded question in it the irb the institutional review board will say this is a bad question you cannot ask this question because it is it is biased by its nature so we this is where in scientific research like we understand this stuff really well when we formulate questions when you ask a research question it has to be approved by someone who sort of makes sure that it isn't biased but when it comes to hate farmers like they don't go to independent review boards to see if their question is biased in some way and so then what happens is you create a selection bias for information right so if i make a post let's say i tweet something out and i tweet out that all men are i'm making a video about it message me if you have any information about this i'm gonna get a volume of response that agrees with what i say the second thing is you could do the opposite you could say all women are  and i'll get the same thing right so i'll get a bunch of people who hate women who kind of respond to me and this is the tricky thing is that oftentimes what hate farmers will do is that based on that response they'll filter it right so this is where a cognitive bias uh kind of steps in where even if you call for a particular kind of information you're going to get the majority of what you're looking for anyway because it's the internet and there's like an infinite amount of opinions you'll also sort of occasionally find people like experts and so this is really important to understand a collection like stringing together a group of expert opinions does not actually constitute evidence so let's remember that tobacco industries were able to find dozens of physicians who under oath swore that cigarettes did not cause lung cancer let's remember that there are anti-covered information dissemination platforms out there that find medical doctors who say that vaccination is a mistake stringing together a couple of experts which is what hate farmers will do right so they'll give you the appearance of evidence and the way that they'll do that is find a couple of credentialed people who agree with them but they're not going to include people in the video who disagree with them right that's just not part of the narrative that they weave and so what ends up happening in that the tools that hate farmers use is they'll sort of start with kind of some click-baity stuff right and then they'll engage your emotions and then they'll based on their selection bias will collect a bunch of information and then they'll string that information together and it sort of makes sense right because if i make a if i ask a video if i make a tweet about oh i'm you know trying to figure out why the moon landing was was a hoax and i'll get 50 people to respond to me and then when i make a video about it i'll take the 10 strongest people and i'll stitch them together and now what i've done over a one hour youtube video as i've made a very strong case for a particular thing but this is why i remind you that especially when it comes to some of the criticism that we've faced it's not a matter of opinion it's a matter of law right these things are very clearly designated and we are in compliance with these kinds of things so when it comes to hate farming be a little bit careful about this stuff right because this is happening more and more on the internet and i oddly enough i don't even necessarily blame these people because i don't know that the people who make hateful videos have done any kind of training with like how to formulate a good non-biased research question that's something that you know i learned through four years of getting a master's in public health in some amount of like as an md you generally see speaking formulating research questions is actually like a very technical and difficult thing to do so i think what's happening is people will sort of come to an a priory conclusion they already decide that something is bad and then they'll sort of ask questions in a way that reinforces their bias this is why the internet is turning into echo chambers and this is what's leading to toxicity the last thing that i want to talk a little bit about is that unfortunately recently we've been the recipient of some hate farming this is kind of hit kind of close to home and one of the things that really bothers me about this these hate farmers is is not necessarily the personal attacks but their decision to include reckful in these videos and what actually really kind of pisses me off to be honest is not even that they included reckful but the picture that they paint of him what really bothers me is that in order to attack me what they've managed to do is they spin this narrative about reckful as like someone who is like easily manipulated and like couldn't kind of think for himself and stuff like that and that's actually what bothers me the most is that in order to attack me they're actually like portraying a picture of byron that is completely inaccurate if you knew byron which i did and he was a very close friend of mine like the dude was brilliant right like he was incredibly independent he was fierce with his views he was fierce with like you know advocating for himself he was strong he was a force to be reckoned with and he was an absolute hero of the internet and so what really bothers me the most is like the way that they're portraying him is like some kind of like you know weak victim like byron was an absolute beast right reckful gladiator was an absolute beast on stream he brought so many people together how was he able to do that it's because he was so damn smart and he was so critical with his thinking and he was so open about his struggles right he inspired so many people to get mental health treatment and what sort of bothers me the most is that in all of this discussion of byron no one is sort of talking about what byron did for us right because the truth is he did a ton for us and i don't just mean me i don't mean hg what i mean is like the internet the twitch community the gaming community and so this is where i want to talk a little bit about sort of ending things almost on a personal note because like the way that our relationship has been misconstrued is very like hurtful and the truth of the matter is that byron and i never entered into a doctor-patient relationship right we were friends we were professional we were professional colleagues we were both streamers that's the nature of our relationship and one of the things that i've really come to appreciate is that as a professional streamer i have a responsibility as a content creator and what we try to do at hg is use our platform for good and the term aoe healing actually came from byron he was the first person who said it sounds like what y'all are doing is aoe healing and that's what we're really about because the world health organization the us surgeon general the united nations and all y'all out there already know that mental health is in crisis that clinical medicine cannot keep up with the rate of like what we're dealing with that some of the challenges that we face in mental health are even not clinical in nature finding purpose in life developing confidence learning how to form healthy relationships learning how to meditate there is a lot more to mental health than mental illness and that is what we want to use our platform for that is why we're incredibly grateful to byron for the contributions that he made and like the way that he helped us do that we're also incredibly grateful to our community for supporting us in this mission and the reason that i did this because i am a medical doctor and i walked away from the majority of clinical practice is because what i saw at home in my office was the same problem over and over and over again and more requests than i could possibly deal with hundreds of thousands or thousands of people reaching out to me asking me for help and there's no way that i can get to them so as a content creator and this is for all the other content creators out there i encourage you all to think very carefully about how can we use this platform because there is so much toxicity on the internet there is so much hate farming going on people are forming echo chambers misogyny and misandry are at all times high people hate men on a level that they never have before people hate women on a level that they never have before the amount of hatred on the internet is reaching epidemic proportions social media is wreaking havoc on our mental health we have a generation of people who can't leave their house because of gaming and watching youtube and all this kind of stuff and so at the end of the day as content creators we have a responsibility to use the tools of the internet to make the world a better place and that's what we're here to do at hg the thing is we cannot do it alone and this is exactly why we need your help your participation your feedback to help us in this mission because there's no way that we can fix this problem on our own we're going to do our level best to try we're going to do it in as ethical and responsible of a manner as we can possibly do it we've adhered to state guidelines federal guidelines standards of practice from the american psychiatric association the american medical association and we're going to continue to do the work that we need to do and i'm asking all of y'all for help in terms of doing this right so whether it's meditating for yourself or being compassionate towards someone else trying to understand someone else's problems not jumping to judgment not giving into toxicity the only way we can fix mental health and the problems that the world faces is together so it comes down to aoe healing and thank you very much for watching the video and participating in what we're doing
