so this is important to understand why do human beings experience negative emotions it's because they're actually very powerful motivators they tend to be the strongest and easiest motivators but they're kind of like dirty motivators they're like burning unclean fuel i keep rewarding my brain by daydreaming about my end goal without actually working towards it i have this issue where i keep relying on external motivation as fuel to propel me forward fantasies of grandiosity where i'm infinitely better than the person who rejected me romantically and making them realize what they lost or proving my worth to people who took me for granted righteous justice i know this sounds like covert narcissism not so covert i might as well be one non-diagnosed i wouldn't jump that far so we all have you know ego defense mechanisms so we all that's just a normal part of the human mind i i think what's fundamentally flawed within my mind is the belief that no one could ever love or appreciate me if i'm not interesting enough the general advice is to just focus on self-improvement and somehow that's going to meet all of my emotional needs i tried to set deadlines for my goals but sadly now i feel only anxious because i'm not putting in the work and as a result i return to escapist behavior which includes daydreaming at the end i find myself stuck in a loop where i have a goal in mind i work on my goal for one day it starts to feel overwhelming because i'm super depressed and no one wants to give me attention i revert back to escapism and fantasize about the life i i'll never have due to my laziness then i resent myself for not putting in effort and compare myself to other people's achievement which acts like a catalyst and motivates me for another day or two i know dr k has talked about daydreaming i'm aware of it now but i have yet to find a solution to my problem how do i stop worrying too much about how uninteresting i come across and just focus on my hobbies that i once enjoyed regardless of the outcome so this is kind of a really good post because this is a case of someone who's done some of the work right so most of us when we struggle with a problem we're not starting from zero we sort of recognize a couple of things we recognize for example that daydreaming is maladaptive we recognize that there are certain techniques we can use for example like set goals for yourself and sort of focus on those goals we also have learned as a community to introspect some right so this person has also done some introspective work and realized oh i have this like fundamental flaw within my mind that no one will appreciate me or love me unless i'm interested enough so we've started to do some work as a community which is awesome at the same time this can be like really challenging because learning some of these nuggets doesn't fix your problem right so like this is the basic problem with like daydreaming which is that okay i feel bad about myself i daydream in some sort of grandiose way that sort of makes me feel like righteous and good right like it makes me feel like emotionally good the problem is that like then i don't actually change my life because i'm stuck in this dream and then like time goes by and then a day has gone by and i haven't actually moved forward and then i start beating myself up right i start to feel resentful for myself instead of actually doing anything about my problems i'm just dreaming about fixing my problems and sometimes that resentment some kind of negative emotion can even spur some kind of action right so for a day or two i get so frustrated with myself that i channel that frustration i use it as fuel to propel me forward for a day or two and i work i'm tired of this never again but then that emotion fizzles and my motivation fizzles with it and then i feel bad about myself and then i daydream and then the cycle repeats so how do we break out of this okay like this is what we have to figure out so we're gonna do is is sort of give you all three very concrete steps about how to break out of this cycle of daydreaming setting a goal sort of moving towards the goal sort of getting frustrated with yourself about moving towards the goal not it not being enough scrapping the goal being resentful beating yourself up like how do we break out of this cycle so we're going to tackle this in three different ways and the key thing is that the third thing that we're going to talk about i think is something that's grossly grossly misunderstood or missed so a lot of us have awareness that okay there's like some kind of negative emotion here i need to deal with the negative emotion i've yet to find a solution how do i stop worrying about how to become uninteresting right so we'll sort of figure out okay how do i stop worrying so much and how do i just act how do i focus on my hobbies regardless of the outcome we know that we need to do those things but we don't really know how and it turns out that we tend to miss one really really really crucial step of this process oftentimes okay so let's try to understand the cycle and the process that goes with it okay so first thing to consider let's start by understanding kind of scientifically the cycle of the daydream so i feel bad about myself i have negative emotion and then i daydream and what happens to my emotional state after i daydream it becomes positive emotion right because now it's like grandiose i feel good about myself there i am kind of like laying in bed at night grinning to myself i'll show them one day you know all these people all realize this okay so it's kind of interesting the first thing to understand is that daydreaming is actually like a coping mechanism it's an emotional coping mechanism so the tricky thing here is that when we want to stop worrying too much our brain is like oh your goal is to stop worrying too much fantastic i have an awesome option for you so let's say i have some kind of negative emotion and i'm unsatisfied with myself let's say i'm unsatisfied with my physical appearance okay so there's negative emotion here i've got two options i can do a lot of hard work okay and then i'm gonna add a caveat here and then maybe at the end of the hard work i'll feel good about myself okay or what i can do is daydream and then what i can do is feel good about myself right now so our brain has a choice both there are two roads to positive emotion one is daydreaming and one is doing something about it right but which one's easier which one's more efficient it's like kind of think think about it this way i mean like you know if you want to get water you don't walk a mile to your friend's house to get a glass of water you go to your kitchen or your sink or whatever and you get water from there your brain automatically takes the easiest path now there's another really important point to consider here which is that there's an assumption that hard work will lead to positive emotion and progress and feeling good about myself but if we actually look at this scenario i work on my goal for one day and it starts to feel overwhelming okay interesting so when you work towards your goal you feel overwhelmed i resent myself for not putting enough effort which acts like a catalyst and motivates me for a day or two so now if we're actually like if we're scientific about it what does hard work actually do if i work for one day if i do work for one day how do i feel at the end of it i feel overwhelmed this is what we assume happens but if we actually look at our experience these are the choices that we have and our brain is like you can work for a day get nothing accomplished feel overwhelmed and feel negative emotion feel resentment and then that in turn is going to go over here and reinforce this so which path do you think your brain is going to take it's going to take this path easy right because if we actually look if we use experimental data instead of our mind what we'll observe is that even working towards our goals can sometimes create negative emotion and then we get confused like oh my god why am i daydreaming all the time it's this simple right just look at yourself and you'll find this cycle so so a couple of other things about daydreaming second thing to understand so here i am in the present and i'm feeling bad about myself and when i daydream i go to the future future time one year in the future and here i'm happy i am triumphant and i feel good about myself and so the interesting thing is when so this person did the right thing they're like okay so if i want to get from here to here what i have to do is set a goal so let me set a goal right let me work towards my goals so i'm over here as i'm working towards my goals what tends to happen now if my goal is based on a fantasy if it's based on the daydream that goal is very very very far away and if the goal is very very very far away one day of effort is just right here it doesn't substantially move me towards my goal right so there's something else kind of interesting happens we touched on this yesterday and we've talked about it before but if my goal is up here and i'm over here and this is how far i move the gap is huge there's very little positive reinforcement for my brain right so this is why people say like you know have goals that are kind of like bite-sized you want to sort of reduce the size of your goals they're they're this is really important to understand because if we're basing our goals based on daydreams those are going to be pretty unrealistic goals and are going to set us up for a lack of positive reinforcement even when we make progress because like look at this for a second i work on my goal for a day and it starts to feel overwhelming like what like how are we gonna reinforce this kind of behavior like how are we gonna work for two days if working on my goal for one day is overwhelming so what's kind of interesting is like setting a goal that you can accomplish in one day then there's no progress there's no need to be overwhelmed because you're done right that's it so how do we tackle this problem now that we've sort of figured out we have two basic problems the first is that daydreaming is an emotional coping mechanism and daydreaming also anchors us in the future so this is kind of interesting but if we want to break out of this cycle once we understand the pathophysiology of it if we understand what daydreaming is how it works our answer actually becomes somewhat clear the first is that this is the wrong goal because if your goal is to stop worrying then daydreaming is the answer instead what we need to do number one is be able to tolerate negative emotion very very important right so develop some kind of alternate coping mechanism so instead of i don't know if this kind of makes sense but like sometimes in life we're buffeted by our negative emotions and our negative emotions control our behaviors they create avoidance we don't want to feel those negative emotions so we start avoiding all kinds of things and so as long as we set our goal is stop worrying or no longer feel anxious or like the elimination of negative emotion we lose control of our lives just surrender control entirely to the negative emotion because then what happens is if that's the goal is no more negative emotion the only things that you can do are the things that move you away from negative emotion and this is how you get stuck in the trap of daydream so this is kind of interesting but it's sort of like even this person's like negative emotions sometimes motivate them in the right way so this is important to understand why do human beings experience negative emotions it's because they're actually very powerful motivators they tend to be the strongest and easiest motivators but they're kind of like dirty motivators they're like burning unclean fuel okay so instead of trying to fix your negative emotion sit with it right so we've taught a lot of meditation like that's a very good example of you know tolerating negative emotion so when you feel some kind of negative emotion i'm not saying and this may you may so if you're listening to this you're like but like there's too much of it right but then how do i fix all my problems these are all the things that your mind will start like what do you mean tolerate negative emotion like that's not gonna make my dreams come true like tolerate it until when when does it end what i'm just supposed to sit and wallow in my negative emotion forever no that's that's your mind not knowing what's gonna happen when you learn to tolerate negative emotion like you just don't know how to do that right so it's so intolerable you start daydreaming to get rid of it you start playing video games to get rid of it you get eye to get rid of it so you don't know how to tolerate it because it's it feels so intolerable so that's where like you sit for like 15 20 minutes you meditate for a little while and what you'll tend to find is that the negative emotion will go away it may be triggered again by something else but just learning to be non-reactive to your negative emotions for at least a brief period of time for one hour a day for two hours a day will be very very revolutionary for your life then you're like how does it fix my problems well we've sort of explored how all of your problems start with this so if we sort of if this stops becoming a problem right then like this becomes easier if we kind of like get overwhelmed and we don't let that feeling of overwhelmness stop us from acting then we can continue to act and it's get it's pretty cool okay so number one is like learn to tolerate your negative emotions you can do that through meditation we'll give you a couple of other tips here second thing that's very important to do is adopt a present focus so remember goals are in the future and if i have a goal that i've set up for myself that's a year from now or two years from now if i've got let's say 800 days to get in shape what difference does it make if i don't exercise today not much right oh i've still got 799 days to get in shape how long does it take to get in shape i don't know maybe six months eight months so i mean i could go down to 400 days without making a single step towards my goal and i've still got plenty of time so goals are things of the future generally right and so what you really need to do is is don't focus on this step this phase of your life focus on this phase of your life what can i do today and just focus on that and this is where you've got to be careful because all kinds of negative emotions will come up if you start focusing on the present you'll be like it won't be enough but what if all kinds of thoughts what's the point what's the point of practicing piano for one day what's cool is playing piano and busting it out and impressing everyone you see how your mind automatically goes to that fantasy because once you start living in the present once you start moving into a present focus you're depriving of your mind of the ability to daydream and then your mind gets terrified and it's gonna fight you and it's gonna make you feel bad because if it makes you feel bad what does it get to do you're taking away your mind's crack and it ain't gonna like it and it's gonna try to punish you for it cause that's where you're gonna breathe you're gonna meditate you're gonna focus on what you can do today and so that's sort of where like if you wanna learn how to focus on the present the key thing to understand is that your mind is going to tell you all kinds of stuff like it's not enough but that's okay it doesn't need to be enough i'm just going to focus on what i'm going to do today and like that's my goal and i'm sticking to it if it's not enough that's okay and then your mind is like no but it's not okay because i want all these things i want these people to love me and i want all those things that's where you pause for a moment you talk to your mind and you kind of say i understand that you want those things i hope that we'll get them all that stuff is fine for the other 10 hours of today we can worry about that stuff but for the next two hours for this two hours we're not going to worry about that i'm going to exercise for 45 minutes i'm going to read for 45 minutes and i'm going to clean for 30 minutes the rest of the next 10 hours i can worry about how it's not going to be enough i can panic for 10 hours i don't need to panic for 12 hours a day 10 hours a day is sufficient so adopt a present focus and in terms of goals just focus on things that you can accomplish today and not even today focus on things that you can accomplish within 15 minutes in 30 minutes i'm gonna do one pomodoro of studying so be very very present focused so this is important because i don't know if like this kind of makes sense but i've worked with so back when i was doing primarily clinical work i was mostly an addiction psychiatrist and so i'd have patients who would come in and people who wanted to get sober two kinds of people who want to get sober people who want to be sober for a year and people who want to be sober for a day my goal is to be one year clean and generally speaking what i found is that people who focused on being sober today were much more successful than people who were trying to be sober for one year because you can't be sober for a year it's literally impossible there's nothing you can do to be sober for a year being sober for a year is an emergent property it is not something that is actually created it is something that is built up over time and that you can't actually do all you can do is be sober right now all you can do is not take that drink in this moment that's really all you can do and in the next moment you cannot take the next drink and in the next moment you cannot take the next string but literally the only thing that exists is the present and so once people realize and then it's the ones who are like okay yay i did it i'm sober for a year i accomplished my goal and what do you think happens over the next month they relapse because they did it right the battle is over we won easy we're going to hang up our weapons we're going to chill we're going to take off our armor we succeeded whereas the person who recognizes that this is a battle that i'll have to fight every single day is the one that actually wins so what is this this is a present focus and we need to adopt this especially for unhealthy coping mechanisms like daydreaming number three so this is the thing that people miss so as we look at this diagram what we see is that we're reinforcing all the wrong behavior this positive emotion that we experience actually reinforces the daydreaming the hard work that we actually do makes us feel overwhelmed and creates sort of like a a punishment actually this is it's not negative reinforcement it's punishment according to the terms of classical conditioning because if we work hard what do we do we feel overwhelmed and if we daydream what do we do we feel good so one of these leads to a punishment and one of them leads to a reinforcement so the other problem with this whole cycle is that we're reinforcing the wrong things we have an altered reinforcement and let's go back to the case so at the end of the day stuck in a loop where i have a goal in mind work on the goal for one day it starts to feel overwhelming right acts like a catalyst with which motivates me for a day or two so all the wrong stuff is being reinforced here so there's one thing that we need to start doing which is how to sort of build on our successes so all of these problems that people have we always focus on fixing the negative we want to take away the negative we want to stop worrying how do i do this how do i do this we're always focused on avoiding the pain removing the negative and like fixing the problem what we don't ever do is positive reinforcement or reinforce the positive so i'll give you just an example at the end of that one day of work that you've done what do you do cognitively before you go to bed do you feel good about yourself do you even bother to reflect on the day can you take a step back and say hey good job i know it feels like i haven't gone far enough but at least today was a win maybe i need to duplicate today but like i can actually like be proud of what i accomplished today do you guys get any sense of any kind of positive reflection in any of this post all i see here is self-loathing right i think what's fundamentally flawed within my mind is the belief that no one could ever love or appreciate me because if i'm not interesting enough no what's flawed in your mind is that you don't think you're interesting enough so then what you have to do is come up with like all these hobbies that you're good at to impress people because intrinsically you don't see the worth and you can see it like the way that this person beats themselves up with every sentence y'all see that and there's there's no positive reinforcement there's no appreciation which acts as a catalyst and motivates me for another day or two this is not a success in this person's mind i work on my goal for one day that's not a success that's a failure and when progress becomes a failure in our mind that's when we're truly screwed so what we've got to do is spend some time reflecting on the positive at least acknowledge our wins no matter how small they will be because right now we're recording our wins in the l column work for a day is that a win or a loss it's a loss because i only worked for one day i got motivated i worked for one to two days is that a win or a loss that's a loss because i only worked for one or two days well what would a win be well if i worked for 365 days in a row that would be a win you'll see this so this is something that people don't do often enough it's completely absent how do i stop daydreaming well there are days that you stop daydreaming right there are days that one day that you get something done a couple of days that you feel motivated so you can acknowledge all that negative stuff but at least spend a few moments to reinforce the positive at the end of the day say hey i don't know if this is going to be enough who knows what frame of mind i'll wake up in tomorrow but at least today i can be proud of what i did and notice how your mind is like what on earth like we'll rebel against that thought no no no no no what do you mean how can you be proud of not accomplishing anything you didn't accomplish anything your goal isn't met you haven't achieved the fantasies that i've created for you and then this person wonders that i once enjoyed regardless of the outcome that is how you do it regardless of the outcome do you see that like literally you train your mind your mind says that's not enough and you say okay who cares i don't care i did a good job today there's something i can be proud of today so whenever so this is key thing so oftentimes we get stuck in this cycle of like burst of motivation followed by like what period of wallowing in our despair and the problem is that even when we have the burst of motivation we don't reinforce that in any way shape or form all we think about is how do i get rid of the despair how do i get rid of the spare how do i get rid of the spare part of getting rid of the despair is acknowledging when you do have some win no matter how small and say you know what good job bro good job girl you did it it's not enough that's okay it may not be enough but like at least today i can be proud of what i accomplish and then your mind is like but you didn't accomplish anything even if i didn't accomplish anything i still moved forward towards my goal i did not spend the whole day daydreaming that's a win i did not spend a whole day playing a video game or binging stranger things on netflix or whatever there's something i can be proud of today and watch your mind as it rebels against that thought and as you do this especially your life will start to change because these kinds of things like this is built up in a moment like it's like moments in your mind of war subtle subtle war where your mind tries to convince you and you have to start winning those battles moment by moment by moment my moment by moment so it's a very common problem that people will daydream too much and then you don't actually you think about you build all these goals for yourself and you don't actually move towards the goals instead of what you do is you think about the goals and then we get stuck in the cycle of like you know daydreaming about this goal not moving towards the goal feeling resentful towards ourselves as we become resentful we'll get like this burst of angry motivation that wears off in a day or two and then we're kind of stuck back down square one and then like the cycle repeats so what do you do about this first thing is to understand the nature of daydreaming to understand that negative emotions are hard to tolerate and one way that we cope with them is we daydream because when i'm feeling bad about myself and i think about how awesome the future is going to be in my dreams i start to feel good about myself yay second thing to understand about daydreaming is that it takes us to the future right it's not that's the whole point is we're not stuck in this horrible present where we're not doing anything and not accomplish anything where people don't value us and things like that so like we love to be in the future because the present sucks and the future is a beautiful place that i can can construct with my mind and i can make it whatever i want because it's a fantasy how do you break out of this problem first thing is like stop running away from the negative learn to tolerate your negative emotion what do you mean by tolerate it that just means don't give in to whatever the default action of your negative emotion is for some period of time half an hour an hour so i recently started doing this thing just just to practice what i preach and i've stopped taking my phone into the bathroom no more phones in the bathroom it's like oh my god what am i gonna do for those five minutes that i'm using the restroom or even 60 seconds that i'm using the restroom what am i gonna do oh my god and you survive it it's like not that bad right the other thing is when i take my phone in the bathroom i'm there for like 15 minutes i don't need to be there for 15 minutes so learn to tolerate negative emotion second thing is start living in the present focus on the present focus on today third thing this is the thing that people miss the most is actually like acknowledge your positives at the end of the day reinforce that say hey like this is actually something like i may not have moved a significant amount towards my goal because your mind is going to tell you all this kind of crap but at least i did something i didn't waste the whole day daydreaming so if i've got a choice right this is what you tell your mind it's like i've got a choice i can spend the day learning to practice piano and i may never learn how to play it it may never be enough or i can spend the day daydreaming about practicing piano and becoming an awesome piano player which one do i want to pick i want to pick actually spending a day practicing the piano and that's what i actually did today so i lived my life today aligned with the person that i want to be even if it doesn't work at least i can take pride in that sounds completely foreign got to start practicing it you
