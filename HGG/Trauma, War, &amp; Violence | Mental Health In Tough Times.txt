like trauma is like a biological experience a psychological experience a human experience that bad things happen to humans so let's get started so today's stream is going to be a little bit different um we were planning on streaming eldon ring and i was very very excited about that but in light of recent events and what i mean by that is the conflict between russia and ukraine i just didn't feel it um i felt like there was something else to talk about which is a little bit more timely and important i love to play elden ring hopefully i'll play tonight i was stunned yesterday when it actually it seems like it got released yesterday um so just in light of what's going on and especially in light of several posts we've seen on our subreddit i thought i would try to take it this opportunity to talk a little bit about post-war trauma uh and coping so i think these are topics that are like really important to our community i think the other thing that i was very surprised by is that um we do have people in our community who are from these countries so when i was at ti of all places i was really surprised by the number of people who like walked up and introduced themselves and how they had you know ukrainian accents russian accents um and so there are a lot of our you know our community and and i think that's going to be an important part of what we talk about as we'll see so today what i'd like to do is talk a little bit about um what we've learned in terms of science about post-war kind of coping uh we're gonna be sort of basing today's talk on three peer-reviewed publications so one is going to be what we've learned from qualitative research from holocaust survivors the second is going to be a paper looking at how people managed to cope in 1999 with a set of air raids i believe in serbia uh let me double check no yugoslavia um and then the third study we're going to be kind of talking about which is really interesting is is going to share a perspective on coping mechanisms and stressors post-traumatic events which i think is is really interesting it's it's looking at people from bosnia adolescence specifically so what i'd like to do today is share a little bit about you know when people when we talk about trauma um we don't really understand how trauma affects people we don't really understand so a lot of the questions that we're getting is like what should i do and i don't know that i'm qualified to tell people what they should do in a situation like this i really don't feel qualified and at the same time i think that we do have or hopefully we have a responsibility or we're going to try to educate people about what we understand about how to cope with terrible situations i have had some degree of clinical experience in this stuff so the other kind of couple of disclaimers so the first is that i'm not an expert in trauma i'm not like a traumatologist i have not worked very extensively i mean i've worked for several months with people who are first responders so i've done trauma-based programs and things like that worked with 9 11 survivors worked with veterans from the afghan afghanistan and iraq war so i in primarily being a substance use clinician in a lot of ways like there's a lot of trauma kind of thrown in but we haven't really dug into how we understand how to cope with trauma too much on stream so today i'd like to share some information about that once again this is not like a substitute for medical care right so we're going to be talking about broad scale principles and like some important kind of takeaways i don't know that anything we're going to discuss on stream today is like a game plan for how to you know survive what's going on in ukraine right now i wish honestly i could offer that but the truth is that we just don't know right and when it comes to actually dealing with trauma like this is something that's an individual journey and what i'd love to do today is share some principles that we've sort of learned in the scientific community and through research about how we understand trauma um yeah does that make sense to people so we're gonna kind of dive in um so yeah i i think i'm i'm actually somewhat in a sense happy to be talking about this i know it sounds kind of weird but i think that we've learned so much from post-war survivors about the process of trauma which i think like really should like people should understand um so we've learned a lot about coping mechanisms there's something else that i'm not going to talk about today which we may depending on whether you all find this useful or not or interesting we may talk a little bit about this sometime next week but another topic that i was thinking about exploring today is post-traumatic growth versus post-traumatic stress so we know scientifically that like when you experience a traumatic event that like there's basically a fork in the road and you can go one of two ways you can kind of grow from the event and like integrate it into who you are and become sort of a stronger better person and then the other thing is is some people aren't able to cope with it very well and it sort of manifests as post-traumatic stress and so there's been a lot of really interesting research over the last 20 years about like what determines which path you go on and i think that kind of information is very very helpful a couple of other things that i want to mention the first is that i know that a lot of people are really struggling right now i imagine a lot of people are feeling terrified and hopeless we've certainly seen that on our subreddit um and and so one message that i'd have that i completely stand behind as as best as you can try to hold on to hope as best as you can i know that in situations like this and this is as someone who's worked with holocaust survivors 911 survivors things can absolutely feel incredibly hopeless in the moment but the truth is that no human being can predict the future and we have no idea what's going to come next and i say that sort of in a good way i'm optimistic about it we're going to share a little bit of research from holocaust survivors today about holding on to hope and and trying to manage um i know it sounds really bizarre but you know sometimes people can feel very very bad they can feel even suicidal hopeless etc uh you know i encourage you all to do whatever you can to take care of yourself do whatever you can to stay safe if you have access to mental health resources please use them if they're at your disposal and i know things can seem really really bleak right now but you know i think we've learned this in the world the past couple of years is like you know everyone thought they knew what was going to go what was going what 2020 was going to be like right and then this global pandemic emerged and and shattered the way that we lived in this world and now that the pandemic is ending we thought we were sort of done with it right and then this conflict happens between russia and ukraine and so we never know what's coming and sometimes that's bad stuff but it can also be good things and sometimes it's really really easy to lose hope but as best as you can don't because you don't you really don't know and i've seen the the work that i've done as a psychiatrist and also the work that i've done here at hg has really helped me appreciate how resilient and amazing human beings are and we are able to bounce back and there is kindness in the world and like there there is safety like you can find safety in this world you can find security in this world and even though it may be taken away from you for now and who knows i mean it you know people are undoubtedly going to perish in this conflict so i can't really say that you're going to be safe for sure but having worked with trauma survivors victims for many years now like i can assure you that you know for most people thankfully there is a light at the end of the tunnel right i can't say for everyone i'd love to say i i wish i could guarantee you that everything would be safe and happy five years from now in your life but i can't make that guarantee i don't have the power to do that i'm not divine but what i can tell you is that people who hold on to hope are oftentimes not disappointed and that's a statement that i stand 100 behind so let's get started oh the last thing that i want to sort of mention is a is almost like a trigger warning so some of the stuff that we're going to be talking about today um we're going to do our best to sort of stick to twitch tos so we're going to be citing a couple of scientific peer-reviewed papers the challenge is that some of the things that are discussed within these papers are actually like quite negative and graphic we're going to actually steer clear of the most graphic stuff as best as we can but i'm going to be showing direct quotes from the paper um and so you know just in terms of a trigger trigger warning like i just want y'all to try to you know if this is the kind of thing that you think could trigger you i'd i definitely recommend steering clear or maybe waiting until we have you know some kind of edited vaude or something like that um but we are gonna be talking about you know issues related to war and violence and and coping and trauma um so just kind of a trigger warning there we'll do our best to sort of keep i'm gonna steer clear of some of the worst stuff but it may get flashed on screen in terms of quotes and things like that so i apologize for that okay so let's get started so today what we're going to talk a little bit about is what we've learned from as a scientific community about post-war coping and sort of how to survive or what factors predict kind of healthy integration um from traumatic experiences and so once again this is the kind of thing where it's i wish i could give you all a script and say if you do a b and c if you do d e and f that you will be fine but we don't really we can't really say that um fairly and that that i think is okay because what i'm going to share with you all today is some basic principles about what we understand about how to cope with negative situations so as researcher when researchers look at people like holocaust survivors um post-war survivors adolescence and development like what are the things that constitute or what can we sort of determine from research by looking at masses of people like what helps people cope what helps people survive and what helps people integrate so the first study that we're going to look at is gonna be a qualitative study of holocaust survivors okay so and i'm gonna sort of talk a little bit about um you know why we're sort of focusing on this study so this is a study that looks at immediate post-war coping strategies of adolescent survivors of the holocaust the other thing that we're going to be focusing on today is going to be primarily looking at studies of younger populations so i think a lot of people in our community are young um so i i sort of we sort of focused on younger populations so if we look at holocaust survivors what are the coping mechanisms which they employed that seemed to matter so this is a qualitative study so what that means is that this person essentially did interviews with a small sample of people and basically asked them questions about what their experience of the holocaust was what they felt was helpful in terms of of coping and we're going to kind of go over some of those kind of key takeaways that this person sort of discovered okay so the first thing is that we have to understand the population that we're dealing with so these are people who lost everything we're talking about holocaust survivors a lot of them fled to poland um even in poland they experienced a lot of persecution sometimes violence racism anti-semitism and this is one of the things that's really really challenging about post-war refugees is that the trauma doesn't necessarily stop when you escape the country and i know that that sounds like really hopeless there's good news there too but i think it's important to acknowledge that it's not like once you leave the danger zone like you're free of danger that even when you go somewhere else there's a foreign language there may be foreign people there may be foreign you know there may be racism or other issues and but that these people essentially lost everything so they lost family they lost friends they lost you know homes they left pictures behind memories they got separated from people so these people have been through something just incredibly incredibly challenging so i'm gonna just share a quick quote um so we're gonna just go down to page three so how can you feel hopeful when you don't know where to go you don't know for what to go we were just not human i was so broken down after we were liberated more than being in the concentration camps i suffered emotional i missed my oldest sister with her little boy whom i loved i missed my friend this was my first love in my youth when we were liberated i said where should i go why should i live the interesting thing is that people also expressed in addition to feeling hopeless people expressed gratitude for being alive and free so we were maybe more enthusiastic than before the war because to go through such pains and hunger and all kinds of troubles for those years all of a sudden you became a human being again and you have everything you need just not to breathe the german air was great we lived in a group home that the jewish agency provided we had no clothes but our needs were so limited we were just glad to be free and breathe and no one to tell you what to do so and we'll kind of get to this in a second but i think that's going to be a common theme for today and hopefully that doesn't rub people the wrong way you know we're always open to your feedback but i think it's normal for people to feel hopeless and confused in these situations not know where they're supposed to go or why they should go anywhere or why they should continue living and at the same time like after you sort of work through that for a little while or live through that many people i would even say the majority of people are even able to find light and hope and and some sense of relief and joy and to be able to rebuild lives after the end of it so here's one of the key things that the study found the first step to overcoming trauma is safety so when we think about emotional processing doing this kind of work like you know making meaning we'll kind of get to all these other steps but one of the things that's been borne out in research over and over and over again is like all that crap comes later the first thing that you need is to be safe and you can't really do any of the work of trauma processing as long as you're in an unsafe situation and this is where unfortunately there have been a couple of studies that have shown that like intensive psychological debriefing in the midst of trauma has actually had some detrimental effects so we'll talk about trauma processing a little bit later so trauma processing from psychotherapists for example can be helpful or harmful and that's a whole different discussion but essentially prior to reconstruction prior to remembrance and prior to reconnection which are sort of the steps in one model of trauma processing so the first is we have to make sense of the event and then this also involves like rebuilding our lives to a certain degree right moving to a new country making social connections we'll kind of get to that in a second so we have to reconstruct our our lives and both internally and externally the next thing that we have to do is remember in some ways so this is the process of mourning acceptance letting go and this can be incredibly difficult right so if we think about holocaust survivors for example like they're never going to get to go to their home again right the home that they grew up in presumably and we don't really know if that's ever going to happen and then finally what we sort of want in terms of trauma processing is reconnection so this is when we sort of form relationships we kind of fully reconnect with life and hopefully at this point we're able to live a completely normal and fulfilling life but you can't do any of these things in an unsafe environment so this is where like safety has to come first and this is where unfortunately like even in the post-war environments as we sort of already mentioned just because you're out of the immediate danger zone doesn't mean that you're necessarily safe there can be concerns about shelter there can be concerns about racism physical violence sexual violence um so safety has to come first so the first thing is you know try to be safe and don't worry about trauma processing or anything like that like you you just safety absolutely comes first this also goes for anyone out there who's kind of struggling and feeling unsafe in terms of suicidal thoughts or hurting someone else you know i strongly encourage you to as best as you can get some kind of support over that and safety really does come first so this is kind of interesting so after looking at that the next thing that people sort of noticed is that um what people need next is community so here uh here's a kind of another quote that we're going to share so these are three people that they interviewed judah rivka and ruth clearly articulate these group living arrangements is an attempt to recreate family after such a test we went through everybody was happy to be alive even though that life had not too much meaning without families but we had so many friends who were in the same situation we somehow lived together and got close very seldom that somebody had a family a father a mother or brothers they were all single survivors or maybe two brothers from one family that survived or something like that then this is how we got back on track of living what happens when you have no family you form families and a lot of people started eating together and it's a normal life but it's it's not a normal life but it's the best you can do like communes i had no family but i made family survivors need to be among their own people for support in the early recovery period but this did not necessarily help the grieving process so we'll kind of get into that in a second but this is where the second thing that people need is community and this is why actually i'm really proud of like our community so um you know when people post on our subreddit and things like that it's like i don't want to underestimate like the value of those kinds of things like i know it feels small and i know it feels insignificant i'm gonna tear up a little bit but um you know but like i think that these things do matter and like the research actually suggests that it's not deep trauma processing with a traumatologist that these people need right away the first thing that they need is to be safe and the second thing that they need is like a sense of community and a sense of family and we're gonna kind of show a couple of other quotes about that but like this is incredibly important when it comes to mental health it's more than the treatment of mental illness like there are some very very basic things that human beings need in order for their mental health to be like good right and one of those core things is like connection with other human beings and so we see this with holocaust survivors it'll be a theme throughout the day and it's something that i hope our community can provide i'm not saying that it's any substitute for certainly not mental health treatment and certainly not family but like in whatever way we can we should support the members of our community i know it may feel insignificant but this is the kind of thing we'll talk about this towards the end as well about sort of like cumulative risk factors and cumulative protective factors where we don't really know what's going to help or what may be insignificant but like as best as we can as a community we need to support people who are struggling and try to be there for them um because the truth is that community actually does matter quite a lot so um so this is also where even even when it comes to sort of dealing with like the post-traumatic experiences there the this paper sort of talks a little bit about how people like uh i'll just kind of read this but i know that by that time i had nobody left i'm alone except for my cousins we tried to keep busy but because i had no nobody i became very hard i didn't leave my emotions that i should cry to someone because they all lost family i wasn't the only one they were in the same situation so we tried not to grieve you know but separately in my heart i did so perhaps um so it is hard to ascertain from rivka's account whether her decision to grieve separately in her heart rather than share her emotions with other survivors who were also grieving from within or from observing how others around her were behaving perhaps it was a little bit of both so we tried not to grieve seems to imply an unspoken group norm so this is where um you know it's it's kind of interesting because like people weren't necessarily actively going through the grieving process it was um something that they uh you know it was something that they sort of formed a community and sometimes kind of talked about and sometimes sort of didn't talk about uh they also formed displaced person communities so this was sort of um you know as they like these are almost like refugee camps or things like that like places where they had hospitals and and where people sort of got together in this community aspect was really really like an important part of their healing and their growth and their coping uh interesting thing here is that once again they didn't explicitly um talk about emotions very much which we'll sort of see as a theme and in my experience kind of trauma processing doesn't need to be forced it sort of happens at its own pace so this is where things get a little bit tricky so the other important like coping strategy that people used was actually like anger dealing with injustice and what i'm going to actually do is instead of just quoting this i'm going to move this over here so i can write at the same time so this is where um people another way that people do cope is by sort of like getting angry so they're they're you know there are instances where when dealing with issues of racism people would sort of like or anti-semitism people would kind of lash out there are also cases uh in this qualitative interview of of some of the trauma survivors engaging in violent behavior um we don't really advocate for that and even the authors of the paper sort of suggest that engaging in violent behavior against um other people who are maybe being anti-semitic or racist may be a short-term coping strategy but probably doesn't lead to like long-term improvement so this is where um you know anger can sort of be productive or unproductive so let me just read another kind of quote here i'm going to try to steer clear of showing this stuff on stream so the agency and anger expressed by survivors after the war were channeled in both productive and non-productive ways anger was taken to the extreme by a few people um so and some people sort of found that like even doing small things like stealing from their oppressors or things like that helped them kind of cope and get a sense of justice um so the researchers sort of suggest that i would hypothesize that such acts were only temporary salves for their wounds they may have been effective as short-term coping strategies but there's little evidence to suggest that these men are at peace with themselves in the long term as a result of their actions so there's and this is where what we're going to talk a little bit about now is like forgiveness so this is where in trauma theory there's sometimes an emphasis for forgiveness that in order to let go and process your trauma in order to accept what you kind of have to do is forgive right so like the good thing to do it's like healthy to forgive okay so forgiveness is a key part and like even in terms of some trauma group some trauma groups will have kind of anger management components where we encourage people to forgive to accept and that moving past your anger is like an important part of this reconstitution of a healthy identity it's important to point out though that this is like somewhat disputed and that other clinicians actually don't believe that forgiveness is necessary in fact some clinicians will argue that forgiveness is actually unattainable in a very practical sense so if we're thinking about you know war-related atrocities or physical violence emotional violence sexual violence it can actually be quite toxic to try to get someone to forgive so there are some downsides to forgiveness so sometimes in the process of forgiveness what we actually do is exacerbate feelings of low self-worth and you'll see this if if people kind of get pressured to forgive right because then like what happens like i've seen this a lot unfortunately in unh healthy family situations where people will be like pressured to forgive right oh like it was a mistake they've learned their lesson like you should forgive so that the family can move on and heal and so what happens is that there's sort of this burden placed on the victim of forgiving and if they're not able to then like the family is the family unit suffers and and like this kind of thing can actually be like bad right because what it can sort of if if i'm not able to forgive let's say that i was abused by you know a parent or uncle or something like that physically emotionally whatever and and so then if i'm not able to forgive i start to think like lower of myself like oh why can't i forgive everyone is saying i should forgive i should be able to forgive because there's this camp up here right which is saying that oh the way to move on with your life is to forgive and so some clinicians have actually found and i kind of fall into this camp as well that forgiveness is not a necessary part i think acceptances but that forgiveness is is purely no one is entitled to forgiveness it's it's purely the person who is the victim gets to decide that's personally where i kind of stand um the other thing is that people may not be able to right so depending on what's done to you i'm not so sure that someone who's fleeing the ukraine right now will ever be able to forgive someone who's taken away family members homes etc right like they may not be able to it's not like human beings don't have an endless capacity to forgive very practically speaking now if you want to talk about on the spiritual sense and things like that maybe there is a you could make an argument that to grow as a human being you should have you know the closer you get to endless forgiveness the more positive of a person you become but i don't know that um i don't know that that's necessarily true from like a scientific perspective or a trauma healing perspective the last reason uh that we want to so forgiveness the last kind of thing is that sometimes it's actually very disempowering for the victim right so like it's kind of interesting here but um you know so like you can sometimes disempower the survivor while having the effect of like empowering the perpetrator right because if like if you sort of are forced to forgive or you end up forgiving then you're kind of like wiping that away in a sense um the other person sort of gets to walk away from it they're kind of feeling good about themselves there are several papers that have sort of talked about this the point here at least for the purpose of this kind of lecture is that forgiveness can be good and it can not be good and this is where trauma is like very complicated right there are individual circumstances individual people with different personality traits different coping mechanisms and should you for consider forgiveness absolutely do you need to accept and reintegrate what has happened to you into your life absolutely but do you need to forgive not necessarily and so i you know i think that's where like it's complicated and it's nuanced and there isn't a simple answer that dr k can give you on in a lecture and that the desire to forgive or the need to forgive or the need not to forgive is something that you as an individual need to decide and the good news is that both roads can lead to healing presuming you kind of do it well enough okay the last thing is a sense of justice so this is what i thought was really interesting about the paper is that what they sort of focused on were things that were like ultimately like non-clinical in terms of coping strategies so some people um you know some people who were survivors like really really like felt that a part of their healing process was watching the nuremberg trials uh you know some people took things into their own hands which we don't advocate for at all so i i personally don't advocate for violence in pretty much any case but i think that the pursuit of justice is like a completely different matter right so when when there are are institutions and rules that we should abide by to sort of get justice that that's totally fine and so a lot of people did feel a sense of closure and kind of like completion with uh through things like the nuremberg trials and so the last thing that i kind of want to talk a little bit about was hope um so i'm going to read this quote to y'all generally the survivors were full of hope regarding their new lives those who were married were eager to start in a new land the rest with the exception of ruth who was all alone had some surviving family members with whom they could emigrate many the survivor's first choice was israel but wasn't always possible so here are a couple of quotes we wanted to go anywhere just get away from germany and when my wife became pregnant i said uh-oh now i'm the father of a child not yet born and to go to palestine was already too dangerous i'm not responsible only for myself i'm now responsible for a wife and child so then we registered for america i wish we had gone to israel but we couldn't i did not want to go illegal in any way and also i didn't want to go into another war we would have gone on the exodus you know but my husband and sisters here we went to america and um some of the survivors adjusted quite quickly to the new life in america and canada i was young i didn't mind going i was happy and when i came to america i felt really very good i felt free it's a free country and i felt wonderful here it was tough but it was paradise you know nobody was trying to kill you you always had something to wear something to eat i mean it's a haven and so the the key thing here is like we don't i know that things can feel really hopeless but i think we can sort of acknowledge that the holocaust is one of the most grueling things that people have had to live through and that people can come out the other end with hope and that presumably as people sort of engaged in safety in community to a certain degree kind of managing their anger and seeking justice that at the end of the day you know hope is possible rebuilding a life is possible and i know that if you're someone who's kind of caught in the middle of a traumatic situation that the mind looks at our current situation and kind of expects the worse predicts the worst that's sort of a survival mechanism right so as human beings we have to think about worst case scenarios it's what our brains are kind of designed to do in order to protect us and at the same time just because your brain is thinking about a worst case scenario doesn't necessarily mean that that thing is going to happen and this is where i've just seen time and time again like how resilient the human spirit can be so the next paper we're going to talk about is a little bit different so this is a paper that's looking at let me tell you all the exact population so this is a paper that looks at civilians during the air attacks of yugoslavia in 1999 um so this is a paper that we're going to kind of cover very briefly that talks about coping strategies for um that people use so now if we have a traumatic event okay what people sort of look at is if i have a traumatic event do i develop ptsd and the answer is that in here there's all kinds of stuff right so even with a shared event if we have one traumatic event we may develop ptsd for this person but not for this person so you could go this way or you could go this way and what's the difference and it turns out that how you cope is a really really important part of the development of psychiatric symptoms or not necessarily even a clinical diagnosis but how you manage and how what your life ends up being has a lot to do with coping so what i'm going to do today is talk a little bit about coping and sort of what some people sort of discovered so the first is that so when they were looking at the yugoslav yugoslavia air attacks um in 1999 what they found is that different people and we'll kind of talk a little bit more about this but that different people use different primary coping strategies so there were a bunch of different coping strategies people used like humor talking with each other they even used leisure activities uh so there are like eight or nine different coping strategies that people used but what we're gonna sort of do and this is gonna is zero in on a couple of those so one group used predominantly leisure activities and what we sort of found here is that people who use predominantly leisure activities had um sort of had a low amount of intrusive thoughts so this is a correlation so this is something that was studied after the fact which is important to understand and that people who spent a lot of time talking debriefing discussing what they had gone through had a higher level of intrusive thoughts the other thing that's important here is that some of these effects are also modified by gender so whether you go this like so when you have a traumatic event and use coping strategy one and you are male versus female versus coping strategy number two if you are male versus female you actually get different effects so this can lead to you know a positive thing or a negative thing this can lead to a negative thing or a positive thing and the reason that we i sort of highlight this is just because like this just goes to show that like trauma is not simple it's not as simple as okay for a given traumatic event if i do this then i will be fine versus doing this as bad right there there are all kinds of different variables that go into this which we'll sort of present in more detail later the other thing that's important to remember about studies like this is these are correlational so for if we say that people who um engaged in leisure activities had fewer intrusive thoughts does that mean that leisure activities reduce so question for you to a chat does this mean that leisure activities reduce intrusive thoughts does that mean that talking increases intrusive thoughts no absolutely not right so this is where correlation does not imply causation which is something that i find the majority of the world doesn't really appreciate so what this could mean is that the people who had fewer intrusive thoughts were maybe more able to engage in leisure activities and maybe the people who had more intrusive thoughts were the ones who were like kind of forced to talk about it more right so correlations don't necessarily imply causation which is a really really important point that's really what i wanted to illustrate here so when even when we're talking about some of this research you know as i'm drawing conclusions or as i'm sort of drawing conclusions for you all i want to make sure that we're all on the same page that these these conclusions are like very preliminary in nature and we shouldn't read too much into them so this paper also sort of sets up some of these details which now i'm going to talk about in more um detail here so what i'd like to share kind of towards the end is a perspective on how to think about trauma so here's what i sort of want to point out so this is a study that looked at bosnian adolescence and i think it may be 555 people in bosnia and so what we sort of discover is there's a traumatic event so this is kind of the cycle of trauma and then after a traumatic event we have post-war stressors based on the post-war stressors we employ coping strategies right so different kinds of things can happen to you after a traumatic traumatic event and then based on the coping strategies that we use for the stressor that we deal with we can sort of end up with a certain way of gauging stress response so this is kind of the outcome okay so actually i'm going to go ahead and move this around a little bit because i think i'm going to need more space so people ask how do i deal with trauma okay if someone asks the question how do i deal with trauma this is where i'd say like this is why it's complicated this is why working with a professional can be really really good right because it's not as simple as oh i should do this or i should do this or i should do this and at the same time i think it is important why isn't one okay okay sorry about that so this is where like it kind of gets complicated but i love to illustrate this for y'all so this is a paper that looked at um let's just define our population because this is really important too so this paper looked at predicting adolescent post-traumatic stress in the aftermath of war and the population they looked at as the vast majority of youth who lived through the bosnian war were exposed to multiple traumatic events including interpersonal violence community destruction and the loss of a loved one this study examined factors that predict post-war psychological adjustment specifically post-traumatic stress in bosnian adolescence okay so the first thing that this paper sort of realizes is that after a traumatic event there are different kinds of triggers that people have so the first is trauma reminders the second is loss reminders okay and the third is what we call secondary adversities and these are things like family conflict okay so what this sort of means is that like after a war if we really think about what do we have to deal with as a human being like what happens in our psychology like it's not just that initial event right it's all of the other things that happen after that so one thing that this this paper sort of highlights and other papers have approved this is that sensory experiences are strong triggers as opposed to like memory so what does this mean or kind of visual stuff what this means is that the the strong trauma reminders the things that really invoke that kind of trauma memory are like deeply sensory experiences so these are things like smells sounds so i've seen this a lot where um you know when i work with like post-war veterans what i find is that like it's like noises like car mufflers going off uh doors slamming that really remind them of like gunshots or explosive devices or things like that and that's actually what really kind of like triggers them so interestingly enough what the paper found is that you know watching stuff on tv like seeing pictures of like your country is not as triggering as like a particular smell or a particular sound or things like that okay so the second thing that uh people they sort of talked about is loss reminders so this is like pictures of loved ones or like activities that you used to do so if if i lost you know a parent in the war and we used to go fishing when i go fishing that sort of counts as a loss reminder and so these are the different things that can kind of like trigger you know some kind of traumatic response some kind of traumatic stress and remember based on this trigger there are different coping strategies and we'll sort of see how different coping strategies result in like alterations and the stress response the last thing is family conflict so this is really really big so increased responsibility this one is huge so a lot of times what happened with these bosnian war survivors is you had adolescents who were thrust into a role of responsibility for the family i'm a 16 year old kid who suddenly now is like the man of the household right so dad is no longer around so i have to step up i'm responsible for physical protection i'm responsible for financial protection i'm responsible for all kinds of things and so there's a large sense of burden and this is incredibly stressful in terms of like creating you know stress responses so what we sort of find in terms of stress responses is people will measure hyper arousal so these are different things that we'll measure for ptsd remember that just because you have some of these things does not necessarily mean that you have ptsd ptsd is a clinical diagnosis so even in this paper what they're sort of doing is looking at attributes that may be parts of the stress response which may or may not directly link to a diagnosis so hyperarousal avoidance re-experiencing that's like a flashback and numbing and so the key thing here about this paper this is what's really cool about it is if you're trying to figure out like okay if i've had a traumatic event and these are my triggers what predicts whether hyperarousal is high or low what predicts whether avoidance is high or low what predicts whether re-experiencing is high or low what predicts whether my feeling of numbness is high or low it turns out that there's a variable amount of coping strategies so there's variation in what kind of coping strategy you employ that correlates with like how your stress response is okay so let's talk about coping so uh do i do this here let me do this here so in terms of coping we're gonna divide coping strategies into a couple of buckets okay the first is engaging coping strategies and the second is disengaging coping strategies so disengaging coping strategies include denial avoidance or wishful thinking okay so when we experience something bad we can cope by disengaging from the bad thing so i'm gonna like pretend it's not real it's not real it's not real it's not real i can avoid the thing entirely right so i even i experience this i'm not saying that what i've gone through is anywhere near what bosnian war refugees have gone through but i remember personally like doing my best to avoid going to spanish class not checking my email not looking at my syllabus when i was failing out right so this is like goes applies to serious trauma but also the small struggles we have in life sometimes what we also do is wishful thinking so a large group of of our community is very concerned about maladaptive daydreaming so we've talked about maladaptive daydreaming i think we have a video on youtube about it um there's also the fantasy trap from dr k's guide which sort of goes into this so but that's absolutely a coping strategy right is to disengage from the thing that's bothering you now in terms of engaging coping strategies there are two types the first is a primary coping strategy in which we directly react to what we feel and then there's a secondary coping strategy in which we adapt to what we feel now this may sound kind of the same but we'll kind of go into more details but like when we experience something emotionally like we have reactions to it right so if i'm feeling something emotionally i can use emotional expression i can literally vent my feelings okay i can use problem solving to a certain degree this kind of confuses me a little bit but it's classified as a primary coping mechanism and then we can also use emotional regulation strategies so i think the key thing here is these are like direct ways to react to what's going on internally then the adaptive the secondary coping strategies are adaptive in nature so that's like not necessarily dealing with the emotion but how do i integrate this emotion into the rest of my life so this involves more cognitive stuff this involves like acceptance this involves things like cognitive restructuring this is like making meaning or finding meaning out of what happens to you this also includes distraction and i think there's like some confusion here between like avoidance and distraction but remember that like avoidance is sort of subconscious distraction is like intentional right so if i am having a rough day at work i can sort of like say okay you know what i'm gonna like take a break from work and for in an hour i'm gonna intentionally like play elden ring i'm gonna play lost ark whereas avoidance is sort of like mindlessly going into games and stuff and like watching youtube or whatever and like just avoiding the whole problem whereas distraction is sort of an intentional adaptation okay and the two are very different like you may think like okay but can you play games and that's why like gaming for example can be a healthy coping mechanism or an unhealthy coping mechanism and sometimes people will ask the question okay how do i know if gaming is a healthy coping mechanism or unhealthy coping mechanism there are lots of answers to that question but what i really love about this formulation of trauma stress response triggers and coping is that we can draw the distinction between the intentionality of gaming are you using it actively as an adaptation are you using it as a way of disengaging okay so what we sort of discover is that based on what you do for one of these things the coping strategy you employ actually results in different symptoms okay or different like levels of stress response so let's take a look at this so if you have a trauma reminder like you have um uh a um like let's say i smell something right and if i use a primary engaging coping mechanism this is remember this is like emotional expression regulation okay or regulation what this does is essentially like improve just about everything okay so this this is going to lead to improvements in all of these four categories okay uh yeah i think so so we sort of see this in terms of like sensory grounding and mindfulness right so like when i have someone who is really really struggling and emotionally very activated we know that engaging in mindfulness techniques which is sort of directly dealing with our emotions regulating our emotions we know that for example mindfulness techniques can affect our sympathetic tone so the amount of adrenaline that's flowing through our body that this actually has positive effects i think on all four of these dimensions we may be missing one dimension the interesting thing is that secondary um secondary engaging so this is adaptation so if we try to like make sense of things cognitive release restructure accept what's going on this has positive effects on everything except for avoidance so this is where we get a positive here we get a positive here we get a positive here okay the problem is that um let me just make sure so hyperarousal yeah so everything except for avoidance so it seems like you know primarily engaging can help us with avoidance but secondary engaging adaptations may not actually do that and then the third thing that we've got is disengagement and what it looks like is that disengagement basically doesn't help with anything so disengagement actually makes things worse in all dimensions okay and so this is where it's it's kind of like interesting but so what we can sort of take away from this is if we're thinking about okay let's say that you've been through a traumatic event and you're trying to figure out how should i cope what are good coping strategies and the key thing that i want you all to take away from this is that like coping is a complicated process right so coping involves first of all like recognizing that there are different triggers and that the way that we respond to those triggers will ultimately determine like our final stress stress response and that there isn't you know a good coping strategy or like there's not an ideal coping strategy and this is precisely why like if you have been through a traumatic experience you should work with a trained professional if you can um it because this is where like trained professionals recognize this why you go to a professional is because like they recognize that okay not all of these three things are the same the actual work with trauma involves ideally a clinician sort of going through this stuff and sort of trying to figure out okay what are your triggers what are the different coping strategies we can use right so in psychotherapy you may like have an adaptation or make sense of it man's search for meaning which is a book written by viktor frankl who is a holocaust survivor i think is just like an epic version of a secondary engaging coping mechanism right so he like made sense of the world and this is where you know i think like you can use the evidence sort of suggests that you just need some kind of framework it's not that one framework is better than another framework so the framework that i tend to use is a very karmic framework it's sort of like recognizing that you know your actions have consequences and that things that happen to you happen for a reason and how can we make sense of this it's not to say that necessarily that the theory of karma is true it's not about it being right or wrong it's about it being functional so some people will use stoicism some people will use religion some people will use psychology the main thing is not that you that one kind of adaptive model is like better than the others it's that you as an individual need to figure out like what is the adaptive model you want to use what makes sense to you about the world do you want to take a karmic approach do you want to take a stoic approach do you want to take a you know like body keeps the score scientific approach do you want to lean on religious traditions do you want to lean on family traditions like you know how do you want to manage this but at the end of the day it seems like the you know the three major options for coping strategies are to react to our emotions or deal with our emotions in sort of a reactive way like how do we emotionally regulate how do we emotionally express how do we solve problems around the emotional things that we have the there's a secondary type of engagement which is how do we adapt to what we experience how do we make sense of things how do we cognitively restructure how do we determine what this means for me in my life am i so a good example of this is like i think cancer survivors do this the oncology does this really well with cancer survivors where like we sort of talk about being a cancer survivor or a trauma survivor is like a part of our identity right we make it a part of our identity and then we start doing fundraising and we start supporting other people who have cancer and things like that so that's like an example of like a secondary engaging coping mechanism where i'm gonna adapt to this i'm gonna make it a part of who i am and like that's okay like it doesn't have to even though it becomes a part of my identity it doesn't have to be like a bad thing in my identity we see that as well with trauma survivors as well as they engage in peer support services as they you know as as you have these refugees these jewish refugees that are coming from germany to the united states and canada you have local people who are jewish who will then like support those people and then like you know as you as a trauma survivor begin to heal you start to support other people and that's where this sort of adaptation comes in and the last option is we do have disengaging possibilities right we have avoidance we have denial we have wishful thinking and those tend to exacerbate or not do very well in terms of like managing the stress response this too is something that i don't necessarily think that just because these are not great for you in the moment doesn't mean that you can't employ them so as a clinician what i would say is that like you know you have to start where where you are and the process of taking unhealthy coping mechanisms and developing healthy coping mechanisms is like challenging and kind of an uphill battle it can absolutely be done but be patient with yourself right don't just beat yourself up if you're using disengaging coping mechanisms so just to kind of summarize um i know we were supposed to stream elden ring today but i felt like in light of everything that's going on and some of the messages that i've seen from our community i just didn't really feel like playing games on stream today um and instead what i tried to do very briefly is talk a little bit about what we understand from post-war studies of people who have been through traumatic events so a couple of key key takeaways the first is that by doing deep qualitative research with holocaust survivors we recognize that there are four major aspects to coping the first is that you need to be safe so none of the work of processing can really happen you can't really reconstruct you can't remember and you can't reconnect unless you're safe the second thing is that community is incredibly important right so if people are trying to figure out what should i do just first of all try to get safe secondly like try to engage in some kind of community driven activity right so like connect with other human beings don't worry about processing your trauma or whatever the next thing i mean you can if you want to if you're ready to by all means go for it next thing that's important is to acknowledge that anger and forgiveness are like an important part of this equation there isn't a clear answer here some people like to act on their anger we don't really recommend that at all at the same time remember that forgiveness is a complicated issue and sometimes there's a bias towards like forgiving being a part of the trauma healing process i think that's true for some people but it doesn't have to be true for everyone and it's okay to not forgive the last thing is seeking justice so this is where you know if we just look at the data getting some kind of justice in terms of people who have wronged you can be very healing in terms of trauma so to find people who have attacked you to you know be held to justice that the nuremberg trials were actually like very like trauma healing for holocaust survivors last thing to kind of point out is that we also know from several studies that psychological debriefing can be helpful or hurtful depending on the circumstance so we know that there's overwhelming evidence that therapy for trauma can be very very good but we also have studies that show that psychological debriefing especially immediately after a trauma can actually have the opposite effect so how should you know whether you should engage in therapy or not that sort of depends on you and depends on what your experience is right so if you're really struggling if you're feeling suicidal if you're feeling hopeless i strongly encourage you to go see a mental health professional but also don't feel obligated to see someone if you don't feel comfortable with it so my overwhelming experience working with trauma is that it should be done at the pace of the person right so me as the clinician i don't determine i don't say we're gonna dig into your trauma today and you dig and you dig and you dig no like you let the person decide and dictate what happens so if you feel like you're ready to see a therapist you should absolutely go do that if you feel like you're not quite ready that's totally fine too it doesn't hurt to get an evaluation next thing that we sort of talked about is that there are differential effects of coping mechanisms that depending on what you're dealing with how you respond to it can affect the stress response that you experience so we talked a little bit about leisure activities versus processing we talked a little bit about correlation versus causation so we also have to be careful because just because we demonstrate that a particular coping activity such as leisure activity as opposed to talking about it leads to less experiencing of kind of stress related stuff may not mean that i should just try to have fun right because that there could be a chicken or egg problem there where the reason that people are able to engage in leisure activities is because they've sort of processed their trauma a little bit better already the last thing that we talked about and this i thought is really really interesting is a model for understanding how to cope with different trauma and there are a couple of important parts to this model the first is that after a traumatic event the actual post-war stressors can be varied so some people may experience a particular kind of stressor other people may experience a different kind of stressor so in looking at bosnian adolescence we found that some people experience very very like sensory trauma triggers whereas other people experience a large sense of burden and family conflict like oh my god i have to take care of my family now and that sort of made them it made it difficult to sleep it made it make them made them more avoidant it made them feel numb so the kinds of things that you experience are going to be individualized furthermore that coping strategies are not all the same that we have engaging coping strategies which involve primary engagement which is sort of divine defined as reacting to emotion so emotional regulation emotional expression to a certain degree emotional problem solving so that's like directly reacting to what you feel and we have adaptive coping strategies which are sort of like not directly reacting to it but making sense of it and integrating it into other parts of your life so these include things like cognitive restructuring acceptance and other like more global stuff right it's like micro versus macro coping strategy and then we also have disengaging coping strategies which a lot of people use like avoidance denial and even like um wishful thinking or fantasy and generally speaking what we find is that depending on what your problem is and what coping strategy you employ you're going to create a different effect on your like stress level so how hyper aroused you are how numb you are how much you re-experience how you sleep all of those things are going to be a confluence of what your triggers are and what your coping strategies are the key thing here is that there isn't one formula for trauma i wish i could say hey if you're in the ukraine and you're fleeing right now do a b and c and you'll be fine but i can't say that i don't think anyone can say that trauma in the experience of trauma dealing with trauma coping with trauma is an individualized journey that is so complicated at the same time i want you all to understand that there is a way forward right we're understanding more and more about this just because i can't give you an answer in one hour about what you should do does not mean that there is not an answer out there does not mean that you are going to be feeling this way for the rest of your life does not mean that the world is a hopeless place i know it feels that way right now and i'm not even going to say that you're wrong in thinking that right because i can't even imagine what it's like to have the city that i live in shelled by missiles right like i've never experienced anything like that so if you feel hopeless like i can only imagine what that feels like at the same time i want to say that if we really do look at the research that there is hope that people of it that human beings are incredibly resilient that human beings can find a way to find happiness and sort of reintegrate into society and enjoy things again right and like i truly do believe that it's it's part of the reason that i do the work that i do and the more that i do the work that i do and this is kind of the weird paradoxical thing you know a lot of times people think it's hard to be a psychiatrist because like don't all of these people weigh you down and listening to everyone like sure emotional burnout can be a problem but the more i've worked in this way the more inspired i am by humanity and the more that you really see like holy crap this person has been through so much how on earth are they able to get out of bed in the morning and like do anything and the more that i've worked with people the more i've seen like honestly like human beings are way more possess so much more strength and resilience than like i had any idea of and you don't see that until you see a human being who has been tested and so like oddly enough i feel humbled and amazed by what humans are capable of and it's given me hope that despite how terrible of the world how terrible the world can feel at times that like i have hope and that doesn't come from my own journeys right because i've had it easy for the most part in life if i had struggles sure but nothing on the order of magnitude of like holocaust survivors or what's going on in the ukraine or like people who survived air raids in yugoslavia in 1999. and like when i talk to those people when i talk to people who are first responders from 9 11 and when i talk to people who have fought in the iraq and afghanistan war and when i work with those people those are the people that inspire me and give me hope because i've seen it time and time and time again so if you're out there and you're listening and you're feeling hopeless i totally get it it's not my place to say that you shouldn't be hopeless and at the same time i can say that i have faith that it is possible for your life to be better tomorrow and that's something that i will completely stand behind that's it questions i guess yeah so this is a good question how should we think about our own struggles considering that there are people who are going through a war right now i know it sounds kind of weird but like trauma and struggling is not a competition so i've seen this unfortunately in like you know trauma therapy groups that i've run and stuff like that where sometimes there's like a competitive nature and the competitive nature can be like bad for both people so some people will invalidate their own trauma because someone else has been through worse and someone else will feel almost arrogant because i have the worst trauma therefore i am entitled to the most compassion i don't think that comparison of what we struggle with is useful at all right so like the struggles you what you're dealing with is legitimate it doesn't it doesn't change your life just because someone else is struggling with with something worse right so i mean i recognize i just made a comparison because i haven't lived through that so i can acknowledge that but it doesn't mean that like i'm not deserving of compassion just because someone else is going through some something else worse this is where i'd say that the way you should think about your own struggles is to like really really prioritize them because and i know it sounds weird but when people are going through a war this is where everyone who has it worse than you needs you to be the best that you can so that you can help them right if someone is like drowning if you can stand on firm footing and hold them that's way easier that's a way better chance to help another human being than if you're treading water right when my feet are firmly planted on the ground i can hold someone up but when i'm treading water it's so much harder to help another human being and so this is where i'd say like you should prioritize your struggles i'm not saying that you should do it to the exclusion of helping other people but this is where i want you to understand that you have a responsibility to the rest of humanity to get your in order because like we need you the human race needs you so get your in order as quickly as you can you don't need to be ashamed about it you shouldn't invalidate it and at the same time like you need to get it taken care of so do what you need to if that involves seeing a therapist that involves meditating every day that involves adjusting your diet going for long walks journaling whatever if involves getting a job involves moving out if it involves becoming financially successful whatever it takes you should prioritize yourself first and foremost and as you prioritize yourself recognize that the world may need you to help it but as long as you're trading water you don't have much to offer right you can offer something and that's where like even things like our community is really important like you can offer something even if you don't have your stuff together you can absolutely support someone else on discord you can absolutely you know play video games with someone and by the way there's also a really interesting study that shows that playing tetris after a traumatic experience actually can have positive effects in terms of trauma symptoms right so like it could be as simple as gaming with your friends right who are going through a tough time like there's a lot of ways you can support people so i'm not saying support other people but i'm it's very important to not de-prioritize yourself just because somewhat faceless person out there is struggling in their life that's why we need you to get your stuff together right that's what this community is about it's about becoming healthy because like that's the only way you can help other people right like you have to have capability you have to have power you have to have strength you have to have resilience then you can help the world great question does getting involved with the mmo guild count as getting involved with community i think to a certain degree absolutely right so there there's some research that shows that like online communities can be a healthy source of support and and i've even seen like i don't know how true these are i've seen like you know posts from 4chan and stuff about you know people forming deep connections with people in developing countries and like playing games together and stuff like that and i've heard you know i've heard a lot of stories about online communities being toxic and being the reason i'm stuck in life because i got lost in my wow guild i've seen relationships get destroyed through mmo communities like real life relationships i've seen divorces happen i've seen parents get frustrated i've seen people fail out of school because of mmo communities and i've seen the opposite i've seen people wake up every day and have something to look forward to it's the one bright point in their life when they're going through something bad their parents are going through a divorce mom or dad is an alcoholic it's the one safe place that i have and it can be both so like most things in life online communities are a tool and it is our choice as a community what kind of tool we want to be right do we want to be a health pot or do we want to be a poison potion do we want to engage in toxicity or do we want to engage in support it's our choice it's just a tool just like anything else is the internet a good thing or a bad thing is social media good or bad tons of studies about negative effects of social media and social media can be a huge force for good so it's down to you right okay so this is a good question so someone's asking how do secondary engagements make disengaging stress responses worse so let me clarify secondary engaging responses and disengaging responses are two separate things they don't make what they make worse is the stress response column on the far right so secondary engagement is adaptive things so it's dealing with the thing directly but in an adaptive and macro way so it's like making sense of my traumatic experience is a good example disengaging responses is not making sense of my traumatic experience it's ignoring my traumatic experience entirely right it's like pretending it didn't happen or engaging in wishful thinking so cognitive restructuring is an example of a secondary engaging coping strategy and avoidance is an example oh sorry avoidance is an outcome but denial is an example of a disengaging strategy so cognitive restructuring and denial are two very different things and it seems like secondary engaging strategies adaptive coping strategies are good at reducing things like numbness or re-experiencing or things like that whereas disengaging coping strategies seem to make the stress responses actually worse good question um so someone's asking do you believe group therapy is better than one-on-one therapy no so i think that the two things are different right it's like is an apple better than a banana no they're just different so oftentimes when i've worked clinically like all there'll be patients who will have group and individual therapy the two are just different so it's like is eldon ring better or is lost arc better well maybe you can make a you know a comment you could make a judgment there but this is where like the two are just different they can actually be complimentary uh so i'm gonna uh i'm gonna share a question that i see on on stream which how can you ukrainians abroad not go mad worrying about their families i don't know right so this is one of the times where i'm just gonna say i don't know i have no idea um you know if you are a ukrainian and you are worrying about your family like i think that's normal is it driving you crazy i imagine right and so this is where i'd say like as best as you can lean on whoever you can around you share your thoughts with someone so there's a there's a really important saying we have here at hg which is don't worry alone so i don't know that we can take your worries away but hopefully what we can do is help you not worry alone so you don't have to be alone in it right we can't fit like i can't wave a magic wand and make anyone's family safe in ukraine i wish i could but the most we can promise you is to like not worry alone and that's what community is about so besides avoiding exposure to trauma how can we do primary prophylaxis to prevent the development of ptsd these coping strategies sound like treatment in response to after getting ptsd so not exactly so let's understand this okay so there's treatment for ptsd so ptsd is a mental disorder it's a diagnosable clinical illness post-traumatic stress disorder that has certain evidence-based treatments so we need to understand is that outside of the clinical diagnosis people experience traumatic events and cope with those traumatic events so that doesn't that happens to like everyone right like so even minor traumas exist so if i go to school for example and like i wet my pants that's a minor traumatic experience and depending on how i cope with that i may never develop ptsd or i could develop ptsd who knows right and that's the key thing is what you do after the trauma how you deal with that in it to a certain extent determines whether you develop ptsd or not so this is where people are sort of saying like coping strategies sound like treatment in response to ptsd so that can be true so we can teach people so part of the treatment of ptsd is like developing healthy coping strategies so especially like in terms of addictions right so people that wind up with me are oftentimes using an unhealthy coping strategy like a substance but this is where like i want y'all to understand that trauma is more than a clinical illness like trauma is like a biological experience a psychological experience a human experience that bad things happen to humans and the way that we respond to those bad things the way that we deal with those bad things can determine how stressed what what the degree of our stress response is to the trauma that's the big takeaway so sure it could be a part of treatment of ptsd but the whole point is that like whether you have ptsd whether you get ptsd or not appears to a certain degree depend on how you cope with what happens to you how you find meaning how you deal with your emotions do you avoid do you integrate are you safe do you engage in community do you forgive do you hold on to anger do you seek justice do you get justice all of those factors go into whether someone has a clinical illness or not and this is sort of what was bizarre right it's like i have patients in my practice who have had traumatic experiences but don't have a diagnosis of ptsd right that's possible and so the cool thing is that the research seems to be elucidating what are the things that go into whether you wind up with ptsd or not and that's where there was one thing that i sort of didn't feel ready to talk about today but like was thinking about talking about it later if you guys are interested in this and that's that's where so there's a really interesting area of research called post-traumatic growth versus post-traumatic stress so this is where depending on a shared event like a common event it seems like their human beings will deal with that event differently and one will lead them towards post-traumatic growth and one will lead them towards post-traumatic stress which is the way in which you respond to the event and that in turn has to do with coping mechanisms it also has to do with personality traits and characteristics so the the research behind post-traumatic growth is very interesting so maybe we'll talk about that we all think pull post-traumatic growth versus stress yay so this is another great question what if it's really hard for me to manage with stress like there is war next to me and i have to pass school how am i supposed to do both things at once friend i have no idea dude honestly like i have no idea oh no i can't do it now i mean do you guys want to do it at all um because i i need to i need to prepare especially with the personality aspects that's the one area that i don't feel i want to do a thorough literature search so just to give you guys like a quick example i read one two three four five six seven i reviewed 19 papers like 17 or 19 papers in order to give this talk so we looked at like a ton of research so i've only read like five papers on post-traumatic growth so i don't feel like i can accurately represent it because i don't want to misrepresent things going back to the question of what if it's really hard for me to manage stress like there's war next to me and i have to pass a test do the best that you can right so that's what i'd say like meditate if you can take a walk if you can acknowledge your feelings maybe do some emotional expression and then do the best that you can this is also where i know it sounds kind of weird but like sometimes you have to accept that if in a particular circumstance you're not gonna you're not gonna be able to do well right so i think this is where oddly enough i'd try to forgive yourself for not being able to study for your test and this is where i'd also say like concretely like maybe talk to your teachers or parents and say hey i tried really hard to study for this but i literally like could not sleep last night and i'm terrified of what's happening nearby because i i can't imagine you're the only one right so this is where like it's important to make allowances for yourself and to ask for allowances from other people someone's asking what do you do with national guilt i have no idea man that's beyond my expertise okay all right should we meditate today okay so we'll we'll okay so we'll try to do maybe we'll try to do a post-traumatic growth stream okay so we're gonna do like super simple um yeah let's i assume yes i feel like we should so we're going to do like super simple meditation today so for anyone who's joining us uh who sees this right so i i'm maybe we're going to get a different population i want to teach you all a very very basic meditation technique called nari shuddhi or nadi shodhana or alternate nostril breathing or recently in the scientific literature it's been called cardiac coherence breathing so this is a breathing technique that has been shown to balance your sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous systems so your sympathetic nervous system is your stress and survival system your parasympathetic nervous system is your rest and digest system so if you're amped up this will kind of calm you down and if you're feeling tired or exhausted this will hopefully a few minutes after doing it kind of revitalize you i really sort of fell in love with this technique when i was working with people uh physicians and and other emergency room staff so in the emergency room i would teach meditation not to the patients but to the clinicians and staff and what we sort of found when i was talking to them about what would be the most useful and they would sort of say that okay so in bay one i have someone who just came in after a motor vehicle accident adrenaline through the roof paddles chest compressions blood transfusion kind of stuff and then in room number two i have a little old lady who has you know been nauseous and has a gi bug and like i need to like reset from the adrenaline to being like compassionate so i need some way to like balance like my adrenaline so this was the technique that i sort of used it worked really really well i like this technique because it you don't have to do it for long so you can do it for two or three minutes and it tends to have a pretty good effect if you're new to meditation it's very very easy to do the one contra indication is a deviated septum so if you have a deviated septum this this technique can be hard or even impossible to do and i don't recommend doing it so the technique is actually quite simple so we're going to sit up straight because anytime we want to meditate we want our spine and neck to be straight so you can even meditate on the ground if you want to you can lay down lay flat but we try to sit up straight we're going to take our hand and we're going to fold these two fingers down if that's hard for you or it ends up like this or something like this that's totally fine okay and then what we're going to do is block one nostril and breathe in through the other and then we're gonna block the other nostril and we're gonna breathe out through the opposite nostril and then we're gonna breathe in through this nostril switch and breathe out breathe in switch and breathe out breathe in switch and breathe out so after we exhale we're gonna inhale through the same nostril and the nostril that we breathe in from is not going to be the same nostril that we breathe out okay so it's in out in out in out okay so i'll toss in the switch so in switch out in switch out in switch out okay so it's also common for one of your nostrils to be more clogged than the other at any given time that's usually it's very normal so one of your nostrils will be more open one will be more closed and it'll alternate over time so every 90 minutes 45 to 90 minutes it should switch okay so let's go ahead and practice so sit up straight close your eyes or you can watch me if you need to we're going to adopt the mudra if this is hard for you you can also just use your index finger to switch back and forth if that's easier so we're going to block our right nostril and breathe in through our left switch and breathe out through your right nostril in through the right nostril switch and out through the left in through the same nostril switch and out in through the same nostril switch and out in switch out in switch out in switch out i'll guide you through one more round in switch out and now continue at your own pace for a period of about a minute or two we'll continue for about one more minute go ahead and finish the breath that you're on let your eyes remain closed relax your hands make sure you're sitting up straight and just float in this space when you're ready go ahead and come on back slowly so i know the world can be a scary place but as best as we can we're going to try to stay positive it's totally okay to acknowledge the fear the hopelessness the terror the uncertainty of the future and yet the most we can do is live one day at a time so that's what we're gonna do reach out for help or support if you can and for people in our community be prepared to support those and help those who ask for it and in terms of practicalities if you're learning this technique for the first time i'd recommend start with five minutes of practice and you want to eventually work your way up to 10 to 20 minutes of practice per day or three times a week at a minimum you can try other things in addition to this so you don't have to do 20 minutes of naughty should be you can do like five to ten minutes of nadi should be and then do a different kind of practice like a month or a practice or chanting practice or even silent meditation observation of the breath the goal is to really shoot for about 20 minutes of total practice so you can even do yoga for 10 minutes and naughty shoot you for 10 minutes if you want to and so that's what we sort of recommend in terms of time of the day i think dawn and dusk are ideal but oftentimes people find that doing it sometime in the morning or sometime before bed can be very helpful depending on what you're shooting for so if you're having difficulty sleeping doing meditation maybe about half an hour before sleep can be really good if you want to start off your day sort of in the right mindset meditation first thing in the morning can be really good but remember that this technique is actually particularly useful because it can be used midday if you want to try to calm yourself down or bring yourself up okay so i hope you enjoyed the technique i hope it's helpful for you and remember that practice makes perfect that meditation just like anything else is a skill so even if you didn't have a wonderful experience this time the more you practice it the better you'll get at it and the more mental benefit you'll get you
