and this is where people are like yeah i'd rather drive an 80s mazda than a ferrari as long as i can live with myself every day and i enjoy going to work because i've worked with people who drive the ferrari instead of the 80s mazda and what i hear from them uniformly is i wish i had made a career change 10 or 15 years ago because i'm sure i'm driving a ferrari but like i don't really care about it it doesn't bring me fulfillment what do you go by uh i'm chris nice to meet you chris and we're going to be talking about career stuff today right yes yes i am welcome buddy thank you thank you for having me on can i just say that you're my hero dr k okay um so yeah all right well yay i guess do you want to can we do you want to talk about career stuff or you want to talk about heroes sure no career stuff would be good okay so tell me how's your how's your career going how's your job going so i i've been doing marketing for like five to six years okay and i've been hating it a lot okay um i've been building startups here and there um i've been making um financial startups um startups for universities and startups for um students and stuff like that um but i've never really clicked that i like it and i've grown to the tested over the years okay of course i've detested that my coping mechanism is quite weird but i have like these side projects where i try to like listen to people more and really listen to myself in which i'm hoping that i would understand which career i i will i will like so basically i've been trying to be like a side psychologist for my friends like a therapist for five to six years and i've been loving that and um the last eight months have been the toughest because i i had really had to decide where i had to like to to go so i chose to drop all my businesses in like a week and then i i'm enrolling myself to a psychology university and i just started so cool how do you feel about that oh it feels scary it feels anxiety-inducing what's scary about it i'm afraid of so there's this idea that the first five to six years of my life of my career life was making was the idea that i'm making um the foundations for my future making startups um working in companies as a marketing intern sometimes a marketing um personnel and then suddenly i just dropped it all in less than a week the decision was like in less than a week i'm not so sure if i'm gonna make it i'm so afraid that i'm so afraid with the idea that i'm not gonna make it as a therapist okay what what does not making it as a therapist mean to you okay so i've been um the last two months i've been making um a support thread in hg's community and hg's um discord server where i receive call-ins from people which i don't diagnose or treat them or coach them or anything all i do is just listen okay like the way you would teach everyone in twitch how to listen to really like reflect and sometimes there are some people from the united states or people who are really fluent in english in which i can't really understand how to speak better so i'm really afraid if i'm not gonna be able to like understand people that's my worst fear okay and becoming a therapist um i don't mind not being able to help people but i am very afraid of not being to understand people so that makes sense yeah i think it makes a lot of sense so what i'm hearing is that you try to support people on the internet and some of your interactions with those people have made it have started to cr has started to create doubt in your mind that hey if i can't help these people what if that means that i can't help people as a psychologist or a therapist exactly so i think that that's this is going to be a you know maybe a rare situation where um i don't know that this is a deep psychological exploration i think that this may actually have a very simple answer we'll see how this answer sits with you okay so the first thing to understand is that when you're in a therapist or when you're a therapist or psychologist there's there are things that are very very very different about that from talking to a stranger on the internet and i think this is where if you fail to help people who are strangers on the internet that has so much to do with the way in which you're interacting with them and very little similarity to what a psychologist or therapist does so like sure you know and and so oddly enough like i'm not surprised that you run into trouble trying to help people on the internet because i think first of all there's no longitudinal relationship so success as a therapist or psychologist tends to involve a longitudinal relationship now there are other places in which we have longitudinal relationships right so like for example we can have friends we can have gaming buddies things like that so even if i struggle with friendships it doesn't mean that i'm not going to be a good therapist the other thing is that it sounds like you've learned a lot kind of on your own but you actually haven't gone through formal education no i haven't right so if i like want to be a chef and i'm afraid that i'm not going to be making good food but i haven't started culinary school yet like that's kind of valid right so so oddly enough i think part of part of what's going on here is that you know as you go through your formal education process because remember the goal of the education is to teach you how to be successful as a therapist but you haven't done that yet so i personally am not concerned like i because i think helping people on the internet is like kind of a grab bag because a lot of times there are all kinds of things that could be going on and listening is often not sufficient to help people it's a great place to start but as a therapist and as a psychologist you're going to learn so much more than listening so what i'm sort of is seeing you do is sort of like you're you're making an assessment which is kind of fair because it's your experience but it's like you haven't been trained in this stuff you've really only learned step one it's like i'm teaching you how to turn on the oven but you're like i don't know how to bake a cake yet and it's like yeah that's because all i've taught you is how to turn on the oven so i think there's some basic communication skills that we try to teach and the reason we teach those basic communication skills is because they're you know do therapists learn those skills yes but these are skills that all human beings should understand in terms of communication and as you go through formal education for therapy or psychology or whatever you're going to learn way more than what we teach what do you think about that how does that sit with you kind of makes me more afraid okay because the idea that um if listening like the i mean the the the thing that i really understand in a therapist's job is to 80 of the job is to listen if i can't do that then what am i going to do where do you get the idea that 80 percent of the job the therapist's job is to listen well i i i right okay um i've been in the therapist's office i guess i've seen you interview people so that's my main idea okay so you've been in therapy yourself yes and your therapist listens to you a lot right yes what do you think when they're not speaking what do you think they're doing diagnostic assessments sort of right so i would say that most of the therapists job we are listening when we're doing therapy but actually i'd say most of our job is thinking what do you think about that that makes me feel safe i guess because i like thinking a lot yeah i know yeah yeah so so i think chris what i'm hearing from you is that you're someone who's learned how to be a good listener but really to understand what a therapist does it's like we're thinking a lot right so even as i'm talking to you i'm listening to what you're saying maybe it'll help if i share with you what's going on in my mind okay so like i'm trying to figure out okay is this fear that you have like appropriate or inappropriate is it developmentally appropriate and what i mean by developmentally appropriate is they're like some think there's some fears that if i've never been on a date before and i've never had a significant other before if i've never been in a committed romantic relationship it's developmentally appropriate for me to be afraid of that does it mean that there's something wrong with me absolutely not in fact it's a normal part of the developmental process so i'm also sort of thinking a little bit about like as i'm listening to you i'm also thinking about okay like we talked a lot about marketing at the beginning or marketing has been your background is the fear that you experience now somehow related to marketing or is the fear that you experience a some scar that has to do with your own fear of uncertainty are there other things that i could ask you about like for example how much of this fear is you've invested five or six years and now you've you've given up everything that you've invested and now you're like going all in on becoming a psychologist what if you're a bad psychologist too then what then like you've given up all this career and now you're like eight years down the road you've given up your career you're a bad psychologist like now what do you do oh my god you're screwed does that any of that resonate with you like i think about that every day really for the past month so so here's the question chris the consequence of you giving up a career in marketing and pursuing psychology and being bad at it is huge like it's gonna cost you a lot but just because it's gonna cost you a lot doesn't mean that you're that has nothing to do with whether you're good or bad at it does that make sense if you're bad at it you're screwed we have no idea whether you're good about it exactly and that makes it very scary right yeah so i think that that's developmentally appropriate i think you've taken you've taken a plunge you've jumped off a cliff and you're not sure how you're going to land there's a lot of uncertainty that i'm hearing exactly what i'm seeing down there is like rocks and dirt there's some water in it it's just very scary yeah yeah and and so what do we do with fear exactly what do you do with fear it's a good thing what do you think like is the goal to make the fear go away no it's too it's to experience the fear while going towards the thing that i really want and do you really want to be a therapist yes like it's such a weird thing i have this instance where i can can i tell you why i think i'm really gonna be uh why my passion is in there absolutely tell me a therapist sure okay so there's like this um meeting where where where there's this like um one room filled with ceos startup owners and business owners and stuff like that and then there's just this one psychologist who's just there sitting and taking notes and then talking to people just saying that i don't know why but i got a hint that she's a clinical psychologist and i'm more interested in talking with her than anyone in the group and that keeps happening over and over again so i think that's why maybe that's a stupid idea but do you think it's a stupid idea i mean logically yes because i'm basically giving up a lot of money a lot of certainty a lot of like um stability in marketing to go to be a therapist who in indonesia i am from indonesia who which is a third world country and psychologists and therapists aren't really the dream job for indonesians and mental health is such a big stigma here still giving up a ferrari for an 80s mazda sure yeah so how do you feel about that i feel afraid i'm constantly thinking that i'm stupid for thinking about it i know for for choosing for for for loving the idea that i get to have conversations with people every day what's happening with them okay so what did you detest or hate about marketing the manipulation the idea that i need to push products create value out of nothing to sell to people okay i don't like that idea so chris i think you've got so oddly enough i kind of agree with you that on some level becoming a therapist and giving up a career in marketing is stupid and yet yeah i mean because you've made a good argument right sure i still think you're doing the right thing but kind of meet you where you're at so i i think this is where it what matters like i think what you've got to really decide is what what do you value so i'm going to give you two choices you can have a career that has more certainty more money and manipulates other people into buying stuff that they they don't need or you can have a career that you find intellectually intriguing fulfilling more uncertainty uphill battle helping people in a country the same reason it's a risky business to be a psychologist in indonesia is also exactly why like i don't know how old you are but i'm guessing you're in your 20s and so you've got to think about over 40 years would the world be a better place if indonesia had a psychologist who actually cared about what they were doing and we're trying to help people who struggle with mental health problems in indonesia what matters to you more and so that's why i think it sounds like you're making the right choice now is there more uncertainty absolutely is it a question mark absolutely but that's where also i think it's like this is your time in life to really think about do i want to play it safe or am i willing to make a risk take a risk to make the world a better place and also like i may lose out financially ironically in my experience it's people who make the choice that you made actually end up both happier and richer because what i tend to see is that when people hate their job they perform underperform and when people love their job they over perform and also the lower value societally when society thinks that a particular profession isn't worth very much if you really care about it you do really really well like i don't know how to say this but like i'll share a story with you so when i was in medical school i was on my surgery rotation and i did a good job on surgery and then i people towards the end of it they were like hey you know like if you really wanted to do surgery like you'd be really good at it you should really consider going doing surgery and i told them and i was like hey i'm you know i'm interested in psychiatry and their response was you're too smart for psychiatry you're wasted in psychiatry you're you're so smart and you're so talented that you should do something that is really going to challenge you and that's like that's surgery and what i really found is that like that was sort of arrogant but that that oddly enough you know just because there's a low value profession that is not very competitive if you're really really strong at it and you care about it a lot a lot you're going to shine very brightly in that profession because i i don't know i mean like because i i think that the key thing is that you know i think it is an uphill battle and what i'm hearing from you is that there's more financial uncertainty but like i don't know how to say this but something tells me in the next 20 years psychologists are going to be valued a lot more in indonesia than they are today what do you think okay sure i yeah it's just the from year 0 to the 20th year is gonna be such a long long time i was planning a year ago that i would be living off my own probably having my own house now probably expanding my startup and stuff like that but now i'm stuck in my parents house like i'm not so sure what to do with that it it's stupid it feels stupid because i'm burdening a lot of more people than than weighing myself to be happier that makes sense yeah so chris what i'm hearing is that i don't know how to say this but like yeah like you know you're taking a step back the road of life but i think that like sometimes that's still the right move right even if you have to stay i mean you have to decide because you're telling me that this is a job that you detested and that you know you hated manipulating people so like sure you could have your own place but you would still be manipulating people and detesting it every day and i i don't know how to say this but just like from a karmic perspective like a career shift is gonna come at a cost is there more uncertainty yeah like i wish i could tell you hey everything's great you know you're gonna be perfect i mean i i think you're gonna i think you're it sounds to me like you're operating from the right principles and this is the other thing about life is like we can't know what's gonna happen like we don't know right like maybe if you continue to manipulate people through marketing and you're working with all these startup ceos one of them does something illegal gets sent to jail you get sent to jail like you have no idea what what the future is going to hold we have these assumptions that certain things are very secure and other things are insecure but if anything the world has taught us anything over the last three years with like a global pandemic it's that the world can come grinding to a halt and so i think the the you know the reason that i'd kind of support you and your decision is first of all we've had clients from indonesia and we've heard firsthand from them how hard it is to find a good therapist or psychologist second thing is i think you're operating from the right place the tricky thing is that just because you operate from the right place does not mean that life is going to be easy right are you going to be staying at home for a couple of years yeah are you gonna make less money sure is there more uncertainty sure when you tell people oh i do marketing for this startup and they're like oh like very impressive and then when you say like i'm a therapist and you live in a country where that isn't valued they're like what's wrong with you yeah exactly like my friends asked me what's wrong with you yeah okay yeah right so i mean i got that stuff too when i decided to become a psychiatrist from the surgeons and also people in my family they're like why would you want to be a psychiatrist you're going to go crazy so like i don't know how to say this but you know chris i i can't tell you that your life is going to be easy because of your decisions but what i can tell you is that if you want to live a fulfilling life it's not always taking the easy road and that do what aligns with you and do your best and try to make the world a better place and i would you know if i had if i was a betting man i would say if we talk to you five years from now i don't think you're gonna regret your decision i see a lot more regret from people who stay in the field that they find spiritually bankrupt and this is where people are like yeah i'd rather drive an 80s mazda than a ferrari as long as i can live with myself every day and i enjoy going to work because i've worked with people who drive the ferrari instead of the 80s mazda and what i hear from them uniformly is i wish i had made a career change 10 or 15 years ago because i'm sure i'm driving a ferrari but like i don't really care about it it doesn't bring me fulfillment and that's where if material goods are very very fulfilling to you then that's a different story i think it's it's about values chris it's about what you care about yeah it's just it's really hard to cope to it's really hard to understand how to cope living the data the day-to-day basis that's the hardest one what's harder on a day-to-day basis um hold on um i'm not like i i i feel guilty a lot towards my parents they have to pay again for my tuition and i have to keep living off them in which they had more plans for themselves but i have to pull them back again and it feels like i can't i i'm really proud of what i'm trying to achieve of myself but when i put myself in society or like in with friend groups or with um big family gatherings or stuff like that that kind of makes me shameful yeah to to burden my parents so much that's what i feel like from the career change yeah no i don't know how to cope with that have you talked to your parents about it yes and they keep i i'm trying to like really talk to them about it but they keep reassuring yeah it's okay like it doesn't feel okay because sometimes i can like feel their disappointment almost that's what i'm feeling okay okay to disappoint them it's not okay at all oh feelings emotions hello hold on because i failed a lot i failed a lot yeah by trying to go to marketing like i i tried to like abolish the failures that i did from when i was in high school and when i was in when i was trying to apply for universities i applied when i was in high school i applied to 50 french universities i worked hard a lot and then i failed and i i spent like eight months there and i had to go home because no universities would because my bad french for some reason but i aced all of them okay and um yeah yeah i'm sorry it got emotional it's okay i think we're learning a couple of things you failed right and a bunch of times in in order to and failure comes with negative emotions sure and as you start acting in a way to make the negative emotions go away right to abolish the failure make up from the failure you wind up in marketing it's also my choice like it's a dumb choice six years ago sure let's table that for a second but what i'm kind of what i what i'm hurt what i heard from you is that you experienced some degree of failure and you had to make up for it and so you chose marketing and then as you started working in marketing did you feel less like a failure kinda yeah okay good so you started you started to take actions to make yourself to fix feelings yeah does that make sense right because if i feel like a failure oh i can do marketing and look like i'm in a room with a bunch of ceos i'm no longer a failure with me yep so what you've managed to do is try to do certain things that make you feel less bad and where did that get you and are you happy with where you are no okay so sometimes we are so afraid of negative feelings that we will do whatever we can to make them go away and in doing so we oftentimes trap ourselves because then what happens is like you're you can't experience that shame or feeling of failure or whatever so you're gonna make action so you never feel that way it's a protective mechanism but in doing so what you're actually doing is you're letting that fear of failure dictate your life does that make sense kinda yeah what do you understand about that and what do you not understand about that i get that i'm trying to like feel something overcompensate something that's the right word yep i i get that i'm trying to do that but i never felt like it was the the the wrong choice sure at the start and when i'm doing it absolutely it's not going to feel like the wrong choice because how do we know what's the wrong choice and what's the right choice based on our emotions that's our first answer right if i do something and i feel like a failure that's the wrong choice if i do something else and i don't feel like a failure that's the right choice and so you've picked a career to avoid feeling like a failure but avoiding the emotion of feeling avoiding an emotion of shame is not a good strategy to live a fulfilling life this is where things get tricky does that make sense like if i'm trying to avoid feeling ashamed of myself so let's say i feel ashamed when i go to a party because i'm short i'm like five foot two and everyone else is like five foot six or five foot seven i feel ashamed of myself so what can i do to avoid that shame i just never go to a party and that feels good over the course of that day because if i go to the party i feel ashamed of myself if i don't go to the party i don't feel ashamed of myself easy right i just avoid the party sometimes we see this in careers too where like you felt like a failure so you've got to make up for it and then you start living this life to try to look good in other people's eyes and feel good about yourself and you do that for five or six years and then you end up kind of where you are which is that you recognize that you picked a profession that feels like unethical in some way it doesn't resonate with who you are as a person you're not helping anyone you don't find the work quite as interesting and in fact you're even a little bit afraid that you could be manipulating people in the wrong direction but you get to hold your head up high you get to move out from your parents place you get to drive a ferrari so what's more important to you chris this may sound weird but i guess not being disappointed not disappointing my parents like that really is a very important thing for me absolutely so now we get to something else so you ask your parents am i disappointing you what do they say no no it's fine everything's good you're good okay so let's take two scenarios and you don't believe them right okay so let's take two scenarios in two alternate universes one universe your parents are disappointed in you and in another universe they're not disappointed in you in the universe that they are disappointed in you what are they gonna say are they gonna tell you they're disappointed i don't think so no they're gonna say no no no no chris it's okay we love you we're not disappointed and in the universe where they're not disappointed and they actually are okay with it what are they gonna say no no no chris you're okay absolutely they're gonna say the same damn thing so how are you supposed to know which one is real exactly how do i know right so my point is that they may not actually be disappointed in you but there's no way that you're gonna know because even if they tell you they're not disappointed in you you're not willing to believe them so how are they ever supposed to convey to you actually chris this is okay so why do human beings do this it's because you're disappointed in yourself so if i think i'm ugly and the world tells me no no you look fine i don't believe them so concretely i mean i think you've got a fair amount of work so you know for what it's worth i think it's fine that you decided to move into psychology i think it's great i think it's a wonderful profession i think hopefully you'll be helping people in a couple of years i think if you enjoy the work and it resonates like if you care about being the psychologist in the room of ceos and by the way that also is like respectable right because now we have psychologists in rooms with ceos and executives and other people are recognizing the value of psychology but i think you've got some work ahead of you which is like to really think a little bit about you know your own feelings of disappointment and failure and i could tell you all kinds of stuff like as a parent you recognize that your children are going to make mistakes that it's your job as a parent to support your kids when they make mistakes that as a parent you're actually okay with them living with you for a year or two if it makes them happy like what do your parents want they want you to be happy they want you to be safe they want you to be secure i would not be happy if my kids were driving around ferraris and were were miserable every day if someone came and asked me hey would you be willing to set delay your retirement plans by two years if it means that your child was happy with their career for the rest of their life i'd be like damn straight i'd take that trade any day of the week what do you think never really thought about it that way i guess so yeah right so i just oh yeah go ahead yeah how do i deal with my own disappointment towards myself i guess okay good question so a couple of things the first is you can have more of a conversation with your parents so when you ask them are you disappointed in me and they say what do they say no no it's fine everything's good why are you asking this again and what do you say well it's just i i usually get angry like yeah just listen to me for a bit just like really listen you know like tell me oh no i mean let me convey my feelings and they're like what what is it again what is it what's their left to convey okay so so i think there are a couple of things which are unfortunate which is that western cultures are increasingly what we call psychologically minded whereas my experience of people in southeast asia east asia south asia africa you know we don't it's kind of confusing like my parents like thoughts and emotions are kind of confusing like even now when i talk to the generation above me they actually don't know the difference between a thought and an emotion like if i were to ask one of my aunts or uncles or one of my friend's parents what are you feeling right now they would not be able to answer that question they would tell me what they're thinking but they like literally don't know how to detect a particular emotion if i point it out to them they can they can recognize it but so there's just a there's like a cultural gap and understanding gap there second thing to consider is that i would ask your parents why aren't you disappointed have you ever asked them that right yeah no right so like i feel disappointed in myself can you help me understand why you aren't disappointed like how do you understand like what's going on in my life like when you see me like what do you see what do you think my difficulties are you know do you think i'm doing a good job do you think i'm doing a bad job and the last thing that i'd say is you know how do you deal with the disappointment and i i don't know how else to say this is someone who you know i mean i started i haven't asked you how old you are but you know i'm guessing mid to late 20s ish yeah 24. okay okay so i mean you're starting your career you're starting your education as a psychologist the age of 24 right so and i started my career i started my education as a medical doctor at the age of 27 or 28. i turned 28 like one month after i started med school and what i can tell you being on the other side is it's like absolutely worth it and it's actually okay to feel like a failure it's okay to be disappointed in yourself and like it's okay to not know how to live life right at the beginning and that it takes us a while to figure things out and sometimes we make mistakes but it's through mistakes that we understand things and as we understand things as we start to struggle ourselves and overcome our struggles it doesn't happen right away it's that understanding which when we try to help other people makes us heroes in their eyes okay what do you think about that i mean logically sure the emotion still lasts like on a day-to-day basis like it doesn't stop so yeah so i mean i do feel good i do feel less anxious i do feel less depressed i don't feel like i don't i don't i i can't look myself in the mirror again and say that you you're doing good like that's something like that that i that i did three months and that was awesome to feel but the idea that i have to go through school again with people who don't even know what life is at 17 they're they're they're starting out college at 17 and i'm 24 i'm basically seven years older like that i mean yeah like i i have no words put to this i'm really sorry about that i hope i get it on i guess i get it because i i did the same right so i i went to school with a bunch of 22 year olds when i was 28. and what i actually learned was kind of interesting it's actually way easier so you feel ashamed for being older but that experience is gonna like be at least for me it was i realized like as soon as i stopped comparing myself in terms of ages what i realized is that stuff bothered them that didn't bother me because i had actually been out into the real world and i knew what what mattered right like i had failed and so what happened is i had all these colleagues who were like terrified of getting a b because they thought that was failure like i had actually failed that was like a b a no one's gonna kick me out of school with a b and so they were so stressed out for getting a b and i was like you know it'd be nice if i got an a but i'm still i got into med school i'm moving on my path i'm probably going to be a doctor one day as long as i don't screw it up and like that's what's really important to me and i mean it's hard chris because i think that like the challenge here is that i see that you're suffering a lot you feel a lot of guilt you feel a lot of shame i'm also hearing that you can be proud of yourself and i don't know how to say this but first of all i don't think that there's anything i can say today that'll make all those negative feelings go away and the second thing is that i don't want to make those negative feelings go away i think that i think that what's gonna make you an amazing psychologist and therapist is actually having gone through this stuff it's not just that you care about other people it's that you know what it is to feel shame you know what it is to feel like a failure and you can't see this now but i sort of can you know 10 years from now you're going to be in your office and a 22 year old kid 24 year old kid is going to come into your office and they're going to say i work in marketing and i absolutely hate it but i feel too guilty to leave and you're going to be able to help that person because of your own struggles and your own suffering and like when i think about you know what's made me the person that i am today i wouldn't go back and change anything because i understood so much through my own struggles it's like it's valuable information and the good news is that you will get better at it right you say that you look in the mirror and you can feel proud of yourself and you still feel ashamed less great but like i don't think that's a bad thing i think that's part of your journey that's part of your growth you know we we become the people that we are not just through our successes but also through our failures and this is hard because in in indonesian society you know i'm making some assumptions here but i know some of the culture like failure isn't a good thing in any way shape or form we you just don't think about it that way right it's just there's successes you have the better you are and you live in a society where like they judge you like that which is why which is exactly why it's going to be so important because 10 years from now there are going to be tons of kids who are growing up in that same society who are going to feel like absolutely nothing because they failed and they're going to need a therapist who understands that the downside is that you have to suffer through this in order to help those people at least that's been my experience and my journey i mean your journey may be different but at least on the bright side like after what eight years i get to be called dr k as well sure great yeah yeah i think i i do understand now i i understand better i guess i i can't say that that's way better now than the first time we said hello so yeah and i mean i think it's you know you've got some deep stuff down there chris and that's like it's i don't know what i'll say man it's it's okay like this is just your journey and it's gonna have uncertainty and like you know i may be good at particular things but i i can't look into the future and tell you everything is going to be okay i mean i have faith that it will and the last thing is i would seriously like consider talking to your parents about why don't they think that you're a failure like if you can stomach that conversation and even if they say and this is the most challenging thing is that we don't want to be a disappointment but what's actually healthier than that is being a disappointment and being okay with it because it's life like no one's perfect thanks man i think i'm going to need it okay adios bye-bye thanks for calling in yeah i mean it's tough you know like we just have to be careful because a lot of times what we want to do is avoid negative emotions and we think that we're doing the right thing in life because we don't feel bad about it living a life in which we avoid negative emotions isn't necessarily going to lead us to happiness and that's the most confusing thing and the reason that it's like it's okay to make those kinds of mistakes is because no one ever explains it to us like that right like does anyone did anyone sit down with chris and ask him why are you going into marketing did they have these heart-to-heart discussions what does it feel like to you know spend eight months trying to get into french universities and failing to get in like what's driving you to choose this does that anyone sit down and ask you these kinds of questions so that you can understand no of course not so we live life on autopilot and the destination is the avoidance of negative emotion at all costs it's how we pick careers it's how we pick relationships it's how we stay in relationships that we shouldn't stay in it's why we use drugs so you have got to really be critical about why are we trying to do this you know what are we trying to avoid here and like i know it sounds kind of weird but the more that we embrace negative emotion we're not saying go out there and try to create as much negative emotion as possible what i'm saying is that align your decisions based on what you really care about and don't let pain suffering fear or shame get in the way of you moving towards what you care about you
