this is a place where we want you to build a life that's worth living and then go live that life that's actually the mission of this community i want to tell y'all something that's super cool that's going on so um we recently started something called the touch grass campaign on our discord channel and like sometimes i've seen posts recently or i see these posts a lot on on the internet about like you know people like upset me on the internet and so what people will sort of do is they'll say like okay go touch bro go touch grass right so like people on the internet and the way that people respond to each other on the internet is not actually real life that perspective i think is a little bit simplistic because i think actually what's happening is the internet is becoming real life so this is where for example if you look at dating like dating apps are actually replacing in-person interactions in the first stage of relationships so what we decided to do is some awesome people on our discord and in our community this is their brainchild decided to put together a campaign in the month of july to help our community go out and do stuff so i can stream on twitch and i can we can you can watch videos on youtube and all that good stuff and you can learn about yourself but at the end of the day it's still you sitting in front of a screen even in terms of that's part of the reason that we developed a coaching program is because like we wanted to help people actually work through their individual problems and like figure out okay what's going on with your motivation set goals for yourself hold yourself accountable figure out you know what is your ego what is your identity that gets in the way of things like do all of that individual kind of deep work so we developed a coaching program the thing is those are like two ends of the spectrum even in terms of coaching there's a shortcoming right because at the end of the day let's say you spend one hour a week with your coach they're formulating goals you're developing a game plan you're sort of executing on some of that stuff but like it's still one hour a week with your coach there are a lot of health benefits to doing things like going out plant aerosols can be good for feelings of anxiety you know vitamin d deficiency can make you more vulnerable to covid and make you more vulnerable to depression so at some point we got to get people to go out and do things and so that's what the touch grass campaign is about and so what i want to do for a few minutes is actually share with y'all some of this stuff so this is our submissions channel for the touch grass campaign and what we wanted to let me see yeah it's it's over here is like so the touch grass campaign involves um it's a essentially a photo challenge to get people going outside and basically like the ranked number one on the leaderboard at the end of the contest gets a merch store gift card um free access to dr k's guide i guess i'm gonna sign a secret item for them and um top five on the leaderboard get free access as well the other thing is i think a uh um our winner randomly picked at the end of the contest also gets all of the above rewards so there's like number one on the leaderboard and a random winner so if you just participate at all there's a chance you can win a number one rule of the challenge is pixie or it didn't happen um you don't have to show your face right so we want to preserve anonymity please don't edit pictures things like that but i just want to show you all the submissions so this is what i love about our community i wish this is some way i can zoom in how do you zoom into discord okay so like someone cleaned their room like this is fantastic i don't know exactly what this is a picture of i guess it's watch the sunset but that's pretty cool someone is petting something um someone got a new haircut congratulations someone touched grass great go on a long walk awesome meditate in the park fantastic um completed vibe to music in the park also fantastic go on a long walk cool right uh find street art awesome and the thing is like i don't know if you guys can see this i guess you

local museum okay that looks like quite the museum my point here is that like so i love this challenge uh it's it's one of our so i think for some reason like our discord has really been like our mods and team on discord have really been doing an awesome job recently and like this is so if we want to put together our lives we've got to meet you where you're at and that's on the internet but the goal of coming to this stream and like being a part of this community is to actually leave that's the goal right and if there's one thing that separates us from a cult it's that we don't the goal is to actually leave and maybe that you know this is what we want like we're here to help you i i'm here to help you in whatever way that i can educate you i guess and then like at some point though you all have to go out and start living your life right and we're not asking you to leave anytime soon so hang around for a little while maybe pay it forward a little bit but this is a place where we want you to build a life that's worth living and then go live that life that's actually the mission of this community and when we started it we were like trying to figure out like some kind of new like cool name like oh my god like let's come up with like neuro brain mind champ champ neuro there's like there was like a set of prefixes and suffixes that we could use when we were trying to figure out okay what are we going to be but at the end of the day we're not sort of like an abstinence only sort of perspective right it's like technology can be a healthy part of your life but it should be a part of your life it shouldn't be all of your life and what we love to do more than anything else is help you build a life that's worth living and whether if you're at the point where you can't clean your room that's actually totally fine if all you can do is listen to some guy talk on the internet if we can sort of like if you're just watching youtube videos or whatever just like sitting around like listening to stream hopefully we can influence you a little bit that way that's totally fine if you're not ready to go out and do something don't go out and do something and at some point if you're ready to do a little bit more join our discord if you're some at some point you're ready to do a little bit more go out and touch grass do parts of this touch grass challenge we're not going to get anything out of it there's something the only thing that people are going to get out of it is what you put into it this this touch grass challenge is a chance for you to go and look at the night sky and get away from all of these screens and just look up at the sky that human beings have been looking up at that same sky for literally millions of years there is a piece of history out there who knows what else is out there right we have like like these cool telescopes that are getting us new pictures now and stuff like that like who knows what's out there but you can look out there and you can wonder at that just the way that everyone else does and then what so and so tweeted and how someone responded and all that kind of stuff it all becomes less important when you're just like stargazing and what's happened is that our life has been dominated by like artificial stuff we as a society have been taught that a lot of stuff is important that actually isn't important right so and so got banned from twitter this thing happened on twitter like that's not real life and so we try to teach that to you all through meditation right that's where you can some connect with yourself a little bit we've got stuff like this on discord for those of you that are really interested in in sort of developing like a concrete plan and figuring out what you are when you're really ready for a higher level of self-work that's why we have a coaching program right so we recognize that some people are just at the you know i'm just like kind of like curious about it i don't want to commit to anything i don't want to do anything i just want to learn which is totally fine some of y'all are at the stage where like okay i want to do a little bit more which is what discord is for and for people who are interested in sort of going you know like really sort of figuring out okay i need someone's help and i'm willing to put in time and energy on a week to week basis to improve our life that's what coaching is for we also have dabbling kind of stuff too so the social sandbox on our discord is one of the best events that we've ever had just super cool so this is like a place that you can go that's run by an hg coach completely free by the way and just a chance for you all to learn about communication skills and practice communication skills so if you're just like struggling to be a better communicator or you're shy or you just need practice with strangers on the internet before you go out in the real world that's why we have programs like that or workshops like that i guess is a better way to put it so we're doing what we can but at the end of the day we can only do so much and the most important person in this process is actually you so what are you going to do you're going to go out and touch grass you're going to meditate today good luck you
