right so like you can't have an identity logically like you can never discover yourself through logic who you are is experiential on its fundamental level and you started the interview with you know what do you do when your work becomes your identity like that's a logical exchange right so i can bucket you based on your profession but that's not really who you are like that's the whole point of this discussion so when you're operating from this upper level of like this is not who i am i'm more than my work whatever like you can try to you can talk about it until you're blue in the face but you're never going to discover yourself that way welcome friend thank you so much for coming on today thank you for having me um so tell me a little bit about what do you what do you go by or how do you want to be called or addressed today yeah sure andy is fine andy okay so welcome andy and is there something in particular that you want to talk about or anything that we can help you with today andy uh yeah sure so uh i could probably sum it up by someone somewhere said um the problem with society now is that when people ask you what you do they're asking who you are and i'd probably identify with that so i don't really have a self outside of my career okay and that's kind of slowly dawning on me as time goes on you don't have a self outside of your career so i've done a bit of homework right so i watched a couple of a couple more videos than usual i'm not a i've not watched everything um [Music] and a couple of things stood out for me so you kind of had a thought exercise i think um you know asking what do you enjoy what do you what do you what interests you what do you do for fun when was the last time you were intellectually engaged uh i don't i can't really remember outside of work okay which is probably are the problem okay and is this distressing for you in some way uh yeah yeah so i don't i guess i don't have a a me i don't have an identity and in terms of so i kind of i'm just floating down the river opportunities are coming my way through hard work and i take them because that's the way the river's flowing you've said things like this i think in the past about you know being an analyst and then blah blah blah you're a exec yep um and that's fine and so that's what i'm doing but it seems a bit hollow so it's like if i was playing skyrim but i was just learning how to be a blacksmith and there was infinite levels of blacksmithing so i'm just i keep doing it and there's this whole world there but i need the next level of blacksmithing and oh when does it end why doesn't you just kind of die one day and what was your level of blacksmithing what was your career position it's kind of totally irrelevant got it so i'm i'm kind of hearing you say that you know you you're climbing a ladder but it's sort of like a ladder to nowhere and there are a lot of other things to do besides going like kind of straight up like you can go north south east east west you can sail you can hike but you're not doing any of those things you're just climbing a ladder yeah pretty much and the thing that's stopping me uh seems quite simple isn't it so just work less and figure out what you'd like to do when i work less i get anxious really anxious i think you know well i don't deserve the job that i have i i'll never get the next step if i don't keep working and part of this comes from i mean i say it a lot to different people what frustrates me is there'll be a problem and i might solve it eighty percent and it frustrates me that there was probably a perfect set of actions or words that would allow me to solve the problem completely for any any scenario in the world right whatever it is and so i try to kind of outwork the that issue because someone is smarter and they'll get 85 and someone else is quicker and they'll get 90 how do you feel when have you ever gotten 100 uh yeah i've been 100 happy with you know solutions yeah yeah and how does that feel uh yeah like i put the work in and got 100 yeah that's what you did that's yeah how does that feel uh like a relief okay do you feel pride [Music] no no no really okay relief for perfection so when you when you act perfectly or well it's not perfection but it's the closest human equivalent that andy can attain yeah and you feel relief okay like i worked my deficits whatever they are for whatever the problem is or i did reas that was that was good so i worked whatever the deficits might be lack of experience or whatever it is you know so you had certain shortcomings and you overcame them uh yeah yeah it does everyone does really everyone has shortcomings yeah yeah does everyone overcome them no i'm not overcoming them all the time i guess that's the problem it's kind of this hollow pursuit what's hollow about it well so uh what's all about it is i'm not happy how do you know you're not happy [Music] um because i feel the opposite okay tell me about that help me understand that what do you feel uh well like i don't know who i am i i don't have anything to offer personally you know i have a partner for seven years and work interferes with that and workers interfered with other relationships and you know ruins them and other stuff as well you know it's not i'm glad i'm with you i'm weird i don't have any regrets about not being with people in the past but i'm not a very good partner you know isn't that a problem you can work on uh yeah it is but the i'm compelled to remain industrious and keep keep keep keep my foot on the pedal what compels you to do that i don't know it's like emotion okay how are you feeling right now andy uh yeah fine i noticed he started smiling somewhere in there yeah i don't know i just you just asked me why i was compelled but i think you know that's i'm trying to say compelled because i don't know it's just a automatic i think it's a very good word i think it's a i'm getting that vibe from you that you're not really in control but you're moving like you're the one who's doing the moving you're just not sure why like i don't get the sense that you're actually floating down a river i think you're there's a river that's moving in a direction it's super shallow and you're actually walking down the river yeah yeah floating down the river sounds quite relaxing doesn't it yeah i don't think that's exactly what's going on yeah there's a certain swimming pool i don't know uh does it feel like swimming upstream or swimming downstream upstream i'm never gonna get you know it it's that it's infinite isn't it you know there's always there's always another promotion or another step on the career ladder so you know you yeah it's against the current yeah yeah so you're unhappy yeah i know it's gonna be a weird hard question how do you know uh because i feel [ __ ] sometimes and then i kind of get busy again ah i see so tell me about what you feel when you're feeling bad like what is it like how if i were to be telepathic or some could somehow inject my consciousness into your experience what would feeling [ __ ] look like what would i see is it thoughts is it physical sensations is it it's like a it's like an emptiness through a sense of kind of wasting your existence in the world and you know you might have different views but you know for me just one life so you need to kind of live it and then i don't know how you know and i haven't i don't have any passions really i'm passionate when i'm at work i'm really passionate and really empathetic and i put in the hours to help my team and try and make it try and change the culture and improve the culture and make every every everyone have a good work-life balance and you know everyone's happy and as happy as you can be coming to work but it's i just don't i'm flat outside of work okay can you tell me a little bit about your work um and yeah what you want to know so i'm i'm uh but actually before before we continue i just want to make sure about a couple things so since we're going to be talking about work i just want to make sure that what you share today is not going to like get you in trouble at work no it won't i won't say any okay i'm not hearing anything bad about your job by the way no no and if you know no it's it's not my job it's me you know it's not it's not it's not work instructing me to overwork it's yeah it's quite opposite you know i get told by people to just relax and do less you know what does that feel like well it's easier than done isn't it sure what what causes people to say that to you um i don't know what what happens before they say it yes exactly um i'll be discussing a problem in a lot of depth so i'll want it i'll be wanting to solve something as it arises when it's not necessarily urgent and important it might just be important sure i see so you're working hard and i'm getting the sense that sometimes maybe there are people around you who in your shoes would not work as hard or wouldn't be solving non-urgent issues that are important so like you don't have yeah okay and yeah so can you tell me just like what what you do um yeah so i'm kind of relatively senior manager of a large territory of depots okay uh transport hubs okay so i have a i have a region that i manage with uh managers within there and then teams of drivers and how did you can you tell me a little bit about how long you've been in this field um yeah 10 years 10 years in the in the field and what was the first thing you did in the field can you like walk me through a little bit about your career trajectory yeah sure so uh i used okay i used to i used to work from home doing something different making not very much money but you know it was actually editing you know manuscripts and things like that and that's what i love and i think i still have it well it's what i loved to do i guess i'm not sure i love it now i don't think that was a slip of my subconscious yeah you can't you can't say that you love something yeah andy that's not allowed no no i just i i'm not sure if i i don't think i do now i don't think it's i don't think it's important to success to be grammatically correct but anyway i started as a uh you know an admin assistant a bit of a [ __ ] you know just do whatever anybody wants um and very quickly began managing the site quite luckily my dad got me that job that was pretty lucky so i kind of happened upon it and then worked hard to get the you know be the manager it just kind of happened actually sure i didn't try and didn't work towards it it just kind of fell in my lap actually and and so you were an admin assistant then you start sort of it sounds like you applied yourself there no not really actually it just happened to be good at it at the time so at the time i'm maybe i'd look over to them at the time i was 21 i didn't really care that much you know kind of go and live life and have you know girlfriends and whatever go out drinking with your friends and things so i probably wasn't a very good employee but i did get lucky and get the job here okay once i got the job uh you know turned up for the pedal down i guess help me understand that what changed when you became a manager i think i've just said that and that's not true i think i'm kind of as though i'm in an interview so i'm talking about my career and i'm trying i'm automatically probably giving you a different version there um so i i didn't i didn't apply myself actually so i was still i recognized the opportunity and i did work harder but i also still [Music] was only 21 so i didn't have the skills to do the job but they gave me the job anyway and i did my best really okay so that's interesting so it sounds like you're very good at noticing what you convey to other people and even though you may say something initially from like a narrative perspective you're actually able to like go back and say and kind of like self-edit and really share something that's more correct well yeah i mean i don't know why i just did that it was kind of a reflex of well i mean my girlfriend says to me sometimes i'll just use her name it's michelle um that i'm managing her so we'll be having an argument or just a disagreement so you're managing me and she's probably right my language is still you know i don't have a usually or very rarely have a when i'm at work i speak a little bit differently than this right i kind of speak a bit slower and a bit higher pitched and not intentionally but you just do because i have a northeast accent a lot of people don't understand it uh and yes sometimes i speak to michelle like that i guess how do you how does she know you're is it like the tone and pitch of your voice or the language you use or what probably both yeah okay okay and then can you stop once she points it out to you well at the time i say i'm not you know i don't realize that i am sorry but i probably am here so where where you've been promoted to manager at 21 you're doing better in terms of applying yourself but you really haven't become the person that you are today no no what happened next that i started to receive promotions i guess i i don't know when did i kind of when did this happen i don't know he said you started to receive promotions that sounds to me like don't floating downstream like oh like i walked into work today someone was like here andy have a promotion and then like a week later you're like oh here andy have another promotion if only yeah no so uh yeah sorry am i audible by the way because i'm kind of slipping into this draw tone so i'm i think i've covered by the way which is sounding a bit rough okay um so yeah well i earned them i guess i was the best person at the time do you feel proud of that um i feel an element of pride that i am in the position i am now at my age it's quite unusual i think what's unusual about your position at your age um [Music] no none of my peers all my peers are you know 20 years older than me at least i hope none of them watch this maybe might not be 20 years but it looks to be 20 years okay so so it sounds like you're quite senior can you give us a sense of and i'm trying to figure out if you're me understand what how how big of a manager are you i've put on 30 pounds in the last two years so quite big okay um no like how many people do you manage um so the team has maybe 200 250 maybe more fluctuates but about that okay so i asked you a question how many people you manage and what was the sub since you're an editor what was the subject of the word of the sentence that you responded with well my direct reports is are you asking me how many direct reports i have or how many people i manage because i would my sphere of influence or duty of care is all of them right yep how does it feel to say that um well a bit bit cliche what's it's a bit corporate isn't it you know oh i i feel a sense of care for all my people but it's true i do you know yeah so it's weird because i so i ask you how many people you manage this is what i was zeroing in on you didn't say i manage 250 people or i'm responsible for 250 people you said that team is yeah okay do you see the difference between those two things well yeah they're not my direct report so i don't manage them all thankfully you know so so i think that there's that element to it but i'm noticing that like you remove the first person from a lot of what you say especially if it has to do with like like you're like annoyingly humble okay and i don't mean like i'm personally annoyed by it but i mean like it's like it's excessively humble right what do you think about that annoyingly was a bad word no no it's i'm not you know i don't that doesn't sting me at all um what do i think about that i don't know it kind of is what it is i am where i am okay good so so and i think this is where you know you you make com so like there are other people i'm guessing you're somewhere around 30 we don't have to get into your exact age um 31 very very important you know okay so i think there are a lot of 31 year olds who if they were responsible for managing let's say 250 to 300 people would be egotistical about it right so you're you kind of point out and i think you sort of own these as facts you're just like my peers are 20 years older than i am so like okay the reason i'm zeroing in on this is because like if we think about your problems you don't know who you are so we're dealing with issues of identity and personhood yeah and so some people get egotistical if they're 30 year old hot shots but your pendulum is swung the other way right which is i still think it's like off balance because i'm noticing that it's almost like i really have to like dig to get you to own something good that you've done like you're very like there's there's a third person this or a passivity that i'm noticing is like a theme does that make sense like i you know i kept getting like people kept giving me promotions it's like no i mean you probably aren't like assuming you see what i'm saying so so i i can see that so piece of that is that okay i don't want to come across as arrogant and i'm not genuinely arrogant fine but i'm wondering where since you don't know who you are it's almost like you're removing yourself from the from your statements um i think a part of me is thinking and the chances are really slim you know let's say someone who knows me is watching and then says you [ __ ] that head you know i guess i'm just realized that that's in the back of my head yep right so that's good to realize that yeah but but i don't but i don't i think that i don't care about that though i wouldn't care if someone thought that yet it's in my head so yep it's absolutely shaping your language i i think that anyway right so so like and and that's sort of how this works but you want to say something well objectively you know i'm doing really well i know that you know i don't have much more to add that do you feel pride there i feel lucky i feel fortunate there's that passivity again you see that there isn't any you in the equation well you've got to be good but you've got to be lucky so there's a lot of elements of luck in my career i've had i've been looking to have good good bosses sure i've been i've been lucky to have you know be ready at the right moment for something that was you know really unusual to have occurred in the business sure so so i agree with you that you've got to be lucky and you've got to be good which one do you keep talking about yeah being lucky right so like i'm i'm not saying it's right or wrong i'm just pointing it out to you so so and once again because we're sort of saying like i don't know who i am and like we're not hearing anything about you i mean the way that you talk about this you know you'll you'll sort of like you know i didn't work very hard my dad got me like so you share that detail you share like the one detail from the last 10 years that you don't get to take any credit for interesting yeah and i imagine over the last nine or ten years like you've done something right and if i push you on it you'll admit it because you kind of know that that's right but there's something going on in your mind that removes you from the equation um okay so i guess i feel it's all it could all just go you know i could [ __ ] up or something could happen and it all just falls down i'm not so while i'm saying i i don't have an identity um and my identity is my work i also feel like that can go at any moment so [Music] yeah that it's not it's not so it would be it would be so i don't feel like i i don't feel like there's anything to brag about because it can just go you know yeah just yeah yeah yeah so good let's dig into that for a second okay and i gotta ask you about your upbringing at some point don't let me forget so let's think about what your mind is doing by no so what i'm hearing you kind of say is okay i i'm pointing out to you andy you're not letting yourself have an identity or any kind of pride about work right i'm sort of saying you're removing yourself from that equation is that clear it may not be right let's know okay if it could all go up in smoke how does that tie into your mind being unable or trying to resist giving you a work-based identity [Music] can you repeat that yeah it's i'm this is a sort of a i'm pushing you here i can just explain it again so you so i asked you why don't you let yourself have an identity about work right why don't you own your why don't you feel pride you sort of admit i can grudgingly push you into admitting that you're proud but generally speaking i keep getting lucky my dad got me the job i just kind of showed up i don't know i'm the youngest like a manager of 250 people at the age of 31 and when i was 50 like i don't know i got lucky right so there's no there's no i ownership pride okay so then when i ask you about that you say well it could all go up in smoke so how are those two things related what is your mind doing by not letting you be proud of your work if i if i draw a painting paint a painting it's there you know i've done it it's just uh a more it's tangible and it's and it exists it might get you know burned down or whatever but it exists and you did that you know a painting it could i'm trying to think how you destroy a painting but yeah and try to spend down on it but you did that and it's just it's this thing it's a snapshot it's done the career is ever moving isn't it so sure there's not a there's not a there's nothing it obtained i'm struggling with my life it feels like there's no there's not i'm struggling no you're doing great so i i think you've conveyed it so what i'm getting is that with a painting it's tangible right you can say i built this so there's something concrete that your pride can rest on there's a foundation yeah but a career is fluid and if you were to base your identity or take pride in your work what does that open up open you up to that a painting you know because a painting is safe in that way does that make sense yeah well you you've you get wrecked on you absolutely so i think that's important because i i wonder if what you're doing is like you're not letting yourself have an identity that could be taken away from you well i don't want my identity to be work though okay so that's fine too we'll get to that in a second but yeah are you okay with a part of it being work well yeah it's you know the majority of my time so we'll be going it will be possible no i mean you're actively fighting against that right so that's that's because you don't own what you do at work i mean you do like practically but like you know i i think what's going on here is that that i think you're afraid of letting a piece of your work uh your identity be your work for two reasons one is because you don't want it to you're afraid maybe that all of your identity will be work based then and you don't want to be one of those people and you're trying really hard to not be one of those people which is good in a sense but i think the other part of it is that i'm sort of getting a sense that you don't want your identity to be based on something that isn't a strong foundation because if if work blows up in your face then your identity goes with it yeah okay what do you think about that um yeah okay yeah if i if i kind of built my ego around it that would that would be unfortunate wouldn't it yes that would be and i don't think you're willing to risk that what do you think i don't know what attaching my ego to work looks like to i can't even i can't even comprehend it really to understand to answer okay so i can't i don't i can't uh i can't understand what avoiding that is looking like other than through the conversation yeah yeah okay that makes sense so that that's that's a completely acceptable answer so i'm going to just sort of ask you one kind of like question one more time do you let yourself feel pride yeah i'm really competitive you know and with shallow things you know if i make a better sandwich you know anything you know you know hell yeah i tied those shoes you know okay how do you feel when you do that uh yeah good usually it's jovial isn't it well always yeah yeah so you're competitive so there's usually there so that means that like you take pride in things when you out perform other people oh definitely yeah especially at work yeah or secretly you know okay so i'm writing and no one else knows huh i'm i'm kind of racing and no one else knows what does that feel like to be no but silly i guess yeah what's silly about it um well it's not a real victory is it if no one else is racing you but i like to be try to be you know the best at whatever it is whatever it is you know anything and the other thing and i've had to let go of that a little bit just for time uh i'm spending too much time at work so i have to think sometimes think [ __ ] it just send it out or you know relatively inconsequential things why do you think you compete with other people who don't know that they're competing well everyone's competing really everybody it's a you know everyone has a ranking of competency don't they sure and so it's just chipping away that not chipping away then but kind of chipping my way up yeah so i uh andy this is going to be hard but i hear two parallel conversations so there's like the reality of things which your mind says logically and then sometimes when we're talking to you you dig a little bit deeper and there's like more emotion you'll start to grin right and then yeah i'm trying i'm trying you know i'm trying but yeah i think you're doing great i don't mean to imply that what i'm saying is that i i think this is exactly what's going on is that you've got this surface level conversation and then sometimes if we ask the right question like we'll get some life well like you know you know and so then you'll kind of grin and you'll sort of say like it's not really fair if if you're running you're the only one who knows you're running a race right and there's almost this like mischievous little yeah but but i i get i get life from you there and then if i ask you about it you'll go to like i'm trying to i'm trying to think really hard to answer the question and i don't want i i have i have a bad habit of joking too much personally but personal life okay not um you know never serious blah blah blah has been the motif in my personal life probably so can you just take something seriously whereas at work it's actually the opposite you know what's the opposite at work uh not as well more serious more stoic pragmatic so you joke too much in your real life and you try to reign that in yeah i don't try it just happens now i guess i don't think i won't say that actually sometimes i do think that yeah oh i won't say that that'd be really funny but i'm not gonna say that sometimes it's really immature like that's what she said but you just can't say those things and in the type of meetings i'm in i would love to but yeah yeah okay think for a second yes okay can you tell me a little bit about um what what yeah what growing up was like for you yeah really good great childhood tell me about that um uneventfully stereotypical you know going out with friends and doing whatever until they got dark you know i sound like a boomer a little bit maybe i'm not a boomer i'm 31 but you know just going out and doing stuff before that you know i'd had you sound like a boomer because you use the word out yeah yeah yeah i'm envisioning that you were outside with other humans yeah yeah yeah yeah which makes you a boomer because that's what the boomers did yeah so uh you know going out and playing and coming back and getting dirty and having my own room and had a pc and my dad did everything he could to you know buy things for us okay so what was your family situation like at home uh yeah mum and dad in love you know for the most part yeah and any siblings uh yeah uh abrasion um and are your and it sounds like your dad worked and your mom was at home uh for the most part yeah in in memory yeah i think she worked a little bit when i was really young but yeah yeah so my dad worked all the time and i'm modeling myself with my dad and i'm working loads you know how are you i don't know i think so yeah so well so i like i said i try i don't self-reflect but i tried to ahead of the call you know to sit down and think about stuff you don't i self-reflect well i do i do in my career i do notice you know what skill do i need for whatever's next but i don't really sell like that at home until until i've realized well i'm not [ __ ] happy here what the hell is going on i need to do something about it which and then i was just happened to be on youtube saw one of your videos again so i'll just i'll ask the man you know sure so so yeah so then i did some self-reflection and i kind of thought about you know my dad and well actually first first of all i moved from what makes me happy to what makes me sad because i couldn't think of a lot of things that made me happy and the main thing i could the main thing i came up with is films i don't know if it's superficial to cry at a film and that's not like real emotion or something if it's tapping a vein of something but i kind of wrote down the films that made me cry and they're all films so one is fences have you seen fences no it's it's a film with denzel washington in which is not relevant uh and he's a uh it's the 19 something 20s or 30s or something like that and you know he's a obviously a black man he's a parent of a son and i i do forget the what time it was but essentially the dad is living in one world which is the world where things are not fair and you know he'll he will only advance so far because of systemic racism and the sun is you know there's still it must not it can't be 1920s but he's kind of getting a potentially a football scholarship and he's living in a slightly different world with slightly more opportunities still [ __ ] you know still not right but and then so they're different in that way and there's a scene there's a scene in that film where he says to his dad you know why don't you like me right because the dad's just on him all the time could be disciplined and stuff and there's no parallel left my dad by the way but he says i don't have to like you i [ __ ] i work all day i put clothes on your back i feed you you know who says i gotta like you who what lawyers say that sort of gonna like you it's always kind of it's just duty and anyway he's not happy he cheats on his wife it's all [ __ ] everyone hates him he but all he's done is he's it's just worked and worked and worked and he dies obviously because everyone does in the film and it's just so tragic that he's just worked and worked for the sense of duty worked and worked and then he's just [ __ ] dead not only is he dead but the people he worked for as in his family kind of hate him or hated him at one point you know i've not seen the film for a while but that i was bawling my eyes out like never before that film and thought immediately that my dad just works all the time and worked for the family and um it was there was a so there's a parallel with the work ethic but not with but he wasn't he didn't treat me in that way so you never felt like your dad didn't like you no never yeah and uh no love to me unconditionally no matter what yeah absolutely and then you know it was just other films and they were all about father-son relationships i i guess a bit weird what's weird well it's just weird isn't it that's really specific thing to just tap it to have a toothache about you know right okay if you say so i i don't think so so well it's you it's not so it seems like those kinds of as they strike a chord with you yeah they strike a chord with me yeah they hit a they hit a nerve you know that's why i'm saying toothache you know they just yeah yeah and but why do you think that's weird because i don't know why okay but it won't be that it'll be some people will but it'll be something else maybe the reason it's weird is because it actually does not mirror your experience because you do have a dad who loves you and supports you and stuff like that yeah but the bit that's tragic is just working and working and working and working and then he'll die one day right so i speak to my dad now right and he works he's changed careers and he he works monday to sunday every week 10 11 12 15 16 17 hours he just keeps working he can't sit down and watch a film unless it's spartacus he might watch that but other than that he just works all the time and i i say to him don't you want to stop and you'll say oh i'll just make money for your mum and then when i'm dead she'll have enough money to be okay that's all he says kind of half joke but he's still doing the hours so it must be true and what did you think about that well it's freaking tragic isn't it i wish my dad would come on this show but he never ever would because that would be great stop him from working all the time but then i'm doing the same i guess which is i guess yeah i was gonna say i i don't know if if i don't know if what resonates with you is your relationship with your dad i think what you what could be resonating with you is your relationship with your son well he's he's in a sock on the floor i don't have one yeah not yet but what do you think you're afraid of what would it like if you had a son what would it be like what would your relationship with him like that'd be a pretty good dad i think would you be working 12 14 15 16 hours a day no i don't i don't that i don't do that i don't work that much my dad never used to work that much that's a new thing it's going to last few years he used to work a lot he used to work away you know truck driving so kind of be out at night and things but he was a he was around he was around you know sometimes what was it like having a dad who was around sometimes um unimpactful i don't know i think you know there's different parts of your childhood that you remember more right so yeah i do have resolve you know uh oh we would we were doing this on this day we were going to the shop we're going to buy some pokemon cards or something but then he's busy so he's not going i've got a few memories like that but for the most part he's around and we did stuff yeah different times of the month i'm hearing that he was a good dad it was great yeah but there's a kind of sacrifici sacrificial element to it don't you think in being a parent sure i'm not one what do you think he sacrificed well well it's like the guy from fences it's your your duty is to just crack on and keep working even if the job [ __ ] you just got to work haven't you because your kid wants new nike train sneakers sure so what did he sacrifice uh i don't know whatever his passion was wasn't truck driving right yeah so and that's kind of tragic isn't it uh that is a tragedy but that's a that's kind of a shared tragedy isn't it that's the human experience i think for the most part so it's a bit muted well it sounds like it's your dad's experience and possibly yours um yeah maybe but i'm not working through a sense of duty i'm working through a sense of anxiety really if i stop that often start getting worried what happens when you try to take a break what mounts up does that really okay uh or does it feel like like when people say you can relax or that you can work less and you said you get anxious and then you talked a little bit about feeling like you don't deserve things um well it just comes back to the kind of fluid fluidity of your career and it can end at any moment well not know if i can help it you know can't think for a second yeah please this is tricky andy because i think i have a sense of what could be going on i just don't know do you think that films can be formative for you if i think about something like the lion king which is up i know this is really silly always been my favorite film of all time knows will be and that's the same isn't it so that's you know i'm sure have you seen the lion king yeah yeah so you know that's again the same thing isn't it sense of duty you die for your son that thing yeah does that form i don't know i i don't i don't know why that ended up on my notes when i was kind of brainstorming but okay it was just this connection between fences which made me bawl my eyes out and the lion king it's kind of roughly the same just a dad who sacrifices everything so what i'm hearing from you is that in your life there is not an experience that clearly ties into what deeply resonates with you about film yeah that's why it's weird yeah that you feel the most alive watching these movies yeah probably okay yeah what's alive i don't know probably yeah that stings a little bit but probably right here yeah okay is there something i should have asked you about um that's a good question isn't it but no okay so like there isn't like something that some experience like how does your dad feel about the work that you do i'm really proud yeah that my mum and dad are really proud of me you know what's it like yeah yeah yeah they they love me you know my mum finds me i'm the funniest person in the world i'm not so much to michelle you know you know she doesn't really think my lanking impressions are very good but my mum does you know okay all right um i don't think i have any skeletons in the closet or you know yeah yeah that i'm getting that sense so how do you think it would feel to be mufasa or denzel washington uh pretty tragic well no mufasa is not tragic that's a little bit different isn't it but then i'll watch it uh yeah the dad didn't fences yeah it'd be pretty brutal wouldn't it you just waste your life and then you're dead i mean that's what we're that's what you're doing that's what i'm saying that's why that's why i'm saying that resonated with me is because oh well i don't think i was saying that but i realized i've said that's what i said yeah yeah i mean that's what we're talking about so i don't think it's weird at all but it's not a sense of duty i don't have a sense of duty to anyone i don't have a kid i'm not working so when my kid's born i'm making six figures are you gonna i mean you don't have to answer this but have you thought about having children um only only when self-reflecting no only because i noticed that the films that made me cry you there's a relationship there's a there's a father son or a mother or a father daughter relationship or a mother-daughter relationship and some of them and all my favorite films actually kind of have that relationship in them like interstellar is all about father's love for his daughter isn't it yeah that scene where he's like yelling at himself not to leave and all that good stuff yeah powerful stuff yeah yeah yeah things like that yeah yeah andy what's your help me understand are you like religious or spiritual what do you no is it the fleece what is it the fleece thank you see that that made you ask that no glasses okay what is the fleece in the glass is that a joke i don't get the joke no it's not no no no someone asked me if i was a vegan uh when i had this fleece on with these glasses and i suppose they are a bit hipster but i don't mean to install religious people that they're hipsters by the way i'm not religious at all not in the slightest okay um and what do you think happens after you die yeah don't you nothing happens how confident are you in that yeah 100 well you know technically everyone's agnostic who's an atheist aren't they but you know 99.9 okay you know it wasn't the case you know i wish i could take a pill and believe in the afterlife that would be great wouldn't it i i don't know i've never thought about that so let me so here's here's the thing i'm not sure that asking you more questions so sometimes i interview someone and like it's pretty easy to tell what's going on and we kind of crack the nut pretty simply i think i have a good sense of what's going on i don't know that i'm going to be able to ask you a series of questions that will get you there okay i think i can explain it to you but i don't know that socratic questioning i can't see a way to get you to where i think you are i can explain it to you yeah please tell me i'm just gonna so it's just it's different because sometimes like we get there through like realization and questioning but like so what i'm gonna offer you is something of like a hypothesis and the hypothesis is going to have some stuff that i think is like pretty reliable and some stuff that is completely unreliable and out of this world okay so the first thing is that i think you actually systemically move away from yourself like you know you feel hollow and dead inside and we actually see that like if you go back and you just watch your face like don't even listen to the words yeah like watch this video on mute and even now like i'm scratching something right so when i like you're hollow and dead inside you're like yeah that's me right and maybe there's a joke something like no no no no no no the joke is a good thing it's no that's just no no that's just you know that's what people say you know sometimes i just look miserable i'm not miserable well i well i am because i'm on the show but i don't feel miserable at the time when people say what's wrong with you so so let's talk about so this is the two layers that i'm talking about so let's talk about misery for a second so i think part of the reason like the other theme i'm kind of getting is like there's two layers of you one is like the logical and you say well i'm not miserable but i am miserable it's like all these statements that you make that run contrary to there's like there's like the logic you you well i have a lot to be grateful for and i'm you know i worked hard sure like because i work hard and people say i should work less but i don't deserve what like there's like just this two it's just two things and one of them is like literally like deadpan like your your tone is low your voice is low maybe it's the kovid maybe it's the accent but if we ask around like here's the thing here's the dynamic i've noticed i'll see some life and then i'll ask a follow-up question and then it'll get quashed yeah okay right so like are you miserable i don't feel miserable right now but there's uh there is something that needs working on yeah right so even like if you pay attention to your face first half of the answer very little second half of the answer more right yeah so so misery exists on two levels so there's like this is the the big problem with i think modern psychology well no i mean modern psychology is catching up but if you look at buddha buddha right so he sort of he used this word sanskrit word means suffering and we in the west tend to think more about emotions and pain but we don't it's my experience that suffering and contentment is exists at a different layer from like emotions and pain and the best way to understand this is watching a tragic movie because emotionally it's tragic you're sad you're crying but it feels good right it's kind of weird so what i'm sort of noticing is that on the surface level you have no complaints things are good you're not like miserable your health is pretty good you have a good relationship your parents love you right so what the [ __ ] do you have to complain about but like underneath there's like emptiness and then so there's this dichotomy first of all okay second thing is that you actively move away from this bottom layer okay so i'll just toss out different things like i just don't like you're a joker right in your heart of hearts in here you're a joker yeah yeah but when you have a joke what do you do with it yeah well it depends where i am but yeah i'm trying i'm trying to concentrate i'm trying to use my logical part of my brain to talk and absorb and i don't want to kind of it's like oh that's a funny joke don't go away you know oh that's a funny joke exactly right so so when you try when you push away your jokes right and there's like a good reason for that right so like you don't get into like sexual harassment cases in in in the workplace i mean i mean right i mean right now you know i'm trying to focus on i want you i want to be no so i want you to make jokes any joke that comes into your mind for the rest of the interview i will put air filter on for your stream's sake but yeah thank you tos yeah yeah but like if you have a joke i want you to just toss it out okay and i want you to just see how that feels right like yeah okay right yeah i'm hearing you okay so so that's just one example but i think there's like all kinds of other like i don't know how to like so i keep on asking you if you're proud i'm trying to get you to say i'm proud or i'm not proud but you just like waffle around right like like so because i think that you do feel i'm like do you feel any pride and you're like yeah of course i feel pride but like do you let yourself feel pride that the answer that is no are you proud sure do you have a lot to be grateful for there's some element of humility in there i think some of that's legit i mean i think that's very genuine but i think it's it's almost like you don't let yourself own who you are and there's a lot of like any time we get down there to the bottom layer you kind of like devalue it so like i love these movings but that's weird isn't it yeah right it's silly it's weird you know and let's not i'm i'm not going to touch as a 10-foot pole this is not beyond my pay grade but this whole business about your mom thinks you're the funniest person on the planet and your wife wants you to stop i mean not wife long-term girlfriend wants you to stop making jokes like there's a whole we can dive into that if you want to but i think that's like a good example of like and see there's something real but if i ask you about your girlfriend and michelle you're gonna do it no no go out do my best what's it like when she doesn't want you to make jokes uh it feels like she's rejecting a part of me how does it feel to have it's not i don't know if that's actually what's happening because you know what'd you just do well yeah but if i'm if i'm singing the same alexander hamilton song two years later no no no no no no no no not that you said it feels like she's rejecting a part of me and then what was the next [ __ ] sentence out of your mouth yeah yeah yeah okay not okay say it i said i don't know what you i minimized it i said something there it is right so one is like and let's just think about this when you say it feels like she's rejecting a part of me like that's an authentic feeling yeah you get that like that's real it may not be true but then like this other layer like protective andy comes up yeah yeah right okay that's interesting actually so it might not be true but you're feeling it yeah right and so so this is what's happening is like you don't know who you are that's because tell me logically who are you what is identity yeah it's what you love to do but that's that's who you are right so like you can't have an identity logically like you can never discover yourself through logic who you are is experiential on its fundamental level and you started the interview with you know what do you do when your work becomes your identity like that's a logical exchange right so i can bucket you based on your profession but that's not really who you are like that's the whole point of this discussion so when you're operating from this upper level of like this is not who i am i'm more than my work whatever like you can try to you can talk about it until you're blue in the face but you're never going to discover yourself that way and what i'm noticing is like time and again you push away like this element of yourself and i think that's how you've lost yourself okay yeah right because you like i know who you are like i know it's weird to say that but like i i think we see who you truly are when you're joking right you're i mean you're more than that but that's just that's the one thing that can still crack through the surface for moments yeah right and like do you feel alive when you're cracking a joke yeah of course yeah of course right yeah you have a minimizing statement to make about that too but doesn't everybody it's just a joke that's not life yeah no something you said there just uh made sense you know so literally the kind of the thought that minimized the part about you know uh michelle not accepting a part of me because well that's not really true it's exactly why i started and that's what you said is you know so it's not really important i don't need to correct myself do i there's an answer probabilities and if it's true or not so yeah but i mean that's like who you are is not like an objective thing who you are is a purely subjective thing it is as subjective as you can possibly get yeah and and so like i i you know there's just there's just so many things so when we talk about pride when we talk about joking when we talk about some of this work related stuff the passivity right so like like when you try to come up and you say like hey i'm you know i i far outpace my peers like that's a statement of fact but like you won't even say that right like it it's like pulling teeth and when you say that your face is as like gray shade as you can possibly get i'm 31 years old and i all of my colleagues are 20 years older than me and i manage 250 people yeah okay right um yeah and how do you feel right now uh um yeah that was pretty spot on yeah so yeah i don't know why i don't know why i've changed to be like that yeah don't worry about the why close your eyes for a second just feel what you feel i'm gonna just talk at you in my andy impression okay yeah and i want you to just bask in the sensation my name is andy i'm 31 years old i manage i'm a senior manager this is doing things to me like what sexually that's a joke right oh my god i'm not saying [Laughter] right so like who are you right now uh i don't know yeah right but can you feel you right now yeah i'm not saying touch yourself i'm saying can you feel you it's too late for that yeah right yeah so like i don't know how else to say this andy this is this is who you are so like you can open your eyes so like i this is this is why i was kind of asking about spirituality so there are a couple things i'm going to share with you the first is that who you are is not an identity that is built up over time it is an experience of the present so like when you crack a joke i think you are like in your purest state of self now you don't want to be cracking that all the time this is why so for example like there's a very there are lots of famous stories about zen masters achieving enlightenment and the first thing that they do is laugh there is even a sanskrit word that the word for reality is actually like play so like the like what we you the the word that sanskrit in sanskrit gets translated into english is reality so if i were to ask you what's the sanskrit word for reality one word is one translation is lila but technically lila means play and that the whole universe is like it's like a not a play isn't a false representation but it is the act of play and so there's just this very visceral kind of part of you that i think that cognitively maybe like at some point there's also work-related stuff here right because when you're 26 years old and you're far above where you should be on the corporate ladder you can't you have to be like extra serious because you have to play the part yeah so so just sorry i don't want to interrupt you if you're delivering in there yeah okay so please interrupt yeah okay um yeah so two things happened really you know um [Music] one you know promoted quickly into positions of authority where you need to appear and be credible you know so you can't you've got to kind of cut that that [ __ ] out yeah because you're already younger and then two i mean something that impacted me in the past was kind of the whole you know losing your hair moment of oh [ __ ] hell my hair's falling out you know i'm 21 my hair's falling out it's in the sink you know while you're brushing your teeth and [ __ ] you know [ __ ] what the hell do you do about it uh the answer is by the way if i can just shave your head don't do what i did which is wait three years too late and then shave your head it's told the wrong thing to do but that kind of matured me quickly because you know the position and then kind of being bald kind of aged me a bit it's like well how how immature can you be now so that has definitely impacted how i interact with strangers absolutely right so so i i i don't know if you asked this question but i have this kind of question why are you this way why do you have these two layers why do you on some level i think it's numbness you like inflict numbness on yourself in some ways it's suppression yeah but why and i think it's because exactly like so you didn't just learn you know you this isn't random it you know it's hap like you've developed this cognitive structure for a reason and there are influences evolutionary influences on your cognition over time and i think essentially like you know you almost got developmentally like skipped a couple of steps professionally and so then you sort of had to like almost fake it till you make it or you had to adopt a persona of overly serious yeah definitely 100 yeah right on the nail so so but the thing is this is the key thing about the mind is that the mind can't do that naturally selectively so for example when we look at something called the lexithymia which is the inability to like exp understand what you're feeling emotionally so it's like emotional colorblindness okay the interesting thing is that when we numb ourselves so sometimes we'll use certain techniques either substances or cognitive techniques or video games or whatever to numb our internal emotional state the interesting thing is then people will say like oh i don't feel happy i don't feel happy i don't feel happy and the thing is our mind can't numb just the sadness it has to numb everything so it's like turning the volume down like if you turn the volume down like everything is going to go down and so i think what you've managed to do is by some combination of you know a girlfriend and professional things and all kinds of other stuff also some amount of confusion and not allowing yourself i mean i think that you do so because it sounds like you let yourself indulge in worst cases what will happen is you'll have men like yourself who start crying during movies and they're like i don't understand what's going on so i'm going to never watch those movies again and thankfully you didn't do that or maybe you went through your own internal no i love it it's like uh yeah it's just great it's just a release isn't it when you do you can't plan it you can't think i'll have a cry today i'll put a sad film on but when you do it feels good yeah so so thankfully you let yourself kind of engage in that but i do think that there's a reason why your mind does this okay so that's sort of like the logical side that's the psychological side that's what i feel pretty confident about there's also like tips right so the first thing is that just first of all recognize your devaluing statements and notice that you're the only thing you're going to devalue or the thing that you consistently devalue is like your experience of something right so it's not like i it's not that i worked hard it's that i got lucky well like everyone like you have to get lucky to get promoted yeah but you know you're not you're not like slipping and sliding into yeah okay into where you right so there's a personal element that you kind of quash okay yeah definitely yeah so that's a piece of it so if you want to be happy in life you have to stop quashing that right if you want to know who you are like that's who you are you aren't like a father or a worker or someone like that you're a bald dude who makes funny jokes and is also a hard worker is also loving has made his parents proud you can probably have a cry about that if you let yourself at some point what do you think about that um yeah those are all things that i do or am to others but when i was saying i don't feel like i have a self i think when i was well it's spot on but but also it's linked to kind of don't i don't enjoy anything everything is kind of volumes turned down and everything right you know but i guess you're saying that's linked to yeah so i think that's a piece of it but there's still there's still a big chunk missing here so we'll get to that in a second but like so the first thing is that i think that this is going to be the kind of thing where i can't i think as you turn the volume up you're going to get more information about who you are and then you have to walk that journey so we're not going to like that's the first thing is like you got to turn the volume up then you'll start to really start to discover who you are it you know it's then the discovery then you start the journey like you know the the turning the volume up is like the first step or not even the first step it's like the prerequisite it's it's the you know the the starter pistol going off before you start the race yeah now the other wild thing is that like so when things resonate with us okay why do they resonate with us because of personal experience right like that's what the nature of resonance is so in psychology what we assume then is because personal experience must have come from the past or from this life then we get confused like you did because these father-son relationships are deeply resonating with you but it doesn't map on to your life so it doesn't make sense that it resonates right uh it makes sense a bit around kind of my dad i think he's kind of i wish he'd worked less i guess kind of sacrificed yeah do you do you think how do you feel about your wanting your dad let me think about what what kind of question is not going to scare you away what do you think about your dad not being perfect uh yeah i'm used to it yeah he's just a guy like everyone else he [ __ ] up like others in life you know yeah see you're a slippery one there okay i'm trying just telling you i don't know i i know i i'm not blaming you that was a mean thing for me to say so it was very important i think that this is i apologize i really do i'm fine so there's a couple things here one is that your dad working 12 to 17 hours being absent for long periods of time because you love him because he loves you there's a psychological possibility like if i was a therapist i would dig into this because i believe that what resonates with you about these movies is that it mirrors your own father-son relationship okay i thought you were a therapist i mean i am but if i was doing therapy with you like i would dig into that is this not therapy no this is not therapy which i'm pretty sure you understand and you're joking about yeah so it's but but what i what i mean by that is is like you know we can assume that what resonates with you in movies mirrors your own relationship i i think that you could have something going on which i oftentimes see for men who love their fathers which is that we don't want to ever admit that they did something that was hurtful or tragic or neglectful towards us especially if they made sacrifices and had good reasons to do it right so like you you want to give your dad a pass for not showing up and buying pokemon cards with you because he had a really good reason and you don't want to blame him for that the tricky thing is that the emotional hurt for eight-year-old you still existed now the really tricky thing here is that if you don't if you give if you make excuses for him you can't ever forgive him what's to forgive what's to forgive so you know i'm going to start defending my dad here i don't mean i'm not trying to yeah do that i'm just trying so you know he's a guy with whatever talent in life and he's got to put bread on the table so you just do whatever you need to do to do that and sometimes that means you've got freaking work on a weekend tough kid kind of thing you know that hurts as a kid because you don't really understand but it's like it's like the scene in uh it's like the scene in um fences you know he says i have to be there on the weekend you know do i put food on the table and you know give you an xbox and a cool coke fridge to play halo 1 on yeah he did you know so i don't know if there's anything to forgive he was also present out of the times yeah if i remember it does that mean it was persistent i don't know so so this is the weird thing right so like you're drawing more parallel defenses with your own experience okay right like like we're talking about your relationship with your dad and you're bringing up fences again yeah so like i think this is hard because i don't know if if cognitively or like emotionally you're ready to accept that your life may have been a little bit closer defenses than you give it credit for but and i think the reason you may not be willing to accept that is because your dad is not denzel washington from fences right he's better than that so that's where there's like confusion and conflict because he wasn't there he had a good reason but this is when you ask what is forgiveness forgiveness is like admitting a wrong and then saying it's okay excuses like saying oh it's not actually a problem do you understand i understand so i don't know if you need to walk that journey with your dad or not like you know i don't know it's a possibility so if you're trying to understand remember let's go like one level higher we're understanding why on earth do you resonate with all these father-son themes no-brainer from a therapy perspective it's because of your own frigging relationship right thank god i thought you're gonna say i want to have sex with him no um so other thing is that you know that you may be able to map that on to your other relationships as well maybe your relationship with your mom but here's the other thing that i want to share with you because i think this could be where the money is so sometimes uh i think that what could be happening one is that this is actually a predictive thing where where this is like so has you're not gonna figure this out or you won't feel complete until you have a child now i know that that goes against so much like pc thinking like oh like you don't need to be fulfilled like children aren't necessarily fulfillment i completely agree i'm not saying that you should have children or you shouldn't have children all i'm saying is that if there's a motif that is like resonating with you deeply it may not be your father-son relationship with your dad it could be your father-son relationship with your kid and that's kind of confusing but sometimes when it comes to like meaning in life and feeling fulfilled i think we can safely say that parent parent-child relationships are a source of fulfillment for many human beings is it the only source of fulfillment for human beings absolutely not can you be completely fulfilled and choose not to have children absolutely but we also know that human experience which is why the why we have so many father-son relationship themes in our movies because they tend to be central to the experience of life okay now there's a simple way to put this so the two other now we're gonna go completely off the rails so one is that karmically your atman your soul chose this birth because you have an incomplete karma with another soul who will one day be your son and it is your resonance with this incomplete karma which is like that's why you're born that's why you exist on like a deeply existential level the reason that your ottoman or your soul took birth is to resolve this conflict you have a debt to pay you have a duty to fulfill you have some kind of relationship to have with another soul that i would assume would be your child i'm not saying that that's correct or that's true or you need to believe that part of what i try to do with people is share perspectives and the reason that i hold on to this perspective is i know it sounds completely unscientific but boy is it helpful yeah so sometimes i do believe that like we have duties right so what's resonating with you is that you have an incomplete duty so you will never feel fulfilled because you're not doing your duty and in a sense of personal fulfillment to do your duty to have that conversation with your son to be denzel washington and fences that's like i don't know how to say this but you have like a gravity towards that experience and if we're saying psychologically that all gravities towards experiences come from places which i 100 agree because i don't think that the mind is random and we're saying that it hasn't come from your past i know it sounds kind of weird the only other place it could be coming from is your future because it's got to be coming from somewhere and i know that sounds weird and illogical but there's a system of karma and reincarnation and stuff like that that sort of suggests that this could be what's going on so i'm putting it to you i don't think it's scientific i don't think it's i think it's sort of scientific but i i don't think you need to believe it i'm just if you have a question of why i don't feel fulfilled it's like on the bucket list for why okay the other thing i wanted to say one more thing incomplete karma oh yeah the other thing is that this could be a resonance of an experience from a past life so that is also equally unscientific but i've just had good outcomes in terms of personal fulfillment and understanding when like there may have been some kind of relationship that you were either the dad or you or the son or who knows um you know i don't know if this sounds kind of weird but do you feel guilt when you watch fences oh definitely yeah so like i'm the sucker yeah yeah definitely yeah so that's weird right because what the hell are you feeling guilty for for being the for being the thing that was sacrificed for okay so kind of upsetting yeah right so we're get not where i thought we were going but i think we got somewhere what do you how do you understand that oh how do i understand that how do i understand what okay let me ask a couple other questions so you feel guilty because your dad had to drive a truck for a very long time right to do what for you yeah set me up for the future and he even got me the first job right so there's probably almost a thing about you know he's planted the seed for this career and i need to kind of go somewhere with it and keep going to you know honor the sacrifice or something it sounds a bit cheesy but maybe that's uh there's that devaluing again when you get to something real right so so andy i mean now i'm i think i think now things are clicking for me so then like now we sort of understand right like now i think a lot of things are making sense to me which is first of all like it's hard to feel pride in something that came at the cost of your dad yeah right so maybe we were wrong about like right because like everything that you built comes from [Music] and this isn't you don't blame your dad for not being there for pokemon cards but like you acknowledge that he couldn't be there right and like i think on some level you're okay with him not being there for you but you identify with his the internal disappointment that he has to deal with not being able to be there for you was that too much one sentence you no uh i was i i i thought you were going somewhere else with that yeah tell me i i thought you were just saying i thought you were just saying what i said back to me but then he said uh what did you just say yeah i mean so so when your dad doesn't show up to get you the pokemon cards yeah yeah yeah yeah it's not about you i think you understand what he must be feeling because i don't think you're oblivious yeah yeah yeah yes probably right and that's what hurts the most is that he may be disappointed in himself and he just yeah probably well yeah i think that my dad is would be very critical of himself as a father but it's misplaced but what's it like to watch him do that to himself yes it's it's heartbreaking and and you know my my brother has not honored the sacrifice um we'll say [Laughter] okay i mean he's just not living his best life let's say that you know drugs and things boring honey okay so andy i'm you know you say you don't know who you are and how to be happy and i'm noticing that there's a lot of [ __ ] that you need to turn the volume down on turn the volume down yeah there's a lot of [ __ ] that you need to turn the volume down on okay right so like i think that part of the reason like what's going on here is like there's a lot here so the guilt you know and this started with guilt it started with a feeling of guilt and and you know like watching as you put it heartbreaking right there's anger towards your your brother there's weird kinds of feelings in terms of yeah i mean there's a lot of anger yeah yeah he's still drawing from [Music] my dad now right you know to this day to this morning you know and again you know oh i need to i need to pay this person back or he's going to i can kill me or blow the cars up or set the house on fire what you know all this [ __ ] and my dad always says you know this is it this is the last time no more not doing it again but invariably and inevitably always always hands over the cash because that's him that's what he does you know but you know that's my brother so there you did it again yeah yeah yeah i caught myself with that one yep so i think i mean you are who you are and your happiness andy is at the bottom of this right like you have to work through all of this stuff so i'd actually recommend like i don't know if you've ever seen a therapist before uh no never never this definitely definitely okay so this is one of the cases where i think seeing a therapist is actually like a really good idea for you but it's not because you're ill so generally speaking we think about therapy and even when when we describe therapy on this stream because if you look at the legality of it right so like if we look at licensure laws training it has to do with illness but i i think in terms of like finding your happiness i don't know how else to put this there's just a layer of psychological crap up here that you need to get through because like you need to turn up the volume on your internal self it's not i mean cracking jokes is not going to make you happy it'll be a one step in the right direction but i think anger towards your brother i think anger towards your dad i i don't think i have any anger towards my dad i am aware of that that's why i think you need to see a therapist because i think you have anger towards your dad not okay okay i'll be open-minded on that i'll take your advice but i mean maybe you don't but it's bizarre i think you probably see your dad as a victim and you see that he's getting taken advantage of and he loves his son and all that good stuff right yeah there's usually anger under that well i'm angry that he won't okay what do you mean i'm angry that he won't just there you go let whatever happen happen and then if you want to go even further than that there's even brothers older or younger you're good okay so how ballpark how much younger three years okay the last place that there may be anger towards your dad or your mom is have there been times in your life where your dad was supposed to do something for you and didn't get a chance to because of your brother i have i have no memory of anything i i'm trying to think so that's okay so i'll we don't have to get into it yeah okay so so i'll i'll just give you a simple example so i do a lot of addiction psychiatry work and i see this a lot in the siblings with no idea if it applies to you or not i see this a lot in the siblings of people who have substance use problems ton of resentment so when when you have a child with substance use parents love their children right there's one kid who needs more help needs more love needs more support and inevitably what i see time and time again is the sibling over performs is an absolute boss at work learns how to be independent because the the love and attention and support of the parents is being siphoned towards the child with addiction and oftentimes there's resentment on the child who does a good job and there's a lot of like layers of [ __ ] on top before people realize that because they always resentment to the childhood is a good job no the child who does a good job the child who does a good job is the one who winds up in my office okay just like you like it's actually stunning how many men in their 30s who over perform or at manager levels have this problem it's actually funny now that i think about it i i didn't connect those dots until now but it's a very really common problem so like what what happens then is like they actually resent their parents and it takes but they feel guilty for resenting their parents because if clearly like i have a brother who's a fuck-up and my he needs the support more than i do so like i can't blame my parents for like prioritizing him i think what they're doing is stupid that they can own pretty easily right they need to learn how to set boundaries but it's really hard for them to get to the point that like my life my parents chose my brother who may have had justified reasons why they needed his attention more or but like there still can be resentment like it's really it doesn't feel like that's it yeah so i'm laying this out for you because i i don't know that like i said i think this is more i don't know yeah go ahead yeah i think i think that's i think that despite the attention of my brother needed and all of the energy and emotion and that snaps out of people despite that for the most part they were still there for me and provided me with the opportunities like the like the job and whatever else money if i needed money you know at times i've been between jobs and you know my dad would give me money yeah so so that's that's good to hear so it may not it may not apply to you i'm just sort of mapping it out for you so that like you can kind of think through this either on your own or you know you know there may be it's just very common that when there's a sibling we also see this with siblings who have medical problems so one child has medical problems the other child has is doesn't so parents attention primarily goes to one child and understandably so justifiably so and then a child who is successful oftentimes becomes a doctor themselves you know is very independent then winds up in my office and then we have to work through these some of these issues okay so i think you know the one thing we did kind of find is that you know you feel guilty which is strange strange in a sense but i think we've figured out how it's not strange yeah you know that that your dad had to do all this stuff for you also sort of makes sense why it's like you know it's hard to enjoy food that came at the cost of you know it's hard to enjoy the fruits of ladies and gentlemen yeah right especially when it like is significant sacrifice on his part yeah and i mean if we we can go into it further if you want to but there's even like certain comments right so like your dad says oh i have to work so that i can take care of your mom and you see him he's going to say that but i don't think he says that about you does he say that about you what what about me sorry like taking care of you does he talk no no no no he's we're completely you know i'm completely independent yeah so i know it sounds kind of weird but i think there's something there too where like on some level on some subtext he's not saying it about you now but have you ever talked to your dad about the sacrifices he's made for you no okay yeah okay he's not he's a if i'm a cl if i seem to be a closed book he's worse okay so let me ask you why not well for example dad why are you working so much you know uh so that if i die mum's got some money oh okay then you know okay so i'm gonna ask you a question andy have you [Music] talked to him about how much he's done for you no no i should probably should so let's understand this a little bit better why not we don't yeah we don't talk like that we don't talk yes so i think that yeah don't worry about should so much so i i think you know i want to be careful with that word so the main first reason is because i think you haven't done that because you weren't taught how right like because your dad as you said is a closed book so like conversations amongst men about our feelings are you know reserved for movies that we watch and no actual words exchanged yeah except for when i'm at work when i'm at work i deal with you know people who are various stages of mental ill health i'm really empathetic and you know sure trying to you know talk to that person about feelings i feel really i'm really good at it when there's no personal sure yes yeah yeah right i think you know how to do it professionally sure right i i mean i think you got to where you are because you probably are a empathic and compassionate person to work under so not i don't want to push you or rush genuinely so i think you have to do this when you're ready but i i do think in terms of the list of things to do i think having like you don't even have to have a conversation because i don't know that your dad is going to know what to do with that right but like formulating some kind of like like sharing some of these feelings with your dad and say like you know dad i've come a really long way like i know y'all are proud of me and and i just want to share with you that you know i know you've made a lot of sacrifices and sometimes it hurts me to think about what you've had to give up with your life for our sake i sometimes think it's almost like a tragedy that like you've you've had to do this i know you did it willingly i know you're proud of it i know you did your duty i know you did it because you love us but on some level it still hurts me to think about the sacrifices that you were forced to make and i appreciate so much about like how lucky i've been and the opportunities that you've given me that i don't have to walk that path how does that yeah it feels good to just imagine saying it i'm not sure if it's selfish to say it he's just going to make me feel good that i'm trying to make my dad feel good or something because i'm not i'm not sure well i don't know he's quite stoic and flippant so yeah i don't know don't trick yourself into not saying it no i will do it oh it's selfish no no yeah yeah no say that again yeah so uh so uh i will do it you're suggesting i'll do it i'm not suggesting it i'm asking how it would feel feel good okay so then i think you should do it right and like i don't know how else to say this but like you're not gonna live andy until you do that okay right i know that sounds kind of weird but like what i mean is like this is life like when you feel hollow and empty inside it's because there are huge parts of you that are like in the basement like you can't live a full life you can't live you can't find happiness unless you engage with this stuff okay does that make sense it's just like yeah yeah you know yeah yeah your life is you're you're like a movie like your life is two-dimensional and has all the attributes of a real story but isn't you know you see the people like the water on the screen isn't wet right and like what i'm getting a sense of is that your life is like that where you're like you have this surface level like everything's go like you're living it but it's all like hollow and empty inside because the water on the screen isn't wet and some of that like because you gotta you know because there's a whole treasure trove of stuff there and like i i want to bet money that if you have a conversation like this with your dad you will feel more alive for the next week there's no way that you're going to feel empty during that you're not going to feel good necessarily it's going to be like good and bad and everything in between but does that make sense it makes a lot of sense here right so i think you know sharing that with him i've done my best to try to understand what you may have been feeling so you know you can adapt that or whatever yeah yeah yeah but i i think sort of sharing with him you know some of this stuff and like recognizing that he may not know how to respond right and not that he needs to it's also good that you're also recognizing like what what do you think his response could be yeah and then i feel a bit guilty about my mum because you know she's been there through the whole thing no i had a career in things but i don't think about i don't think about that as much sure why is that that's strange because she sacrifices as much i don't know yeah i mean so i you know i wouldn't so so just be prepared for him to deflect or make a joke or things like that right so like he may not be ready to hear it it may be too much for him to handle so and i don't want you to get hurt or turned off by that okay right and then like you can revisit it again but like a lot of this stuff is about almost also from a karmic perspective like completing your karma like you can't force him to do anything but for your growth like you need to speak your truth because the reason you're not happy and you feel empty inside andy is because for a long time you've stopped speaking your truth okay does that make sense to you it makes sense yeah it makes great yeah it makes sense yeah yeah it's just kind of elucidated a lot yeah i feel like again you've kind of shown a light on the map forward cool that's what we're here for thoughts questions well i'm a bit disappointed that i'm sitting down with a therapist not in therapy and actually the most stereotypical epiphany has been given to me or i've taken it which is it's your relationship with your dad but it is what it is yeah i need to work on it yeah it's just a reason i mean so i i'd like to say it's more than that right but but i i think we've given you a lot of stuff but i think start your journey with what fits right to you yeah and i think even then it's not when you when we talk about relationship with our dad there's an assumption that there's a bad relationship whereas i think what you need to do for your dad is like express gratitude okay right and at a level that makes him deeply deeply uncomfortable yeah right like you need to tell him that you love him and you appreciate his sacrifice and like everything that he's done for you and it makes you sad to think about what he's had to give up for your sake and that you're so grateful that he's given you opportunities got you that first job got you that first managerial position and that your life is good and that all of the success that you have has come off of the back of like his sacrifice and your mom's sacrifice and that means a lot to you yeah okay then you'll feel alive okay yeah and then with that just try and try not to dilute my personality while i'm working what do you mean i didn't follow just sorry separately from that just i'm trying to kind of think about i'll need to rewatch the vlog i can't believe it's the time that it is i'm so grateful i've spent a bit longer with me um the part about kind of my personality at work not diluting it yeah so i i i'd catch so it starts with just catching your contrary statements right the devaluing statements yeah um you know i think it's i think there's you know especially with people like michelle like there's a certain amount of romantic relationships that only function because we squash a part of ourselves it's the only way they work right like for the sake of harmony you have to you have to you know you can't be your true authentic self with a romantic partner in fact a lot of i mean i don't mean to be it i think it's natural and healthy yeah yeah but also like for you know crack a joke from time to time and and let yourself out a little bit like if i had to say one thing andy you haven't let yourself out in a long time yeah you know i feel like i don't look at it you know i got this kind of featureless face that doesn't really move but uh it's not botox obviously wrinkles but um i feel very excited to have that conversation yeah and i think that by the way your your face is not featureless it's only featureless when you're operating from one of those sides and seriously i think it'd be a really interesting exercise to watch this interview on mute yeah okay i'll do that and then you'll just see so last question that i have is that um oftentimes at the end of of conversations with people i'll teach them in some kind of instruction of of meditation are you interested in learning that yeah yeah do you want a mystical one or a more scientific one one the best most effective if that's the mystical one fine what do you think's the best i had thought about you ahead of time and i had the idea to teach you a mantra and give you a mantra or mantra so it's a syllable that you should chant do you have a set of prayer beads or or rosary or anything like that i've lost my prayer beads okay um so i don't have anything that's okay so you don't need one but it can help with the practice so uh i'm just trying to think about because i think who you are is very different from who i thought you would be and i'm just trying to think a little bit about how do you think i would i don't know i'm glad that you are who you are thank you i'm just trying to think about whether i should because i had this flash of inspiration about half an hour before stream that i wanted to teach you a mantra and i'm just trying to figure out where that inspiration is coming from and if it was wrong or if it was actually right and is like more predictive so let's just stick with it so i'm going to stick with it okay so i'm going to teach you a mantra so the mantra is going to be kind of weird um so it's the mantra is oh this actually makes perfect sense now so the mantra is actually very guttural okay that's interesting okay so the mantra is is this [Music] [Music] okay [Music] you want to do that [Music] did you hear that i don't know if this court stopped with me no it did yeah you just you're just kind of staring at me okay so the mantra is chum yeah so it starts with it's like a ksh okay and then in the bottom of your throat there's going to be a [Music] beautiful so what we want you to do is you're going to take it it's going to start with a sha you're going to be doing an uh if you've got the covid you don't have to do it now you got the rona i'll give it a go so and then hold that ooh the the should be short and the um should be short at the end and then we're going to end with okay so [Music] got it good you're doing it right it's just the first syllable [Music] so with a cha that your tongue is at the top of your palate right so if you say cha cha cha cha cha the back of your tongue is at the back of your palate so do it with me cha cha cha cha cha cha cha cha cha cha do you feel where your tongue is uh-huh okay now shasha sha what's different my tongue is in the middle of my mouth so now you'll get there it's okay i don't think i will sha sha shasha so the reason you're getting there is because the car is also at the back of your pallet does that make sense is going to be further at the back of your pallet so it's almost like the cause over here the jaws over here and the sha is over here so what you need to do is skip that cha in the middle i know it's kind of weird but so do it again can you say rickshaw rickshaw there we go thank you chat okay right shock show dude that was brilliant okay okay thank you yeah whoever came up with i would never thought of that so rickshaw joe rickshaw yes right so that shot [ __ ] yeah okay you got it got it good okay yeah okay and then the the main part of it is [Music] good beautiful it's my throat has been soft yeah so don't don't do it now don't do it you don't have to do it now so we won't we won't practice now okay but what i would do is is you know i would start with like maybe you can start with like nine breaths so wait till you're done being sick yeah so do nine breaths like nine rounds if you can then extend to like five minutes then 15 minutes um if you are open to something a little bit you know it's not really religious but it's a tool for practice but there's you can get like a set of prayer beads so eastern prayer beads are going to be 108 beads and so you want to do 108 rounds it'll take you maybe somewhere between 15 and 30 minutes which is totally fine presuming you're okay doing it the other thing i have to tell huh sorry i'll watch the vlog yeah so 108 rounds so that means doing the mantra 108 times that should be your end goal now a couple of things to remember about this stuff you don't necessarily have to believe in that that's okay if you're willing to give it a shot that's totally fine it's also completely fine if you decide to not do this for a while the one thing i want to ask you is don't forget about it so it may be a year it may be two it may be three and if you want to understand yourself chant trump if you want to be happy it's what's missing from your life which i know sounds weird okay the reason yeah yeah go ahead yeah that's my question is what's the difference between that and something like the uh thing what's the difference between which one you do the difference has to do with the specific is the specific spiritual energies that you want to cultivate okay now that's the actual difference so scientifically we do know that mantra meditation has different creates different eeg patterns so different electrical activity in the brain compared to other kinds of meditation but i've never seen a study that compares one kind of mantra to another so there is scientific evidence that mantra meditation is different from like meditating on your breath or something like that so in my experience the reason that i teach this stuff even though there does not have scientific credibility behind it is because my personal experience and the the people that i will teach these mantras to tend to do really well and after a while if they stick with it they come back to me and they say the same thing that i discovered about my mother which is like that was absolutely the right mantra and then like you can ask them like how do you know it's that what does that mean and it's like hard to describe but it's just sort of it you just do it for a while and you'll understand yeah right because remember it's it's subjective it's experiential cool i'm looking forward to doing it okay cool open-minded yeah you don't need to know how it works it just needs to work yeah right so i almost say it's kind of like exercise like you don't need to know how muscles get built you just need to do it for a while the other thing that i feel pretty good about is that you know generally speaking all the benefits of mindfulness reductions in depression reductions and anxiety improvement of compassion improvement of empathy greater self-understanding like all those things are scientific and you'll get that stuff too yeah cool cool any last thoughts yeah you're very welcome any last thoughts or questions before we wrap up for the day uh i guess i just expressed my gratitude final time i'm uh so grateful and uh kind of excited i feel good i feel you know like i've got a path forward at least um i'm tempted about even giving you my prime subscription to toss up between you and amaranth at the minute but um i think you i think you're gonna get it so thank you very much yeah thanks for the price up uh much appreciate it but you know yes you may get you get more of your money's worth from amaranth i'm not not sure that you know i wouldn't know i i i i just watched the uh the session you did with her and other than the um the zombie dog dream which sounded horrifying uh i found a lot of parallels that was quite surprised interesting yeah anyway i don't know why any of your time you've been modern generous so thank you so much i look forward to watching the vlog thank you very much for coming on and and i'm going to let that last comment slide but um seriously dude thank you very much i wish you all the best of luck and uh yeah so we'll well our team will send you one or two other things okay after work we wrap up today yeah take care man bye thank you bye you
