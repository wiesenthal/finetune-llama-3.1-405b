what does that mean good enough that doesn't make any sense what are you talking about doesn't know the good enough version is the perfect version the only version of me that's acceptable is perfection so 31m feeling ashamed for a lack of success tldr what does great progress look like for someone who suffers from shame what else can i do to further reduce or eliminate feelings of shame i 31 m understand my shame as something tied to my ideal self and where i would be at my age earn x dollars as monthly recurring revenue earn y dollars as a salary for my job it's tied to some peculiar behavior such as crumping crunching numbers repeatedly on things relating to money such as investments monthly recurring revenue cost of employees etc seemingly shy away from others i perceive as more successful or have their crap together better than i i've been practicing own breathing exercises and it seems to dissipate my emotional shame when i'm not at a place where i can ohm out loud i can mentally rehearse this meditative practice has helped me feel better however i want to take things to the next level dr k's videos on shame for those who might need it uh why shame is the raid boss of emotions and how to overcome shame and feeling like a failure i still feel like i still feel myself freezing up from time to time i lost my job two months ago and two key clients i've had what seems to be depressive episodes about it and also some issues with other matters i still have clients i'm on ei i'm not sure what that is employment insurance maybe things are fine so far so maybe i'm not as bad as bad shame as i think i am my definition of success seems to be screwing me up besides practicing home exercises taking showers grooming myself and clean my home whenever these episodes or emotions hit hard has also helped taking care of things i've been putting off in my personal life too i seem to neglect my personal life including taxes my romantic relationship and taking charge of my home what i want it to be with my fiance what would progress look like for someone struggling with freezing up with shame where you as i would describe have gotten over the initial hump in handling the shame to some degree plus want to really silence the emotional shame from yourself to do an excellent job managing it which is the reasonable possibility i'll keep practicing what works for me and trying new things i'm just not sure what to expect over time and whether there is something different i need to do like forming an accountability group for business owners any and all inputs greatly appreciated so here's the tricky thing about shame sometimes we feel ashamed of ourselves and much like this person if we introspect and this person has done a lot of good work we sort of recognize that we have this idea of our ideal self right there's a version of me who would be making this much money would be doing particular things and i just don't live up to that standard so i feel ashamed of myself and then i shy away from other people who i think live up to that standard right because sometimes what we hate the most is someone who succeeds at the things that we want to do but aren't able to and so spending time with certain people just makes you feel more ashamed of yourself because you're trying to live up to the standard the tricky thing here is that as we try to live up to the standard we actually will do a lot of work right so sometimes we start to make progress on the shame we start meditating a lot we start to you know because like here's the ideal self here's me and i want to catch up to that right so i need to start doing better doing better doing better doing better doing better because that's how you fix shame right the antidote to shame is achievement right if i made that much money i wouldn't feel ashamed of myself anymore something subtle here something very tricky because we all think that the antidote to shame is achievement because i'm ashamed because i don't achieve so if i achieve i'll be totally fine but if you'll pay attention to this post you'll see a couple of interesting things it seems like the person is engaged seems like they're a business owner seems like they lost a couple of clients but they still have a couple of clients and if you also pay attention they also crunch the numbers over and over and over again and i wouldn't be surprised if this person moves the goal posts right because sometimes when we're ashamed of ourselves there's this ideal self and no matter how we calculate we're never we never live up to the ideal and so the really tricky thing about being ashamed of yourself is that you think that the way to solve it is by achievement but the tricky thing is that achievement and will explain how actually reinforces the shame so let's try to understand this okay the first thing to uh kind of look at is that shame operates in our self in different ways okay so this person does a good job of this where they sort of say that okay i meditate and that dissipates my emotional shame so sometimes if we look at shame there seem to be different levels of emotional of shame so one of the levels is emotional and what does that mean that means that at times i experience an acute emotion right so i have particular thoughts in my head my chest starts to constrict i have a lump in my throat i feel like fleeing somewhere i hear that someone more successful than me is going to be at this party and i feel embarrassed to go and so i tighten up i freeze up and there's like this very acute in the moment experience of emotional shame now and then this person has said okay so i've started meditating i do om chanting props and that's helped with that but it doesn't seem to fix the other stuff right so meditating it away like the problem isn't fixed and that's a good point it's an excellent observation and this is what i really love about these posts in this community is y'all are learning the original tricks and now what you're learning is that the problem is more complex so it turns out that shame is way more than an emotion so let's start to understand what are the other components of it so there is identity okay so what does that mean so if we go back to the post ideal self so i want you all to pay attention to this okay so let's take a look so here's my ideal self which earns x number of dollars per day and here's my current self the gap between these two things is where the shame comes from let's say i'm currently earning eight dollars okay do you all see that so as long as this ideal self exists the shame is a gap between where you are now and where you think you should be if these two things were the same there would be no room for the shame which makes perfect sense because that's why i think that achievement is the answer right because achievement is how i go from my current self to my ideal self the tricky thing is that's not quite how it works the tricky thing is that achievement actually reinforces the problem let me explain to y'all why so the idea of an ideal self is not a real thing you can't be perfect you're never going to be perfect right so even if you you know if you're here let's say and this is what's so tricky about shame oh it's not okay whatever busted scuffed so we have our current self we have the ideal self and this by the way is born of a hamkar from the sanskrit okay and achievement is what gets us from here to here but if you look at people who are ashamed of themselves there's something very very tricky going on in this thought process which is that we tend to move the goal posts and what we're going to do is look at this person's thought process and this is the third dimension that we're going to talk about how the thoughts of shame exist okay so we're going to look at these thoughts very carefully so i'll tell you all why i think achieving the ideal is an impossibility for this person so feeling ashamed for lack of success what does great progress look like suddenly progress isn't enough right so this person has made progress they started doing ohm chanting they're dealing with their emotional shame and do they feel proud of themselves no no no they need great progress do you all see that it's subtle so here's what happened there was a current self they felt x amount of shame they started meditating they got better and did they feel proud of themselves they say good job pat on the back i've taken one step forward towards conquering my shame no no no no so then the ideal self gets moved down here and now i have more stuff to do right this was insufficient and we can see this in other places as well crunching numbers repeatedly on things like money relating to money investments so what i think is going on here is that if they make x number of dollars as we crunch the numbers because we feel ashamed of ourself as we as this becomes x this is going to become y y'all see that so the tricky thing about shame is that it's built on this idea of an ideal self it's this idea that like there is this perfect version of you out there and you should be ashamed until you reach that point the problem is that in that kind of situation no amount of achievement is ever going to work because it's still you still have this idea of the ideal self which is going to be moved around or you're going to keep moving the goal goalposts right so the interesting thing is that what we know about shame is not about achievement but actually getting rid of this entirely this is the next step it's not just an emotion it's about acknowledging that the shame comes from a gap between where you believe you should be and where you are and that actually letting go of that ideal self being able to say oh like there's actually like it's not it's not the the antidote to shame is not achievement it's acknowledging and realizing and having compassion that there's no reason to be ashamed to begin with so i'll give y'all just a simple example of this you may sound like that's insane if you're ashamed of yourself what do you mean achievement won't work that's ridiculous like i need to achieve more so i'll give you all a good example of this sometimes kids who are in abusive situations physical abuse emotional abuse sexual abuse feel ashamed of themselves now do you think that this is something that they can achieve their way out of no it's absurd it's absolutely absurd when a child feels ashamed because they're being abused the antidote is not them doing a better job but that's what they try to do right if you all have worked with people or heaven forbid you've been through abuse yourself you know that even if one of your parents is emotionally abusive you try really really really hard to make them happy and achieve be a good boy or a good girl you know be the person that be a good kid for your parents and there's no way that that's going to work the solution to that in therapy is going to be in acknowledging that like you don't need to achieve anything that you're actually great the way that you are and you have no reason to be ashamed i mean there's good reasons why you feel that way but like that that's actually not a correct way of looking at your situation and we sort of see this from a yogic perspective as well when we kind of look at this concept of a hum god right this concept of a hum god is the i feeling or the ego and the solution to that the way to get free of your ego is not to satisfy everything that your ego wants so if i like if i want to be the richest person on the planet or i want to be the sexiest person on the planet that one are already done right so i can attest to that that doesn't satisfy you you need more right so that's not how it works like achievement doesn't the ego is always going to want more like you always want another promotion there's always going to be something going on the ego loves to move goal posts so what we need to do is actually abandon that ideal self and that's where it's like i know it sounds kind of weird but like what does that mean abandon the ideal self that means that except who you are right that's what that when we talk about accepting it's like okay so i didn't make that much amount of money this is like where i can improve because you can definitely improve we're not saying stop improving but there's a difference between taking one step forward and one step towards an unreachable goal both of them are one step but they feel very different one of them is progress the other one is completely insufficient you all get that and so one is going to make you feel more ashamed and one is going to make you feel proud even though the step is the same so did you clean more than tomorrow i mean than yesterday that's something to be proud of whereas if i think oh my god i haven't cleaned anywhere near enough cleaning a little bit is not enough so you beat yourself up and feel ashamed and then think about what you're doing progress becomes something for you to be ashamed of and then how are you ever going to get out of that situation when actual progress makes you feel ashamed you're screwed you'll get that so you have to let go of that ideal self there is no ideal self there's just you and once you realize that you'll realize something even is the beginning it's terrifying you're like what do you mean there's just me what do you mean there's no perfect there ain't no perfect version of you there's just you you know what's an even more terrifying thought the version of you that there is is good enough what does that mean good enough that doesn't make any sense what are you talking about this is no the good enough version is the perfect version the only version of me that's acceptable is perfection and as long as you believe that how is achievement ever going to fix it just think about it for a second the only version of me that's good enough has to be perfect well you're like kind of screwed there like that's an unwinnable game that you're setting up for yourself so this is a subtlety about shame is that what we automatically think is that the gap between the ideal self and the the current self if we achieve that gap if we bridge that gap that's how we're going to be successful but that isn't the case make sense it's okay to have ideals it's okay to move towards things but it starts with acceptance so the third dimension of shame that we're going to talk a little bit about is the thoughts okay so the other thing that you can do is catch the thoughts of shame so we shared one with you but we're gonna like look at them right so this i love this word subtle oh you oh hold on i can't see this so let's start by catching the thoughts catch the thought of shame so you'll see that something about your thought process sets you up for failure and it's little words like this what does great progress look like hold on a second so what does great progress look like for someone who suffers from shame it's this concept of great progress right that's a thought that is born of the shame because progress is no longer enough so we see this crunching numbers repeatedly on things relating to money investments monthly recurring revenue etc etc right so you're going to constantly be changing the way that you look at things and you know like it's subtle but there's there's little things that are are kind of like baked in throughout this kind of thing so for example you know they feel like they're neglecting their personal life they're neglecting their taxes their romantic relationship i'm not saying that they couldn't be doing better but they also have a fiance you know they they run their own business they're meditating every day right so there's a subtlety in the way that your thoughts will actually construct ways for you to fall short and that's what you need to be really careful about is that shame manifests in the standards that you hold yourself up in it manifests as your actual individual thoughts right and then the last thing that we're going to talk a little bit about is this concept of a samskar or a shame complex so we talk about this concept of some scars and dr k's guide we have videos about them etc so you all can check that stuff out but i think this is where you know why does this ideal self stuff happen in the in the beginning it starts from somewhere right somewhere along the way you learned the lesson that being you is not good enough fundamentally that's where all shame comes from this idea that being you is not good enough and so how do you fix that one way to fix it so you can work on the emotions in the present you can catch some of the thoughts you can work on your sense of identity you can do all those kinds of things the other thing is that honestly you can go to therapy so a lot of like toxic shame work can be done in therapy and what you're trying to do in therapy is is you're trying to sort of digest the shame complex where did you discover that what you are isn't good enough and so one of the key things about shame that we kind of see here so this person does a great job of sharing that you can be 31 and ashamed of your lack of success and it turns out that when most people feel ashamed what they try to do is achieve their way out of it right because if i'm ashamed of my achievements then if i achieve more i won't be ashamed the tricky thing is that despite progress and achievement what we oftentimes find is that the shame actually doesn't get better which is very strange because we thought we could achieve our way out of it and why does that happen for a couple of important reasons the first is that we tend to move the goal posts for ourselves and so that's another thought that you can catch the second is that the idea of the shame is born out of the ideal self right because shame is the gap between where you want to be and where you are and as long as this dichotomy exists the shame will live in the middle so even as i move forward right i'm going to move further and further away the ideal self grows and changes so you can't have shame without the ideal self and so that's the identity aspect of shame there's an emotional aspect of shame which this person has done meditation and things like that and then you can actually catch the manifestations of this shame complex in your mind with little things like great progress right so here's the key thing is ask yourself why the progress isn't enough and your mind will give you lots of answers and then notice the answers and then start to notice will this part of my mind ever be satisfied if i did more would it be satisfied if i cleaned tomorrow would it be satisfied if i cleaned the next day would it be satisfied if i did my taxes would it be satisfied no because all of those thoughts are born out of the shame complex and that chain shame complex or some scar is something that you can eventually get to the root of so that's when you're working with someone usually i mean people do this in yoga ashrams as well where they'll get to the root of their some scars but that's where i think therapy is probably the best thing to get to the root of that shame complex now a lot of this stuff coaching can help with i'd say especially you know if you're like this person and you are concerned that you could be suffering from depression or something like that absolutely go see a licensed mental health professional but our coaches are taught this model and the key thing that they really focus on is not just digesting the shame it's about helping you understand your thought process and not let shame get in the way of your goals so for example like you know i would expect coaches to help with something like this shying away from others i perceive as having they're crap together are better than i am right so like they're they're behavioral things that shame may be getting in the way of and so if your shame is getting in the way of stuff then like coaching is good not a bad idea to get a mental health evaluation though if you're kind of in this boat because sometimes shame can be a manifestation of negative self-attitude that is part of a mental health condition that requires treatment okay okay so shadow 7578 is saying i know that the root are my parents but what's next how do you deal with the root so in my experience sometimes we think we know what the route is but we may be surprised so i would say in fact the majority of people that i've worked with and even the majority of people in the coaching program our coaching clients have discovered that the root that they thought it was is actually somewhat different than what they conceptualized because it's it's not just your parents right it's it's the shame is not your parents it's which of your parents beliefs did you internalize because you keep it alive and understanding that is very important so the next step would be sort of not just the parents but what did you start to believe about yourself because of what your parents said or why did you start to believe it for yourself does that make sense you
