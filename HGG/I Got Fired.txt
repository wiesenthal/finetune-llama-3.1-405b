so let's take a look at this post by someone who got fired from the job i got fired from my job because i was really unhappy and was also vocal about it and i was also caught taking interviews for other jobs on company time it's a weird situation because i liked my job and was good at it but i hated the company i worked for i'm feeling all sorts of things shock relief anxiety excitement any tips for how to process big events like this thanks in advance i love this community um so what we're going to talk about today we're going to go into more detail in a second but like what does it mean for like how do you process this like what is the process of processing so i've worked with a lot of people who have gone through large events right everything from having their first child to getting fired to being sexually assaulted and so how do you help someone what is the process of organizing this experience and like how do you come out a count come out of it on the other side as healthy as possible right so what can we learn from that's what we're going to dig into before we do that we need a little bit more detail okay for sure it's it's a really long story but i'll do my best i was an employee at a co i was a employee i was at an employee-owned company that did really well with a bunch of invested passionate workers during the panda pandemic the company got sold to a mega large corporation and they started making changes the changes were expected but most of them were really unfair cutting our sick days more than half worse benefits no options to become an owner leader in the company worse than that was the way that the new company communicated the changes never being straightforward always trying to make the changes seem good for us but when you took a closer look they were basically all negatives i found that at best unkind and careless and at worst insulting and dishonest i would regularly talk about how upset this behavior made me with coworkers that i was close with and with some higher up managers that i really felt comfortable talking to silly me we're gonna zero in on that statement later okay so remember that i also spoke up occasionally in meetings when they were when things were really bad i basically felt like i deserved to be treated better and at the very least deserved honesty and that all of us from the old company deserved to be treated better because they were a really strong team and really well respected in the industry in generally in general i'm someone that struggles with perfectionism toxic productivity and letting my emotions be governed by external circumstances or successes sounds sound familiar i've never really failed anything much less been fired another really important thing to point out okay because that'll that'll come in i've been in therapy for a bit but i'm still feeling learning to feel my emotions instead of suppressing them but it sometimes is still scary or hard for me i fall back on my coping mechanism when i'm stressed a lot some healthy gym going for walks and some not not smoking a ton of dope i guess i'm just looking for some support and tips for processing the feelings in a healthy way even typing this out feels like it's helped already look at that hope that clarifies a bit okay so what does it mean to process as we go through life things happen to us right and those things aren't necessarily good and when bad things happen to us there's this idea that like if you process it correctly you'll be like stronger afterward right so how like and so everyone's kind of thinking like oh like i'm still processing like i want to process like you know i need to process this how do i process this correctly but i've never seen anyone that says here is how you process here are the steps here the goals this is what we should do here's the game plan okay if you do this stuff you will process and it'll be great now we learned this stuff as clinicians right even then like i was never taught in therapy like this is what you do it was never described to me like that it's like here are the skills that we teach here's a bunch of weird like psychological principles like jung's shadow the edible complex here's eric's ericsson stages of conflict and growth and stuff like that that here's maslow's hierarchy of needs and self-actualization you know here's aaron beck's model of the mind here's judith back's like improvement on the model of the mind here's sigmund freud's theories here's anna freud's defense mechanisms but nowhere in my therapy training which you know was okay but maybe not the best you know who knows i'm not saying it isn't taught elsewhere no one was like when someone comes in here's what you should do a b c d e f g so we get some of that with cognitive behavioral therapy or dialectical behavioral therapy or manualized therapy so we do get that right but we don't get that for something like this right so it's therapy you'll you'll learn manualized treatment for here's how you deal with someone who has uh you know a social phobia right like here's exposure therapy here are the steps of exposure therapy but in training to become a therapist you focus on clinical problems you don't focus on non-clinical problems so they don't like you're not going to learn like if you're becoming a psychiatrist or a psychologist at least in most places you're not going to learn like how do you what's the game plan what's the manualized treatment for someone who's been fired for the first time in their life because it's not an illness right so we'll have manualized treatments for illness but we won't have like manualized treatments for stuff that happens in life so now what i'd like to do today is is talk to you all a little bit about like what it means to process and so this too like therapists can absolutely help you do because like we learn all the steps for clinical stuff and then in practically in our day job we learn how to like adapt these things to non-clinical things right so therapists can help you with this stuff but it's not something that's formally tr taught so let's talk a little bit about how do i process okay so the first thing is we have to define processing so here's i here's what i would say like this is just my kind of off the cuff example or framework for understanding processing so the first thing that i'd say is that events have emotional impacts okay so if you get fired for example you're gonna feel betrayed you're gonna feel taken advantage of you're gonna feel incompetent right so you feel like the company let you down maybe this person is feeling betrayed by that manager that they were talking to they're gonna feel abandoned they're gonna feel inadequate right because they've never been fired before there's like two kinds of people in this world right there are people who get promoted and people who get fired and the people who get fired are people who are incompetent right so we'll get to that in a second so you may be feeling all this kind of stuff and then this in turn like these emotions are gonna have like impacts on your body or your life okay so let's remember that like these emotional impacts are not just in your mind right so you may have difficulty sleeping you may have like difficulty with motivation you may feel like it's hard to apply for a job or go to an interview you may feel jaded right and this is where we'll talk about this for a second or we'll you may feel jaded right so all these things are happening okay so one step of processing is going to be like dealing with these emotions and this is sort of the most common thing that people will think about right it's to no longer feel guilty and ashamed but then there's more to it so remember that from the vedic psychology of the mind when we feel negative emotions we have this part of our mind called the ego and the ego's goal is to help us like feel better about ourselves and to develop a sense of identity that helps us navigate the world so emotions then relate to our identity so this is where remember how we said like feeling inadequate so we'll use this as an example there are two kinds of people in this world i have never been fired right and let's look at what this person's identity is so um so i was i liked my job and was good at it was good at my job right and was also like i was worked at an employee-owned company that did really well passionate workers so did well passionate right so now let's let's kind of like look at this for a second right so here's number one number two number three so how do you think before this person got fired like how do you think they thought about themselves right i'm a dedicated person i'm a hard worker i'm a good worker i did well enough to where the company got acquired during the pandemic this is who i am oh thanks for the tons of sub uh subs gifted subs res me please um so this is how you view yourself right and then you get fired and then like now suddenly there's a there's a huge discrepancy between these two things because like here's one kind of person and here's another kind of person who gets fired people who are like lazy people who are incompetent those are the people that get fired right we have this sort of societal conditioning that this is how you get fired and so this creates an identity conflict and then this in turn is going to affect your behaviors okay so once we once our identity gets kind of confused right like are we like am i a good worker or a bad worker like what kind of worker am i so and then you may say like well why is that relevant like what do you mean by that so this is what i mean so when you go to a job interview like how confident are you gonna be right like what are you are you a loser that got fired or are you like someone who is a passionate hard worker who built something with a team of people like it's kind of confusing so processing involves resolving this identity conflict so that it no longer negatively shapes your behaviors right so if we don't resolve it we can have negative behaviors and then if we do resolve it we can actually have positive behaviors after that so let's just look at like the job application and the interview process which is going to be affected by like me getting fired okay so am i a good worker am i a bad worker i don't really know um and so if we think about how we get affected by things so we can see this in the case of trauma as well right so let's say that i get um you know i go through a traumatic experience so like i go to let's say like i'm driving a car one day and um i get hit by another car so there's gonna be like some kind of emotional impact i'm gonna feel afraid right and then like i'm gonna start to wonder am i a bad driver so then like there's fear right and then there's like good driver or bad driver so i i used to pride myself on being a good driver because i had never been in an accident i'm a good driver i've never been in an accident there are all these people out there who are incompetent drivers they get in accidents all the time so it's like an emotional element and then we can see even in this simple example like automatically like am i a good driver or am i a bad driver and you have to kind of like think through that work through that it can even affect your behavior it's like now what's gonna happen is i'ma drive less why because maybe i'm a bad driver oh my god right so my confidence is affected so it's gonna affect my behavior so if we think about processing so what would be the goal of like therapy with this person is to like help them you know digest this fear help them resolve their identity and help them like move their behaviors in the right direction so what would that look like in this case right so this is where like you know if i was this person's um you know if i was working with this person or advising this person like it's not necessarily like a therapeutic thing so i'm not offering medical advice here but like even for my friends for example who have been fired here's how i would help them kind of reconceptualize things i've reconceptualized things myself so i can offer this example as well so you know i would start by sort of acknowledging what you're feeling right and sort of like recognize that this is important so it starts with acknowledgement then what i'd also do for emotional processing is adjust kind of behaviors related to emotion i know we talked about behaviors down here but what i mean by this is like i'd start doing things like going for a walk spending time in nature maybe journaling right and people may be like oh but what good does journaling do boom boom boom that's all you need right so like they didn't say they didn't say it over here this was the first version of the post and then i asked them for more information i commented on this post which sometimes i i do from time to time and then they wrote this and somehow adding this element seems to have helped some so this is the process of acknowledging your emotions right and somehow that's like in and of itself is like healthy and helps people right and then you can also definitely like you know depending on the scale of what you're processing therapy is definitely an option and in fact recommended depending on what happened to you right so if you had a seriously traumatic experience like if you were assaulted or something like that then i think you should absolutely go see a therapist you can also do things like coaching but that also depends on the severity of what you're dealing with so this is where if you're not sure which one's appropriate i would start with just like going to your primary care physician your general practitioner say hey i'm going through this do you think this is something that i would need to see a therapist for right so you should have some kind of medical relationship if you don't have any medical relationship with a general practitioner or primary care physician that everyone should get right so like basic advice is everyone should get an annual physical and see a doctor at least once a year so start there and the reason for that is like you can ask them questions like this right general practitioners they may not be psychiatrists but they'll be able to say like okay like they'll be able to do basic assessments right they're competent mental health and they'll say you know what i think that you would benefit from a referral so coaches can also help with this kind of stuff assuming it's non-clinical in nature so if you have like ptsd or something coaching is not appropriate but if you're trying to figure out like how to you know help like how to manage your emotions and prepare for a job interview that's something that's more aligned with coaching okay next thing that happens is your identity so this is where you got to do some work okay so often times the the work that we have to do with when i say you have to do some work with identity what i mean by that is this not highlight no okay i guess not whatever what i mean by that is that you have to sort of come to terms with who you are now and like do some kind of work so i'll give you guys an example of what i did so there are smart kids and there are stupid kids smart kids have good gpas this is what used to happen in my mind stupid kids have bad gpas okay smart kids become doctors and stupid kids don't become doctors so i'm applying to medical school right am i a smart kid or i'm a stupid kid i was told growing up that i'm a smart kid but i have a bad gpa and i certainly haven't been getting into medical school so my ego was hurting my identity was hurting i felt like you know am i stupid or am i smart i felt dumb and i started to like really think about it and kind of work through it and then what happens is at some point and i imagine this is the case for this person as well i've i wound up in a medical school interview right so and this person will probably wind up in a job interview at some point and if you've gotten fired one of the most terrifying things to think about is like they're going to ask you what happened at your last job and then you don't want to say or admit or and because all the shame that comes with like i was fired because then they're going to think you're in this bucket right but you like don't want to lie so like how do you manage that so here's what i said in my medical interview they asked me like what's up with your gpa and i said well like when i was in college like i really didn't know what i wanted to do in life and so i didn't apply myself in school and so i got a bad gpa this is the third year i'm applying to medical school you know i've taken more and more classes since then if you look at the last two years of the classes i've taken my gpa is pretty good so i realized like this is actually what i want to do and i recognize that a lot of people would have quit because good gpas are a requirement to get into medical school and i recognize that i don't meet that requirement but i'm dedicated to doing this i've worked my ass off i've gotten a good gpa the last two years and if y'all let me into your school i can guarantee you i'm not going to slack off i've slacked off once in my life and i've learned the consequences of slacking off and i can guarantee you that i will work really really hard if given this opportunity and even though i've been given other opportunities to switch careers this is what i'm really dedicated towards i realize it's a long shot but i have my heart set on it i'm willing to do whatever it takes you own it right so like that's an identity thing that you have to like you have to arrive at that conclusion and you have to say i'm not i don't have a good gpa but it's not about being a smart kid or a stupid kid like neither of those things apply i did not talk about smart or stupid at all i want to become a doctor this is what i want this is what i have this is what i can offer and so very concretely like this person is going to be thinking a little bit about what to say in the job interview because you got fired right so this is what i would if i was in this person's shoes is what i would say so i'm dedicated and i'm hard working i was at an employee-owned company and we did such a good job during the pandemic that a public company wanted to acquire us once the public company acquired us they started to institute some changes i'm a hard worker who's willing to go the extra mile but as they instituted more and more changes i thought that those were unfair so they cut back on our vacation they did this they did this they did this so i voiced my concerns to upper management because i believe in providing useful feedback to my employer i do believe it is because i provided useful feedback in my old company that we did as well as we did right so when i saw problems at work i would voice my concerns about them they would sort of get addressed and then like we did better as a whole team and so i'm a team player i'm a hard worker but the company didn't really like that i was you know asking for things that i felt were fair and so i think that those are good i think the fact that the company is profitable profitable and got acquired is like a sign that what i was doing as well and if you let me come work for you this is what you can expect i'm going to work really hard i'm going to be really invested you can talk a little bit about that perfectionism and you don't want to talk about that in the interview but i think it's okay and at the same time like you know i if i have concerns with the way that the business is operating i would hope that you know you would have an open mind to like those concerns i'm not necessarily saying that you guys need to do it but i'm someone who tends to provide feedback for the goal of like improving the mission of what we do here and i was at a company that didn't want that right so they fired me which i think is okay like i don't think it was a good fit so if you want someone who is a team player a hard worker and can build a business to the point where it's like lucrative and a lucrative acquisition then i'm your person but if you're looking for someone who you know is like if you all are looking to actually i wouldn't say i wouldn't add a butt i would just stop there right so you can own who you are and you can own the fact that you got fired and so you can sort of like let them make a decision on that right so be the person that you are and recognize that you know you have to be a little bit calculating there because but if you want yeah you should just stop there so there's some calculation here where you got to play play you know a little bit of the game of like putting forward your best foot you don't want to come across as a troublemaker but at the same time you want to say like i share feedback with with things and based on that feedback like things got better right and so i found that i was at a company that was really not interested in like the opinions of their employees um was not interested in feedback and i didn't do anything negligent right they just decided to fire me which is fine like that's okay if they don't want me there i know i bring a lot of value to whatever team i'm on i think the key thing that i would highlight here for this person's case is that the company got acquired which means you were doing something right okay and so that's when we kind of get to so as you work through that right so then you think a little bit about okay why did i get fired and like the answer is like you got fired because you are willing to work hard right you have some of that toxic productivity but you're learning to set boundaries and so you didn't get fired because you were incompetent maybe you got fired because you were taking interviews on company time so that's a mistake right so you got to be careful about that right so if they're paying you for an hour of work and you are doing something that is personally beneficial on company time that's something that you should be careful about but if the reason that you got fired is because you were setting boundaries with your employer and they did not like those boundaries and chose to fire you i think that's fine right that's something that like you should do and is healthy for you because you don't want to stay at that company like if they're cutting back on all your stuff and expecting the same level of work from you and not compensating you the same way then that's like not really fair for you there may be some considerations there like if they're acquiring you and because of the pandemic if business is slow or things like that if this is there's also an assumption i have here that this is like not a consolidation because things are bad and this is because y'all were doing a good job so there's some aspects like that where companies have to make adjustments during difficult times and so but i'm not hearing that you know that's actually what is going on and so what i what i'm hearing about why you got fired is maybe you were you did kind of screw up if you were like doing non-company work on company time and the second thing is that like you were trying to set healthy boundaries for yourself and you want to be at a company where people like listen to what you have to say and you like get treated with respect which i think is totally fine and if they don't if they want to fire you like that's okay you can choose to part ways right being being fired doesn't mean that you're bad at your job it just means that your employer no longer wants you doing that job because of all kinds of factors so just like quitting doesn't like if i quit my job that doesn't mean that the job is bad it just means i don't want to do it anymore right it doesn't mean that the employer is bad like i quit my job at harvard medical school in massachusetts general hospital it's a wonderful place to work it's just not the work that i wanted to do doesn't say anything bad about those things right like they're still wonderful institutions it's fantastic jobs it's just not the one that i wanted and similarly like from an identity perspective getting fired doesn't necessarily mean you were a bad person or bad at your job it just means that your employer no longer wants you working in that position like there was someone recently like who laid off like a thousand people on zoom right for like better.com or something and like that may have nothing to do with those people's work performance it doesn't mean that you're bad at your job like i don't know the details of that but people fire employees like an employment agreement is like between a company and an employee right like so you've got two parties that agree that okay there's this is an exchange of stuff that we are both comfortable with and then either of those parties can say hey we're no longer we're gonna break up and just because you break up does not mean that like you are deficient or they are deficient sometimes it does but doesn't always mean that okay so now let's talk a little bit about behaviors so this is where you've got to be a little careful okay so if you're thinking about behaviors like what should i do next time so this is the last piece of processing so once we process our emotions once we sort of work through our sense of identity and come to terms with who we are we have to integrate our experience for the future so this is the final step of processing so how am i going to take everything that's happened and what am i gonna do tomorrow so in the case of the car accident like how am i gonna drive okay i'm gonna well i was like i'm oftentimes texting while i'm driving so maybe i shouldn't do that right so you can like change what you do okay so from from a business perspective like how should you change your behavior so the first thing is i would be a little bit careful about delivering feedback willy-nilly so like if you're just kind of like delivering feedback all the time uh so like constantly versus in a focused way i think that may not be good because this delivering feedback all the time is complaining so you're gonna come across in the workplace as like someone who just complains and the interesting thing is that like the more often you say it like the less likely people people are to take you seriously so if your mom is like nagging you about doing laundry and she tells you every 10 minutes hey put away the laundry put away the laundry put away the laundry put away the laundry she may have a point you may have said you were gonna do it but what does it incline you to do like i don't want to do that right so it's like so i would adjust the way that you deliver your feedback for sure so if you have like particular complaints like i would synthesize them deliver them like succinctly to your boss and say hey here's some concerns i have what do you think about these concerns so i do not think that so this is the key thing so here's a problem so sometimes when people end up in this situation i see a lot of this like sentiment on the internet that i would regularly talk about how this behavior upset me with my co-workers and i was close with him with with some higher up managers i felt really comfortable talking to silly me so the lesson that this person is taking away is don't talk to your managers about what you are unhappy with this is a dangerous lesson to learn in my mind this is the equivalent of stop driving right so this is where the place you work is very very important because ideally like the best working scenario is where you can talk to your hire managers and if you're a good manager you want your employees talking to you about what's hard right so i'll give you guys just a quick example about this so when i was working when i was in residency at mgh um there was an issue where we would be on backup call so what backup call means is that like some people are on call every single day and then you have a week of backup call which means that if someone gets sick somewhere in the hospital you're the person who has to fill in if it's a vital kind of thing right so if someone like if someone is managing the emergency room overnight if someone is doing consults in the hospital overnight and they get sick and they can't reschedule because like you know you can't close the emergency room because a doctor isn't working there and called in sick right it's not like an outpatient office where you can take a day off like there's some things that you have to have a doctor there so you have a person who's designated as backup so the problem was that what would happen is like the utilization in the hospital was so high like the residency was big right so we've got like let me think make sure i have this right we have like 50 some odd residents okay so and they're filling all these different roles at like different hospitals so there's like a handful of hospitals you've got 50 residents on a week of backup there's like a 60 to 70 chance on any given day that you get called in so like 60 70 of the time like you can expect to work three or four of those days now the challenge is that when you work those days like you have to stop doing your job so your job is non-vital so you're doing outpatient medicine so i have my like therapy appointments and things like that right so those can be rescheduled it's non-emerge it's non-emergent things doesn't mean that they're not important but it's non-emergent so i can reschedule like a psycho farm appointment if i need to so we were kind of frustrated with this because basically what happened is on the week of backup like we would have to reschedule a bunch of patients because we knew we were going to get called and we didn't know which day we were going to get called in but chances are we're going to get called in statistically right which means then i have to like make eight phone calls reschedule eight patients adjust my schedule and all that kind of stuff and i do that once i've gotten called in so they call me at like let's say i've got therapy appointments tomorrow morning at eight am and i got get called at seven pm hey the overnight person is sick so i go to the hospital at 7 pm and then like while i'm working in the emergency room i have to cancel my 8 am appointment with someone else so i call them at like 8 p.m and i'm like hey i got to cancel my appointment they may not get it in time they may wake up tomorrow not realize it whatever so our program went to our program leadership and we're like hey this is super frustrating and it's like really hard for us because we have to like cancel patients all the time so based on that feedback our program leadership was awesome by the way and they were like okay so this is what we're gonna have you do basically from here on forward when you are on primary backup you no longer need to go to work because you all get called in so much right so we like presented the stuff and we like gave it i mean i wasn't a big part of this it was other people in the residency that did an awesome job but they're like hey here's what's going on we get called in 70 of the time it's a real pain in the ass we're not seeing these patients anyway and the leadership was like cool like it's basically like a week of vacation don't i mean you can't leave it's not vacation but you guys don't have to do any other duties if you don't want to you can be excused from all of your other clinical work so that wouldn't have happened if you don't go talk to management about your concerns the key thing is like is management like listening to you or not do they care about you or not it doesn't mean that they have to do what you have to say because management may have a thousand different things to consider that you are not aware of right so like they can't just make policies to make you happy because they're like other things involved right and so this is where the the individual employees start to like this is what's challenging is that like they may not understand that right like you just see things from your perspective you don't understand like what the other needs that are pulling on management are but this is where in terms of like behavioral integration you know if you get fired from a job it's like what are the lessons that are correct to learn because not all the lessons that your mind learns are going to be correct so from the the and this is what happens when you incorrectly process stuff right so if i like if i'm dating someone they cheat on me and the lesson that i learn is never date again like that's an appropriate lesson it's like a logical lesson but it's not like the correct lesson it's it's not the lesson that you learn from like processing so oftentimes our behaviors will get adjusted in a drastic and sort of like very like black and white way like don't ever talk to management don't ever date again don't ever drive again right those are the things that until we correctly process we start to like swing the pendulum in the other direction and so proper processing is about thinking okay like what did i do right right and what did i do wrong and what can i do better and then also like what should i continue doing and i don't know if this makes sense but all of these things are going to be influenced by your identity by your emotional state so if we talk about what is emotional like how do you process an event right whether it's your first kiss or like getting fired it's gonna involve all these steps like let's run through the first kiss example so had my first kiss emotionally i'm over the moon oh my god i'm loved she loves me he loves me whatever i've become a chad i've left i've left the the the realm of the betas and i've entered in the chat mode behavior hey when can we meet up 15 minutes later hey when can we meet up hey when can we meet up hey i've been thinking about you all the time i've been thinking about you all the time i can't stop thinking about you i can't stop thinking about you why aren't you texting me back why aren't you texting me back why aren't you texting me back did i do something wrong what's going on did i screw up was i not a good kiss am i not a good kisser right so even like a positive thing if not processed correctly if you don't consider how it affects your identity if you don't consider how it affects your behaviors will end up problematic so the three fundamental steps of processing are first of all understand the emotions secondly how those emotions are going to influence your view of yourself whether in the confident realm or the non-confident realm right and then ultimately that your emotions and your sense of identity changing are going to shape your behaviors and that's where you've got to be really careful because there may be things that you need to be doing better but there may be things that you actually don't want to change right because now if you if the lesson you take away from this experience is don't ever talk to your managers and you have a nice manager at a job and you have a problem what you're doing is shooting yourself in the foot you're handicapping yourself on delivering feedback what you need to do is get better at delivering feedback by all means but i would argue that like if you're at a place where you cannot talk to your manager that's not a good place that to stay right it doesn't mean that they have to acquiesce to what you're saying all the time it's just like you know like there are two sides to every story and if your manager says hey by the way the reason you got fired is because we were paying you to do this job and instead of doing this job you were doing you were looking for another job like you can look for another job in your free time right and that's where like the ego really comes in you got to be super careful here because the ego will say oh they didn't they fired me because i was looking for another job no we didn't fire you because you were looking for a job we fired you because you were looking for a job on company time when we were paying you to do something else right like and maybe they fired you because you were looking for another job but that's doesn't make sense and right like i mean maybe it does i don't know but like so this is where you got to be super careful especially about that identity or ego piece and ultimately processing is sort of like moving forward and integrating all these experiences in a healthy way making like healthy adjustments and how do you know it's a healthy adjustment it's tricky right so that that's where like if you go through this process of acknowledging your emotions right that that's where like this is where the tricky thing comes in because people say okay but how do i know it's healthy and it's like that starts up here because once you're of calm mind and once you understand your identity you'll know which behaviors are healthy the whole point is that you can't tell the difference between a healthy and an unhealthy adaptation until you do this prerequisite work right this is an example of an unhealthy adaptation because when was this written like higher up in the like paragraph i guarantee and i can't guarantee you but i would say strongly that as this person continues to type these things out if they were to like respond to this and like tell like if i were to ask them how do you feel about things now what are you thinking now that some of these sentiments at the top of the like paragraph would change right that's what emotional processing is you start to develop detachment you start to develop objectivity you're no longer thinking with your emotions you can acknowledge your emotions you want to acknowledge the influence of your emotions you may even want to listen to your emotions but they're not controlling you it's you listening to them emotions shouldn't be ignored they should be integrated into your behaviors right they're useful source of information and that's what emotional processing is not just emotional processing processing and experience rather questions it's not facts over feelings okay this is important it's facts plus feelings right because like just think this is the stupid thing about facts over feelings what is a fact right like this is where like facts like so a lot of times what people who say facts over feelings don't acknowledge that there is a step of interpretation of facts right like sure like fact is truth but then that's not usually what we're actually talking about there's usually some kind of interpretation like 90 of the time there's some kind of interpretation and so like you have to acknowledge that interpretation because it's just like so i had a statistics professor once told me that you know statistics don't lie right because they're facts but statistics are like a bikini what they reveal is enticing but what they conceal is vital so just because it's a statistical fact does not mean it is truth right there's an interpretation i'll give you guys just a simple example in order to get into medical school in the united states if you are asian or south asian you have to have higher scores than people of other ethnicities does that mean that asians or south asians are smarter than other people no some people may interpret it that way some people may look at like gpas of asians and south asians and say oh look their gpas are higher therefore they are smarter no that's incorrect the gpa being higher may be a fact but the interpretation is very important this is where like if you guys will listen to the parenting lecture why do you think we're better at math we're not like it's not like biologically we're better at math or maybe we are i've never seen evidence to that effect it's because when we're growing up it's like my parents are like they're making me do like multiplication tables at dinner time instead of like learning how to draw right it's because culturally we emphasize a certain thing there's the other thing about some of these like you know racial interpretations is like it's not like if you go to india everyone's indian right so that that difference doesn't exist there there are all kinds of socioeconomic status immigrant status all kinds of diaspora effects for some of these things but the fact is the fact but there's always an interpretation right like the overwhelming evidence is that like people who make conclusions about this kind of stuff are there's there's a conclusion that's it's not facts over feelings it's facts plus feelings you know and this is the other thing is that you may not like us give you to talk about the same example again so back when i was a kid and i would like you know be walking by my parents friends and they would ask me who do you like more your mom or your dad if you guys remember that example right i'm looking at that seems like an innocent question they're like the fact is that they're asking about a preference that i have right that's the fact but my feeling when everyone's looking at me and grinning is like an important piece of information this is some kind of test i'm on trial they're looking for something right so motions are our brain's way of giving us like information incredibly quickly because cognitive processing and analytical thinking or slow it's type 2 reasoning daniel kahneman you guys want a book recommendation go read thinking fast and slow so our brain has realized oh by the way we have this like awesome thing called the limbic system which can give you instant answers and can like give you like pretty good indications of what you should be doing there's shortcomings to it right because it's like quick and dirty but it works you know so it's not facts over feelings it's facts plus feelings that's really the right way to like approach things other questions thinking fast and slow is a hard greed you're damn right it is it's a slog does this relate to manipura chakra meditation absolutely well done king krish live so manipura chakra meditation is something that i will use for emotional processing right but there's no science behind that that's just personal experience and clinical experience that's what i mean okay so someone's asking um how to process what i can't pinpoint when i meditate i often feel sad but i just can't figure out what it is so that's the process right so like you're not at the point of fixing something yet you're still at the diagnostic phase so this is where i'd say continue to meditate like sit down and journal right like you'll be surprised at what comes up once you open the doors right like so open the doors to your mind and like see what comes out so like you can start by asking like what's making me sad right what am i sad about how do i know if what comes out is right or wrong what comes out is not right or wrong right or wrong is a judgment what comes out is an observation do you all understand the difference right so whatever comes out comes out like that's just an observation it's in your mind whether it's correct or incorrect is like not important yet first it's just what what's there so if something is making me sad let's say someone is asking how do i get out of the bad kisser mindset if you have this mindset like even if it's wrong it's completely irrelevant right at this point it just is so you can say it's wrong if i say like i'm lazy and i shouldn't do this how does that affect my life not one iota the judgment of things is good and bad is not where the work is done okay you all get that like this is the biggest problem is we're so quick to judge and so so slow to understand because the mind loves judging easy to judge easy to criticize right so one of the biggest problems nowadays like we see this a lot on the internet is like it's very easy to criticize someone but it's like very hard to like understand them because criticism is easy your mind jumps to judgments oh this place sucks this place has bad fries this this country is a crap hole you know these people are idiots right like it's easy to like it's so easy to criticize so difficult to understand and there's a big dunning-kruger effect here too where like the more like you'll see this if you really pay attention is is you know the less knowledgeable people are the more likely they are to criticize like if you go play a game of dota or lol or valorant or whatever you go to low mmr and you're a good mmr player i guarantee you people will tell you what you're doing wrong right and get a lot of people have no idea what they're talking about that are quick to criticize and that's just the nature of the mind it's easy to judge so start by understanding what you want first is observations and once you observe once you like start to really like open yourself up a little bit and just observe then you can start to understand and once you start to understand then your judgment making capacity will be far far improved and that's why in our in our model it's like emotional understanding comes first identity understanding comes first behavioral change comes last right and this is the big problem is that everyone is trying to shortcut to change everyone's trying to say like okay how do i fix this and it's like it's gonna be hard that's why just do it doesn't work why doesn't just do it work it's because you can't jump straight to behavior you have to go through the prerequisite psychological steps you
