right you don't know am i doing enough or not so how do you know how do you answer the question of am i doing enough on social media i don't know you ask other people so that you understand what the average is hello oh hey that scared me oh sorry what do you go by friend uh sure okay and pierre what um uh i think our prompt today is where do you want to go and what's getting in the way yep that's exactly that or sorry who do you want to be but what keeps you from getting there yep so tell me pierre can you hear me or not yes i can hear you okay cool um i got a disclaimer to do okay now just so so we're on the same on the same page my english is not my first language so i'm gonna try my best okay awesome thank you there you go um where do i start um i think i'm just gonna read again what i've wrote on the scott chat okay so what i said is my whole life i wanted to be a comic artist webbed an artist basically telling my own stories to the whole world but now i'm currently working on my dream project and trying to make a living out of it after dumping my girlfriend sacrificing my social life working all the damn time and cutting all income i kind of feel like i'm a prisoner of my own passion i don't know if i'm ready to sacrifice my unhappiness in the name of my future self the successful storyteller i have striven to become or just let go in order to become someone else not bound to my work but free to live pretty much it wow man that's deep okay so pierre you are a rarity my friend oh how is that why because most people dream of giving up their careers their lives they want to give in to their passion right they want to sacrifice everything like in the movies like i'm an artist and i'll sacrifice everything for the sake of my art that's exactly that that's what everyone wants to everyone's too afraid to do it yep and so tell me tell me about your sacrifices my friend how'd you make them how how did you make those decisions i think foreign yeah just i think the biggest sacrifice i went through was especially in my dating life i've been in a long streak since 2016. i've been through a lot of girlfriends got a lot of relationships and now it's just like a void and it's not it's not familiar it's kind of an expression of something different and what are the words for that i have no clue that's why i'm here and the obvious sacrifices are like i said is dating life financial that's the right word social life i don't see my friends that often the only moment i can just interact with them is with a friend i would go to the gym with them and because i force myself and force myself it's a pleasure to do it's like i like to do it but it's i force myself to go outside and go to the gym just to you know work on myself a little bit and it's it kind of it's going to sound a bit familiar with your previous um previous person your you were chatting with is that there's a lot of notion of feeling behind like i'm surrounded by people that amazing artists that are having their life together they've got money a lot of money and they're just doing amazing things in here in the industry concept artists illustrators and and i'm 26 years old still struggling on my thing it's taking a long time to do it and there is no certainty it's going to work at all and it's scary it's so scary because if it fails it's like i've it's like i've i've used all my cards basically okay when you say you've you're surrounded by people who are successful how are you surrounded by them what's the nature of your interaction surrounded is um i've i'm close to a few friends uh they got back to back to my art school and they've through circumstances i've met other people through discord channel and this discord channel is private by the way so and these people i finally met them in your person and these people are enjoyable amazing and to say they are friends it's a kind of a stretch but there's these are people like i can share professionally but that's pretty much it okay but the other friends i have with the other friends i have are coming from the my art school and but what and when you say these people are very successful like how do you know like are they are they making a living making art oh yeah yeah sure yeah yeah to be fair like if i should compare to most of freelance artists like they are making money like i'm pretty sure that like are they like making millions no no at all but very successful and doing like kind of decent bucks in the industry that's that's cool especially when you're freelance and i think it's it stems from basically the thing i'm comparing myself a lot i got no money and no like no salary or income at the moment and so uh i'm not what do you do you think that if you keep at it you will i'm just not too familiar with your industry so like what you know what are the chances that you can sustain yourself financially i'm taking a direction that is very different from them from a lot of people i know like i think it's gonna be easier for you to understand my struggle by just saying that what i'm doing is i'm it's not bragging or anything but i know it's unique okay it's not it's like everyone is working for a client they're doing influenced freelance jobs or they working in a studio or people are just working for you know some some friends i have or in the comic industry even traditional comic industry which is like you print comic books and you sell them worldwide and i'm trying to do webtoons and webtoons are just basically comics on phone and you just scroll them and you got a story and i i've been working on this idea of this project i got in my mind and just whole thing of wing webtoons and i'm tr and i feel like i've got something to bring but i don't know if this thing i want to bring is going to to be accepted okay and how many hours a week do you spend on your project from monday to sunday and basically eight to nine hours a day and uh so are you like like is there like a completion point or you're like uploading stuff regularly like what's what's what's what's getting in the way of success my i'm sorry it's confusing um [Music] the you're explaining things very well it's this is just my ignorance of your industry okay fair enough um i think i'm gonna speak for myself what i'm doing at the moment and why i'm so scared it's basically at the moment um comics takes comic takes a long time to do like a very long time and i'm trying to plan ahead like to give you an example i'm trying to work on this thing and i'm trying to plan like in a year basically i know exactly how many things i'm going to do how many chapters i'm going to do in like in the next next august 2023 basically i know how many things i'm gonna do i know how many things i'm gonna draw i know that all my weekends are gonna be like full of work i know that that day and that i'm going to rest okay so so uh i thanks for explaining that peter i'm still not i'm going to ask my question again sorry for interrupting yeah what is keeping you from being successful is this the kind of thing where your comics aren't out yet or they're out and you're they're not getting better at the moment at the moment it's it's not out and then when it's not out so um um there are a few three chapters that i've done for a contest for those who i'm webtoon there probably know there's been this contest called call to action and i published my three chapters there and you can't publish uh on the thing like up until october so i'm i'm currently working on the storyboard which is like kind of of a rough of a future chapters you're going to do yep and and that will help me to work on them in the future so now we're going to publish them um let me say that weekly so pierre here's what i'm kind of trying to understand is like let's say you continued giving this your all and making sacrifices do you have a sense of like when you would at least have an initial like product where you like where when's the first opportunity for you to be quote unquote successful let's put it that way uh to make a living out of it you know i know but like when is that like so let's say like i'm an author right yeah yeah and i can say okay i'm writing a book but like the the book yeah like when is the earliest opportunity that i could have to publish that book for it to hit shelves for people to start reading it i'm trying to understand like where you are practically like what are we talking about here so at the moment to say it like all right in a funny way would be like i'm i'm a mono i'm a moment i'm nothing i'm no one at the moment i i get that you're no one at the moment what i'm saying is when is the first chance for you to be a someone yeah so the thing is webtoon are publishers as well and what i'm striving for is to you know make the editors on webtoon to notice me and get a contract from them or being be successful enough and get viewed a novel platform to have enough patrons to have to sustain myself in the future okay so but basically yeah so like what is the timeline for like so but can anyone support you on patreon or something right now you don't have comics that are up right now right at the moment there are only three chapters i'm doing a psych project which is like a tiny thing i'm doing at the moment and at the moment to be realistic at the moment i know that it's going to take a lot of time it's going to take a long long time but how long it's going to be because the thing is i've i've set up some kind of deadline until august 2023 okay exactly so still better so here's here's can i offer some thoughts pierre yeah okay tell me so i've worked with a fair number of artists i've worked with artists who are both successful and unsuccessful so here's what i've noticed so sometimes what holds an artist back is the quality of their craft so for example like if i'm an author like my book just isn't good enough and so sometimes like what i need to invest in is is like becoming a better writer now that's kind of like a long-term investment we don't really ever know if i'm gonna get there or not get there yeah other artists i've worked at they much like yourself feel like they've got a really good idea have something unique or willing to put in the effort i'm gonna assume for a moment that you have the skill to accomplish what you need to but what i often times find is that a lot of artists are so focused on the art that they sort of don't think about the practicalities or it's not they don't think about it it's that they don't devote a lot of energy to exploring the practicalities so i can write a really good book but like if i want to make it there's a difference between writing a good book and being a successful author and it's in that gap that i think a lot of people fall short so i can't i have no idea how to judge whether your art has merit or not merit or things like that let's assume for a moment that if disseminated properly your webtoons will be successful even if your webtoons are good enough to be successful there are a lot of steps here which i'm not hearing a whole lot of clarity on right so like this is the kind of thing where if you're trying to decide okay what am i going to do i'm making all these sacrifices because like basically what you're talking about is almost like not really being an artist it's almost more like being an entrepreneur especially our content creator especially in today's day and age where for example like you know some people who are successful at making web comics are very good at a lot of things besides making web comics so for example you'll see you know social media posts about particular web um you know they'll have uh they'll put up like a good patreon page things like that so there's a lot of stuff here that i think if you you're what i'm basically kind of hearing you say is like i don't know if i should continue doing this or not doing it is that fair to say um can i just say something yeah you are seem pretty aware of what the industry is is by everything you said like you seem to be pretty knowledgeable about what's going on so just wanted to say that i mean i i don't know about webtoons but like i said i've worked with a lot of artists and that because i just don't know like if you were talking about writing a book that's a process i'm way more familiar with but my point is that becoming so because you talk you're talking about money right so there's like a difference between like being an artist and paying your bills as an artist and my point is that paying your bills as an artist as we look at many artists who died penniless right who now we revere their works of art there's like this like simple thing where it's like you know being able to pay your bills is more about some of this other stuff and what i'm hearing from you there may be issues of confidence or or this or that or losing yourself or things like that but like my biggest concern is that you're grinding eight to nine hours a day seven days a week but i'm not hearing like much of a business plan like i don't know like okay so you join this contest that sounds good like that's the kind of concrete stuff that i'm kind of thinking about and that's where i think like you know if i i mean i don't know that we're gonna we're not gonna have time to do this because when i've worked with artists it's been longitudinally and stuff like that but usually it's sort of like sitting down and sort of thinking about okay so you've given yourself august of 2023 that sounds like a fantastic end point but i think the key thing to remember there is whether august of 2023 is successful or a failure is going to depend on what you do in that time which can be more than storyboarding and working on your art right like what's the end point so it in business for example there's this phrase called kpi which is key performance indicator and my biggest concern for you is that i don't know how to measure whether you're on the right track or not yeah and i think like aside business things it just i think it stems from the the fear of not doing enough i guess because i know i'm i'm working a lot in all the communication i think it's just my my biggest flaw i just i'm not communicating enough on my project i'm just doing a few stories on instagram and posting a few stuff there and there once it's done but i'm not taking the time to just to talk about it because i feel like hey man maybe you should work on this thing hey it's not done enough work and work at work again and i'm not taking the time to just talk about it talk about it you mean like social media wise yeah yeah so i i know this sounds kind of weird pierre because i i'm not sure if you were like looking for more of like an internal exploration but honestly what i'm hearing from you is like more nuts like i i think that i don't know how to say this but like no amount of internal exploration is going to be a substitute for playing the game of the industry yeah and what i'm hearing is that you actually seem very introspective you seem very devoted to your art you seem like you feel very confident in an idea that you've got and so what worries me more about you is not any of that stuff because you like i said like most people are are struggling to make the the leap right like we started this off by saying you're really different from most people because most people play it safe and they're never able to make the leaf and commit to their art since you've already given everything up what concerns me the most is now that you've jumped off the cliff how do we help you land the best does that make sense yeah i start it starts to make sense yeah and so this is where i'd start like you know my first thought is like you have access to this discord server i don't know if people on the discord server if you've talked to them about how they've become successful and financially stable have you talked to them about huh no i don't know yeah so i think you need to like use these opportunities to like try to figure out how an artist becomes financially stable so like and this is what i see with artists is that you'll devote yourself to your craft but you can write the best like as we've seen from artists in the past they'll die penniless because they don't know anything about like marketing or selling right and that's the real challenge of being an artist is that everyone makes it seem like it's this creative pursuit but the truth of the matter is if you're talking about art for the sake of paying your bills then you've got to be a little bit more like entrepreneurial so i would start by asking people on your discord server hey like so this is my situation i'm kind of curious how do you make ends meet do you feel like there's a how do you balance like artistic development versus like taking freelance gigs because the other kind of thing that i'm kind of wondering pierre is on a very very basic level if this is a long-term project where it's going to take two or three years of like storyboarding and revising and stuff like that and you can't sustain yourself financially then like it may be a better decision because i've been in situations i've worked with people who are like this where even to a certain degree been in this situation myself where like i can't afford to make art for three years without paying bills so i'm gonna get a job and sustain myself and it's gonna take me five years instead of three but that's actually like the better plan yeah and what i'm really hearing from you is is that you've got to figure this out like more practically like let's just assume that your art is going to be successful if you play your cards right yeah so it it goes like a conversation of business conversation and like all business tips and stuff well i mean not i'm i'm sorry if it it's not you know the typical conversation no i mean it doesn't bother me i love having this conversation i think it's a conversation we actually don't have enough in this community because i think you rp are someone who's like you've overcome your expectations and overcome you know like money and like you've you've like taken the plunge and so now the issue is for people who've taken the plunge like how do we understand okay like who or who would potentially buy your comic who would pay for your webtoon who are the communities that would like support you on patreon right even if you're offering something unique there may be a particular audience how do you get in front of those communities you know how do you know like let's say you take it to an editor and an editor says okay we're not going to buy this at this time how do you know what you need to change for that person to say yes like these are the kinds of things that i'm not really hearing from you which i'm afraid the only reason that bothers me is because you're trying to pay your i don't know bills my bills is not it's not an issue like i i forgot to give a little bit of context says i'm currently living in my in my parents house at the moment so i got food i got the yeah yeah so so i i i sort of got that right so i didn't ask you how you're sustaining yourself because you're saying i'm not making any money so i i i put two or two together there but my point is that even by august 2023 like my worry is that you'll spend seven days a week nine hours a day making art storyboarding making art storyboarding but you're so disconnected from your audience that after that year you show up with something and it's like not what people are looking for or you haven't built enough like social media stuff over time or like whatever because i've even i've i've even like i don't know if you've heard of um uh this guy named have you ever heard of a guy named brandon sanderson yep so brandon sanderson actually had a podcast i think he still got it but the podcast was basically with three people and one of the people is a webcomic person and so he talks a lot about like they talk about like how to be successful as a wed webcomic artist and what it takes and stuff like that so i'm getting the sense that you know from an art standpoint you seem solid it's just like how do we how do you think through things so that you know how to present your art i got a question do you think i'm self sabotaging here because i got a feeling i am what i'm aware of i'm aware of everything you said here but i feel like there's a part of me which is trying to you know not do this job and just to focus on the art i'm doing as some kind of escape of responsibilities i have and a success but i don't know if i want like if that's something i have built for many many years but it's like i'm so close to it but i'm not putting all the tools there to have it and i know i have to do it but i don't do it i'm just doing art doing my thing on this side do i think you're self-sabotaging i mean if you if you're asking the question maybe but here's here's what i'd say yeah i know a lot of artists who really like making art and i know a lot of artists who don't like anything except for making art and here's the thing to understand about success so a lot of times people think that success is being really really really good at one thing but in my experience being successful is being really really good at one thing or even decent at one thing but it also requires a minimum competence in a bunch of other stuff that you may not like doing and the artists that i've worked with who are more successful like objectively i'm not talking about the quality of their art i mean can pay their bills people know who they are the reach of their audience are the ones who focused you know they still primarily focus on their art but they don't ignore the other stuff so is this is there something psychological going on sure but i think the real question is like if you know you need to do this stuff like i'm not so sure that it's psychological honestly it sounds to me a little bit more operational which means that you're you've just never done this before so your brain literally doesn't know the steps yeah like if i is scaring me yeah so then that's normal that's just because it's like if i tell you pierre you know you say you've you've had several girlfriends before but if you'd never dated anyone and i'm like go get a girlfriend it's going to be like scary to people right because they've never done it before so this is where i mean is it self-sabotage i don't think so i don't get the sense that this is like a deep psychological like you know i mean i have no idea if we spent a lot of time together maybe it would be the case but i don't get the sense that you're like like trying to shoot your success in the foot i think the problem is that you've figured out that you're good at one thing there's one thing that excites you you can grind towards one thing and there's a lot of stuff that you don't really like know to how to even start with that like so you don't know how to start so you don't know how to do it what do you think about that i'm thinking no i think it's just the main fear i have you may fear it's not fear it's just something i'm not used to is just when i'm seeing all these people are selling themselves on social media they seem false this is not not real and that's something i cannot do even if we force me to do it it's something i cannot do because the most the people that are mostly successful by selling art and doing stuff are people on social media speaking of it on social media are people that are playing a game of trends and things that i'm not good at at all and even if i force myself to do it i can't i really can't so i think you've got to be careful there because you're assuming that first of all people on social media are fake and secondly that you have to be fake to succeed on social media i i think that a lot of people on social media are fake but i think that people the audience of social media is tired of fake people on social media and there's actually a hunger for authenticity and i i would say you know if you're if we want to talk about self-sabotage if you're concluding in your mind that i have to be fake to be successful i'm not saying that being faker will make you more successful but i i think that there's like i mean even the story that you're sharing today i think a lot of people would resonate with yeah and that's what you know i would love to hear people like that yeah so that that's good so that's why i think like what what what i would kind of do is like you know i mean you got to be careful because i don't really know your situation but i would start by talking to people on your discord and just ask them hey do you have some time to talk i'd love to learn about like your creative process how do you manage like art versus like you know creating art versus paying bills free links to gigs versus not freelance gigs how many hours a week do you work how do you storyboard you know how much time do you spend how how long did it take you from the first idea to like getting your first finished webcomic for whatever website you want editors to pay you for i would also approach them hey i have these three chapters they're in this competition is this something that y'all would be interested in what are y'all looking for right now right so like asking some of those questions and that's where you may say like oh my god it's my art i never want to compromise an inch of it which is totally fine but what you may find and this has been my experience as a content creator is that like my range is actually pretty wide and i'm actually okay adapting a little bit to what people are looking for just to give you an example when i started streaming before my first stream i spent three months indexing like 150 scientific papers because i was convinced that when i show up on twitch everyone is super skeptical and everyone's gonna want references and citations and sources and what i was really surprised by is like i didn't get any questions about science i got tons of questions about spirituality and like even though i had this idea of what i wanted to share which is i wanted to teach people about mental health it turned like more into a spiritual kind of thing and like i was actually okay making that adaptation and there may be adaptations that you're actually okay making but my point is that right i think your biggest problem honestly pierre is that your it sounds like you're working in a studio for like 70 hours a week without like talking to anyone yeah that's that's kind of a thing and so i think if you want to be successful that's not about the quality of your art that's about communication between your art and the rest of the world it takes time right sure which is why if you've got till august 2023 i think that's fantastic but i think the earlier you get started the better and i'm not saying make any commitments i'm just saying start having conversations so you understand what is out there and like what it's going to take it's it's it's bizarre because everything you say i'm quite aware of all this stuff i made i made this conscious choice to work tirelessly on this thing because it takes so much so much time like it's i know that i have to communicate on all the stuff i know that i have to share my my story out there i know that i've know some do some because i'm already doing it in a way on instagram i'm just sharing stuff there i'm posting there i'm trying to find solutions to change how i post them it's just i don't feel like i'm doing enough and if i'm trying to do more will be okay like do i do i have to change something the way i express myself is it is it good or not it's just pierre so i'm hearing you're asking do i need to be doing more am i doing enough and my point is that i don't i don't think your problem is one of what's the right move i think your problem is not one of treatment it's one of diagnosis i think your problem is that you don't know how to answer those questions yet right you don't know am i doing enough or not so how do you know how do you answer the question of am i doing enough on social media i don't know you ask other people so that you understand what the average is so i i think you need more information from other people in your industry which may be a very unsatisfying answer i don't i mean because oftentimes it's like you know like oh like tell me about your upbringing and stuff like that but honestly this is the kind of thing where like a bro honestly i want to see you succeed but i think whether you succeed or not doesn't i mean there may be a certain amount of like internal stuff like why is it hard for you to have these conversations like there may be some kind of shame or like you feel embarrassed to ask or like there may be some internal stuff but what i'm saying is like very practically you've got to figure out like what's your business model for success as an artist no i to be to be fair like the fact that you're just telling me that it's just practical stuff it's just reassuring that means that i'm okay yeah i'm doing fine hey then if i if i should shift the conversation elsewhere it's what am i going to do in august 2023 if it fails and this thing scares me so much so so much because i have no clue what to do no clue it's like this thing i've been carrying for so so so long i've been worried it's not bragging or anything i hate to say this but it's just i've been working on this thing for so so long and i know there's this thing in my mind going like hey man you've been working on this thing for so long you deserve success you deserve this but another part of me is saying hey man the word doesn't work like that they don't care about you so here's what i so this is gonna sound kind of weird too so i've got two kind of answers to that the one one is that you you may have to deal with a certain amount of that now but i think trying to solve that problem of 2023 now is a waste of your time and what i mean by that is that so like because what happens in 2023 depends on i don't i know this is gonna sound weird but what happens in 2023 depends on what happens in 2023. so when august of 2023 rolls around what do you do well that depends like maybe in august of 2023 you've got a patreon page with four subscribers and maybe in august of 2023 you've got zero subscribers maybe in august of 23 2023 you've got a hundred patriot patrons maybe in august of 2023 the editor says hey i really think that you're on to something but we're looking for something that's more appealing to this group and so what i'm saying is like it's it's like there's no point in figuring out what you're going to do after 2023 because your position in 2023 could be in a like 10 different places yeah it's left to randomness right right so so and i think that's why it's like kind of like you know once again in medicine it's sort of like well what if the test comes back positive well like let's see what the test shows because with the results of the test inform the next steps and so the only tricky thing there is that you're gonna have to move forward with some amount of like fear and uncertainty just hanging out with you i'm not saying it's easy to do that right like because that that worry is going to be in your head and you've you've got to live with that yeah i'm working with it every morning but yeah i mean so that's challenging and so meditate and all that other good stuff but i think at the end of the day like we can't figure out what to do in august of 2023 because like who knows like maybe you'll win this context contest and then 14 editors will be like we want your webtoon and then you'll become you really created something unique and the internet absolutely loved it and then suddenly like you've got a merch store and people are ordering prints and like who the hell knows what's going to happen in august 2023. in august of 2019 like no one predicted kovid so i'd say like focus on what you've got to do this week the next week the week after that i'd be really careful about not being too zoomed in on just making your artwork and recognize that some things don't take a lot of work but it takes time to grow right so like there's a difference between building something and like growing something and i wouldn't wait until you know july of august 2023 to plant the seed of social media oh no no i would be doing like i'll be working on social media like i would be sharing stuff by saying hey it's going to add yeah so all of its i think some going on there chapters on you can read it there they are there but it's not going out to be like all all social media like doing reals and it's just going to be pretty basic but because i don't have time to do more just yeah that's okay but so that that's where like i i think you're trying to solve a lot of problems without the appropriate information pierre that's like kind of the beginning of end of what i'm hearing like that's the most important thing so i talk to these people on this discord and try to figure out like how this works whatever website you're trying to get to try to do that even uh you know whatever call to action like that all sounds like good stuff you just got to figure this stuff out and that is like you can't you can try to figure out on your own but the whole point is that you're in this private discord server that is invite only with successful artists so you've got a lot of information at your fingertips and you'd be amazed at how much you can learn by just asking people okay sure thanks for calling in man i'm doing i'm doing good i guess i wasn't expecting to have this conversation i i thought i was going to have like oh man maybe you should change your career or maybe you're not doing the good choice or something like that but no it's just no apparently the thing that not most people are doing yeah so i mean to to summarize pierre i think it's not my place to say that you should change your career it was a mistake or not a mistake sure sure yeah what i'm hearing is that you've taken the plunge and you've made a lot of sacrifices so my primary concern is now like how can we make sure that those sacrifices are as worth it as we can make it yeah yeah good luck to you my friend yeah good luck to you to you too thank you take care you too bye okay so quick summary so that's kind of interesting so first of all it's cool to have you know artists in our community um i think it is interesting because sometimes the challenge that we have is like how do i take the plunge how do i quit my dead end job how do i make these sacrifices and we almost like fantasize that if i make all these sacrifices and i devote myself to my craft then i will be successful but the truth of the matter is like making the sacrifices is a really important but also insufficient step then there's a lot of other stuff that you have to do which is more than the madness of the creation creative process in your studio and sometimes like this is what i've seen with a lot of artists is like really the ones who are successful versus the ones who are less successful we're talking about like fame money like those are the barometers of success i'm not commenting on the quality of their art i don't know how to judge that it's actually the ones who spend um have a minimum amount of competence in a lot of these other dimensions social media relationships networking even to certain degree like discipline and taking care of themselves and waking up on time and going to bed on time and things like that like that's the stuff that you really have to do i mean like so for example you can be the most brilliant doctor in the world at least in the united states but unless you are up to date with your documentation and your cme and a bunch of other administrative crap like you're not going to make it as a doctor because being a doctor is not just about practicing medicine it's about all of the administrative stuff that comes with practicing medicine and that's true of like any profession right there's like the actual work of the profession and there's all the stuff that you do on the side so that you can do the work of the profession and oftentimes artists because it's so much about craft and passion and vision and creating something unique that like we kind of lose sight of that other stuff and oftentimes it's the stuff that you don't enjoy doing you haven't done don't know how to do it's like business kind of stuff but i've really just noticed a big difference between artists who are aware of that stuff and artists who aren't case in point you know brandon sanderson has a podcast about all of this other stuff and look at where he is you
