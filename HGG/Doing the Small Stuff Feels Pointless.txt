so it doesn't matter whether money is real or not like the act of gambling and the random reinforcement schedule and getting some kind of victory is sufficient in suppressing the limbic system i need everything to feel worthwhile whenever i'm doing well anything really healthy or unhealthy i have this issue where i need everything to feel completely and totally worthwhile as of late i felt it becoming increasingly problematic for b for being both productive and healthy essentially i set out with a goal of some kind and if i don't complete them i either waste absurd amounts of time trying to complete those goals or have a heavy damper on my mood for the rest of the day which stops me from getting anything done there are some situations that i think are worse than others trying to meet people for example has been coming up a lot since i'm just starting college on days where i haven't met as many people as i liked or had a good conversation with anyone i end up in a very drained state where i could can't get a lot of schoolwork done i feel like i just want to go home and sit around for a day playing video games or doing something generally easy usually by the next day i feel fresher however there are times where i feel like this need for things to be worthwhile has been borderline addictive most recently i've been spending hours staying up playing this gambling this gambling on a game i play to earn credits it's not real money and there's zero benefit to having the currency aside from saying that you have a lot still i keep playing when i lose a bit i feel a need to earn my way back up and end up driving myself further into holes i get that gambling can be like that but i find it odd that i'm so hooked even though the money has zero value i've also recognized as a problem with porn usage which is a problem i've been actively trying to deal with whenever i relapse though i get into this mindset of i won't be doing this for a while again and binge really hard until i feel satisfied i was wondering does anyone else feel this way how do i have this need for productivity affect me less harmfully is this a health healthy mindset in any capacity so let's kind of take a quick look at this so this is a situation where someone needs to feel like everything they do is worthwhile so oftentimes you've got a particular thing that you want to accomplish and you want to you know you want to use your time productively so we want to use our time productively because then we're like good people we're healthy people we're successful people if we use our time productively so let's be productive everything's got to be i can't waste any time and then what happens is if everything we have to do needs to be productive and we can't waste time something weird starts to happen if we don't live up to some of our expectations we'll either waste a lot of time trying to accomplish these goals because we gotta do it right or we'll have a heavy damper on my mood for the rest of the day and then what happens is we'll oftentimes get into these situations where we're not quite sure what's going on and then we fall into all these other kinds of behaviors like playing video games doing gambling stuff pornography so let's try to understand what's going on here okay let's try to break down first of all where does the feeling that you need to do everything worthwhile come from secondly how do we sort of manage that feeling how do we deal with it thirdly what are the consequences of this whole cycle both psychologically neurologically reinforcement wise and lastly like what do we do about it okay so let's take a look so generally speak speaking i exist and then what happens is when i go about living my life i will create an expectation so this person for example will talk about let's say you know i'm in college and so on days where i haven't met as many people as i liked or had a good conversation with someone i end up in a drained state so let's try to understand what that means so we create an expectation for ourselves and then let's say we start here and we try to live up to that expectation if we live up to that expectation fantastic but if we fall short of the expectation this window leads to disappointment now once we have this emotional disappointment what you remember is a feeling our brain oh make myself disappear for a second once we have this emotional disappointment what we're gonna do is cope with it okay so this is how the brain sort of deals with emotions we have to do coping bring myself back so let's take a look at that so once i feel emotional disappointment let's say this is shame right so like feeling like i've fallen behind look at all those other people i start making comparisons all those other people are making friends and i'm not making friends and then once i start to do that this i have to deal with these emotions with like some kind of emotional um let's make sure okay okay so i have to deal with all these negative emotions with things like video games gambling the unholy trifecta and this person even points out that even when i'm gambling there's no real money involved so why do i keep doing it i'm not really gaining anything and that's because that makes sense actually interesting because when it comes to gambling for example our brain has certain like circuits that get activated when we gamble when we activate these circuits when we gamble they actually suppress our limbic system so it doesn't matter whether the money is real or not like the act of gambling and the random reinforcement schedule and getting some kind of victory is sufficient in suppressing the limbic system so this explains why even if you're not getting any money you're still going to be gambling because it's doing the the gambling is doing the job that it is is set out to do which is to deal with all this emotional disappointment and so what i would imagine we'd see in this person is that the more they fall short of their expectations the more they engage in this sort of gambling behavior and falling behind and all this kind of stuff pornography video games etc so now we've got another issue which is that once i've fallen short this translates into the future so if i've fallen short by this this amount let's say what that means is that going forward i start at a deficit so now when tomorrow rolls around let's say here's the baseline here's what i want to accomplish here's the expectation but i'm actually starting over here so since i only made one friend yesterday i actually have to cover this whole distance so even if i move from here to here let's say i do this much how does it feel how much have i fallen short now i've fallen short by this amount right so even though i made progress it feels like i fall short and then this carries over to next time now this is below the baseline now today i have to do this and now let's say that i work extra hard right so yesterday i did this much today i'm gonna do this much socializing that's a lot more where am i now the gap is this much and so something very bizarre starts to happen if you really look at this this is progress this is progress this is progress this is progress all of these are progress so now we're in trouble because despite progress we feel like we're failing now once we feel like we're failing enter the pornography and gambling and video games now we're in a lot of trouble because when progress does not positively reinforce behavior where does that leave us that's a huge issue because even though i'm doing all the right stuff i don't feel any sense of accomplishment which in turn means that i'm not going to be reinforcing the actual behavior that's improving my life and this is how you get stuck in this trap and the bigger this grows this gets so big that eventually everything you do has to feel worthwhile i cannot waste one second of a single day because i've dug myself into such a pit that i need to be extra extra productive every moment of every day every time i go out i need to make 10 friends every time i go out i need to make 15 friends every time i study i need to get an a plus it all needs to be i've wasted so much time this gap is so big oh my god how do you make up for this gap everything has to be worthwhile because if i'm so far behind i can't afford to waste any time so this is something that's kind of interesting people who are successful can afford to waste time people who are behind cannot afford to waste time the more in the hole you are the less your time is worth the more miserly you are about it it's huge irony right so if i'm behind if i'm 28 years old and i haven't graduated from college and i don't have a job how much is my time actually worth not very much if i'm 28 years old and i'm in surgical residency how much is time my time worth it's worth objectively more who feels guiltier taking vacation the 28 year old who doesn't have a job whose time is worth objectively less than the surgeons or the surgeon who's 28 and like can't wait for a vacation and so now we get into a lot of very interesting problems the first problem that we've already talked about is that despite progress we feel like we're failing the second problem is that we become miserly with our time and as we become miserly with our time we can't take chances if we can't take chances we become paralyzed in terms of options i can't even apply to college because i need to get in so the application has to be perfect if the application has to be perfect i have to spend so much longer on it i can't afford to do good enough this leads to paralysis the more we get paralyzed the more further behind we fall and the more we end up being miserly with our time and if you can't experiment you can't take chances it's really hard to dig yourself out of the hole the last thing which we've also kind of talked about is that the fur the more that one and two pile up the more we end up with emotional coping mechanisms so we've covered this kind of gambling gaming etc and the problem is that these in turn like make it harder to actually make progress right so these then sabotage us so what do you do about this abandon expectations so this whole thing starts with this idea right here here's my starting point here's my expectation if i move this amount this is falling short if i have no expectation this is all a win we started today here we ended today here this is a win if i have an expectation this is a loss do you all get that like this is mind-blowing once you really get it that the same amount of effort or progress can lead to positive reinforcement or negative reinforcement all based on the expectations there's kind of a core to abandoning expectations you can't fix tomorrow oh sorry you can't fix yesterday's problems so let me put it to you this way if i'm 28 years old and i'm applying to college i'm thinking about applying to college and then i think to myself oh my god i don't know if i should apply to college because i don't know what to major in what if i major in the wrong thing and then i spend four years in college and then i'm 32 and i have the wrong major then i'll have wasted 14 years of my life so i can't afford to get into the wrong major i have to figure out what's the right major so then i end up doing research i never apply i'm trying to figure out okay what's the career how do i what do i do with my life i'm stuck but the key thing is that like you're 28 you've already wasted 10 years call that l like you gotta eat the l there's nothing you can do today that will make up for the time that's already passed and it's our attempt to make up for the time that's already passed that really creates the problem that's what actually paralyzes because how can i afford to lose 14 years when i've al if i if i've lost 10 but we don't think about it as losing 10 we think about it as okay if i make it worthwhile then those 10 years may not have been a waste we try to get those years back and that burden becomes so impossible because how do you make a decision for a major that makes up for 14 years of spent time impossible you set yourself up for failure so whatever you've screwed up in the past you've screwed it up it's over let it go can't fix it that hurts though oh my god like you're telling me it was a waste like i'm not telling you it's a waste you're the one who's telling me it's a waste all kinds of benefits but you refuse to see them because you're trying to make up for it so you can't solve today's the problems of yesterday today this is kind of general be careful operating from a feeling so we've got to be super careful about letting our feelings dictate our actions so i'm going to let's take a quick look at this post and understand i end up in a very drained state where i can't get a lot i feel like i just want to go home and sit around for a day playing video games next day i feel fresher right i have this issue where i need everything to feel completely and totally worthwhile how does gambling make them feel so even this i get into this mindset i won't be doing this for a while and binge really hard until i feel satisfied so what is dictating all of this person's actions when do they stop when they feel satisfied they need to feel worthwhile so i want you all to just imagine for a moment what this person's life would be like what your life would be like if feelings did not dictate your actions it's fine that you feel a particular way we're not saying that you shouldn't feel that way does the feeling need to dictate the action i need everything to feel worthwhile can you do it anyway can you even do it if it doesn't feel worthwhile what would start to happen in your life if you stopped using pornography until you felt satisfied what would happen in your life if you didn't need to feel have things feel worthwhile in order to do them i feel like i didn't make enough friends today i feel like i need to make a ton of friends at this party because i need to make up for being a shut-in for the last week what happened if what would happen if that feeling no longer controls you so you have to acknowledge that it's just a feeling we're not saying it's false but all it is is a feeling it's not a law of nature it's just how you feel in that moment and you may say okay like but dr k that's hard you're correct it is hard yogis in ancient india spent years if not decades mastering their feelings so what chance do you have pretty good one because you're basically equipped with the same stuff they are you're a human it's a very simple thing you can do if you want to know okay how do i not let my feelings engage with actions how do i not be controlled by by my feelings one very simple meditative exercise that you can do there are various versions of this so i'm going to share with you all a couple the first is that the next time when you start ordering food order it to not be perfect so let's say that i want to eat a bacon cheeseburger i'm going to order a bacon cheeseburger for lunch so instead of getting a bacon cheeseburger get either a bacon burger or a cheeseburger cut out one thing like if you if you want to get ice cream with sprinkles cut out the sprinkles in more extreme versions if you like your burgers without tomato get it with tomato either add something that you don't like or remove something that you do like from the equation and then you will say oh my god this is insane are you telling me not to eat my favorite food and you can still eat the food we're not saying deprive yourself entirely we're just saying instead of shooting for perfect satisfaction shoot for less than perfect satisfaction so what you want to start doing is allow yourself to do things that you don't feel like doing now in more extreme versions you can also do things like you know adopt more specific diets and things like that just start by not giving in to your feelings in some small way and we're not saying make it drastic right don't order your least favorite thing on the menu you like you can still order things that you like just try to make it less than perfect and as you do that what you'll start to learn is that you're gonna feel like you want that bacon i don't want tomato on the sandwich i don't want it okay well so what you can still eat it it's kind of bizarre so if you're stuck in this cycle of everything has to be worthwhile first of all understand where it comes from that it's born from expectation it's born from the things that we carry over from yesterday and put on today and fundamentally it's born from our inability to separate actions from feelings and if you can do those three things then you will be able to do things that are not worthwhile and it'll be like freeing it's like liberating to be able to do do this because right now we're so controlled by our feelings right i'm triggered or upset by people using a particular phrase so i'm i need everyone else to stop talking i'm not saying that hate speech is good or anything like that please do not interpret it that way you know there's still bad things and you know you shouldn't say things that hurt other people but at the same time like just think a little bit about right now what's happening in the world is that we're surrendering our happiness and peace of mind to the actions of others instead of training ourselves to be able to tolerate be undisturbed by someone else's venom we're actually starting to like open up and like let them affect us we're surrendering control of our own happiness to the words of other people now this is an important caveat i'm not saying it's okay to say hurtful things so we should still hold people who engage in hate speech and things like that accountable for saying harmful things but what i'm saying is that there's a there's a side to this story that we haven't engaged in which is personally being able to withstand toxicity recognizing that like this person can use whatever words they want to but i'm not going to be happy or unhappy based on what this person says like think about that for a second are we surrendering control of our peace of mind to the words of another human being i'm not saying it makes it okay i'm not saying that there shouldn't be accountability for actions that's completely different you can hold them accountable and still be internally peaceful so does that mean i don't care about what they say not caring implies apathy i don't think that you should not care about what they say i'll give you all an example so let's say someone says something hurtful to me now it can hurt to hear it right but then i've got a couple of different options i can tell them not to say this which may be completely reasonable so i'm not saying don't do that but internally i've got a couple of options too i can start to think a little bit about okay is this true do i agree with this person where is this person coming from why are they saying this is it possible they're saying it just because they've had a bad day and so sometimes when people criticize us like their criticism has a lot more to say about them than it does say about me sometimes it says a lot about me so that's where like we've got to be a little bit critical about the process but then we may sort of realize at the end of it that okay like this person is you know so i've worked with people who are addicted to substances they have histories of addiction and they'll be prescribed controlled substances so sometimes they'll be on like opioid maintenance treatment like suboxone and then they lose their suboxone and they get very very angry at me because i won't prescribe it again because they lost it who knows do they lose it did they abuse it i don't know and so there's a protocol around what's appropriate for prescribing what isn't and then depending on how they feel about it they can start getting really nasty and then i can decide how i deal with their words so do i want to hold them accountable if they say things that are disrespectful i'll tell them that the way that you're talking to the staff today is not acceptable they're here to help you and i understand that you lost your suboxone that's not their fault it's not okay to talk to people like that and also i don't have to be mad about it i don't have to be like oh my god this person is such an all addicts are bad and like oh my god no it's like that person like they've got an addiction and it sucks because they're now going to be going through withdrawal i should be compassionate and i can still hold them accountable does that make sense so it's about being like internally okay with yourself when someone says something that's harmful doesn't mean that we want to allow them to say things harmful that's like a subtlety that i think is lost on the internet that you can hold people accountable for actions while still being compassionate towards them and not letting them hurt you as best as you can and what started to happen is we've like completely forgotten that second bit right we're all about accountability and canceling people and stuff like that which there may be good reasons for i'm not saying that that there aren't good reasons to do that i'm just saying that there's another piece to it it's an incomplete equation you
