right so then what do you need you need someone else to save you because you can't save yourself because you're a child trapped in an adult's body because you should have grown up by now because you should be smarter you should be more capable you should not be so lazy you shouldn't be paralyzed to action i feel like i am a child in an adult's body i would like to begin and start that i've had a hard time debating whether or not i should make a post really glad you did if you're rich pa is out there listening to this i'm very glad you made the post i feel that my issues problems are in a way inferior compared to other people my age have we heard that before i'm 19 years old and i'm a little behind on education which wasn't my fault as the college messed up my application which leads me to being in a class with some people being three years younger than i i haven't had a job yet nor have i had really any adult experiences and this makes me feel embarrassed and ashamed if for example what i'm doing in my life right now and yes i have an anxiety disorder of some sort realistically gad self-diagnosed we'll get to that in a second my point is i fear this adult world i don't see it at i don't see almost worth living i felt suicidal for some periods and depressed and i'm not satisfied with my life i've used gaming for example to escape this reality but as the older i get the closer i feel to this impending doom however i recently learned that i have another way that i escape reality i invest into other people basically i've been dating women from time to time and i suppose not wanting to be alone i'm someone very passionate and unfortunately it's a weird way to word this but i kind of direct my passion towards the other person and invest time into them sadly this is unhealthy for me and also most likely for them too the idea of having a job scares me in general especially with my lack of skills and anything practical but not only that i don't think i would be practically beneficial to the workplace because because i have this separate kind of physical anxiety that works a bit like a panic anxiety but also pretty much subconsciously present which i don't really want to get into okay i've always wanted to feel like being saved but that someone would basically help me get stuff done this is kind of embarrassing to talk about i've always felt alone and that i have nobody to talk to about these things i'm not close to my parents people i've been close to are now busier than because life and they grew up and i haven't i lived almost the same way for a long period of time now and i feel like i need to do something about it but i feel paralyzed it's like there's always a but i'm i'm i'll gladly appreciate any advice and thank you for reading so thank you for posting there's a lot of good stuff in here okay so sometimes in life we fall a little bit behind we start to feel that we're inferior to people around us we start to feel like we kind of screwed things up and then something else can happen where we start to lose hope in the world we start to feel like maybe life isn't worth living sometimes that gets to the level of having some suicidal thoughts maybe feeling depressed and something else can happen as well which is that we start investing in other people instead of working on ourselves so what energy we do have goes towards benefiting others instead of pulling us up because when we start to invest in ourselves what tends to happen is like something gets in the way right we sort of feel like ah but i don't feel like doing this and we don't really feel capable of helping ourselves and then we even can start to fantasize that given how bad my situation is given how long i've been in this situation the only hope for salvation is to get someone to help me right because i can't do it myself so how should we understand this right because this is like a really really important post so the first thing that i want to talk a little bit about is this whole business of self-diagnosing generalized anxiety disorder panic attack suicidal ideation etc so this is the kind of thing where you know if you if you're trying to do something in life and you feel like some stuff like this is getting in the way you should absolutely go get a mental health evaluation so people are trying to figure out like so just i'll share some basics about this okay so how do you know whether someone has an illness or doesn't have an illness as a clinician how do you decide okay is this like just the emotion of anxiety or does this ride to the level of rise to the level of generalized anxiety disorder and the key thing the key hallmark of all psychiatric diagnoses is impairment to function so when it starts to affect your life when it starts to get in the way of things that's the threshold of a disorder being sad is not clinical depression even being some degree of hopeless is not clinical depression the threshold of clinical depression and that's major depressive disorder bipolar disorder schizoaffective there are all these different diagnostic criteria but the key thing that we look for is like is it actually a disorder is it disordering your life is it impairing your function and so if you're someone who's kind of stuck and you think you may have something going on and you're struggling to move forward the first thing to recognize is like get that evaluated and hopefully fixed so mental illness is no different from physical illness it's like oh i have trouble riding my bike and i'm afraid that my leg may be broken and it's like what's the first piece of advice you would give that for well like maybe you need to like not have a broken leg because that's going to fundamentally impair anything that you try to do right so if you're in this kind of situation in the strongest way possible like please go get a mental health evaluation right it's their job it's not your job to self-diagnose gad or depression or anxiety or suicidality right so if you're also having suicidal thoughts like go see a mental health professional because they're there to figure out okay you do have gad you don't have jd oh maybe you have this thing and you never even realized so i've had like patients that i've worked with that you know think they're depressed and what it turns out is they have like hypothyroidism we just start them on thyroid medication and like their problem is literally fixed as long as they take their levothyroxin their mood is perfectly normal it's because they actually have a hormonal deficiency which is measurable through a lab test so this is where the first thing you should do if you're concerned about this stuff is go see an actual like licensed professional that being said there are a couple of other things that i'd like to talk about the first is this idea of being behind right and feeling like a child so let's talk for a moment about you know what does it mean to be an adult and what does it mean to be a child and then the next thing that we want to talk a little bit about is like as we start to feel inferior and lose faith in ourselves like how does that affect our ego how does that affect the way that our mind works and why do we invest into other people and the last thing is like just generally speaking thinking about how to move forward from here from sort of a life perspective so the first thing that i want to talk about ask you all this question is what's the difference between an adult and a child how do you become an adult right so oftentimes an adult is in essence a legal designation right so we say for example in the united states that when you're 17 years old and you've been set on this earth for 17 years and 364 days you are a child you are a minor and when you've been on this earth for 17 years and 365 days you become an adult what do y'all think about that right so at least in the u.s like even being an adult is like sort of a weird fluid thing can you join the army at 18 yes can you buy a bottle of beer no right so we even delay some of the aspects of adulthood till 21. even in the united states for example i think you can be on your parents health insurance so as a child you can be on your parents health insurance until like the age of 26 or something i don't know the exact number so when it comes to like the faculties of adulthood like 18 years old 18 year olds like maybe they need to start filing i don't think you even necessarily need to file taxes maybe i don't i don't know the details on that but if we really think about all the faculties of an adult like they don't magically it's not like if you're 19 you're like sure you may be like legally designated as an adult but biologically you know you're not that different from a 18 year old or 17 year old this is where we talk about i've seen some people sort of mention this so frontal lobe development is a really good example so we have this part of our brain called the frontal lobes the par the frontal lobes are the part of our brain that plan and execute tasks so when i think about like oh i need to get a job that can be overwhelming for some people and as we get older as we get mature so there's also this like aspect of maturity right what's the difference between an adult and a child it's maturity well it's a is a 18 year old as mature as a 28 year old no right we all sort of know that so what does that mean maturity so like we all understand it instinctively but practically what maturity boils down to in a neuroscience perspective is like frontal lobe development that's the simplest it's an oversimplification because you can't boil anything down when it comes to the brain but you know simplification is that if you think about maturity a five-year-old a 15-year-old a 25 in a 35 year old will all be different levels of mature and what's different between a 25 year old and a 35 year old it's the development of the frontal lobes so what are the frontal lobes there for what do they do the first is that they plan and execute tasks so when someone says something like you know um i've lived almost my exact same way for a long period of time i feel like i need to do something but i feel paralyzed it's like there's a but all you know there's something getting in the way like the inability to initiate tasks could have to do with the frontal lobes so the frontal lobes are what like break down tasks and like get us to do stuff so like when i'm 19 it's harder to do the dishes than it is when i'm 29. simple example right not precisely true there may be some people who it's very easy to do at 19 may be harder when you're 29 right so but generally speaking like it's easier to do stuff the older that you get when it comes to like boring crap and why is that it's because the frontal lobes also govern impulse control so our susceptibility to impulses if you think about a 14 year old versus a 24 year old what's different the 14 year old is more impulsive a four year old to a 14 year old the four year old is more impulsive so the ability to initiate the right kind of behavior as well as restrict the wrong kind of behavior is all governed by the frontal lobe now here's the thing the frontal lobes finish developing around the age of 30. i personally believe there's no science behind this i personally believe that frontal lobe development is being delayed in our society so what i'm noticing and it just this could be a selection bias this may just be the people that i end up seeing and talking to is that like frontal lobe development is like getting a little bit delayed that the independence that we used to see a hundred years ago from an 18 year old is less than the independence that we see from 18 year olds today there's no data to support that there may be data it's not something i've seen it's just an observation an anecdotal observation i suspect that we may be delaying frontal lobe development we may actually be fully delayed around 32 33 34 actually all right so i know in my experience like i wasn't a real adult until like i was like 30 to be honest that's when i really started becoming an adult in a lot of ways so the first thing to understand is that if you feel like a child in an adult's body like that's sort of true there isn't a child an adult is not binary it's not like suddenly on your 18th birthday legally sure you become an adult in that moment but biologically like there's no difference or i mean there's a tiny amount of difference right there's just your neurons are one hour different between 17 and 18. it's not like some magical transformation that's binary from child to adult your brain is basically the same when you're 17 years and 364 days old in 17 years and 365 days old right the brain is basically the same so cut yourself some slack recognize first of all that it's like you know being an adult is not it's not like you're magically becoming an adult like biologically neuroscientifically at the age of 19. the next thing to understand is that people have their own developmental pace right so life actually i mean sometimes people we think of life as a race but people just develop differently right so some people start puberty at like 10. some people start puberty at like 14. people just have like biologically like our biological clocks are not all the same some people will start to have gray hair at the age of 28. some people have gray hair at the age of 58. our biological clocks are just unique based on our genetics and environmental factors and all kinds of stuff that's true of our developmental trajectory as well like not everyone is a hundred percent focused and has fully developed frontal lobes at the age of 21. like some people have very highly developed frontal lobes at the age of 21. i was not one of those people and that's okay so now so that's sort of a quick segment about like if you're 19 and you feel like you're a child like you may be in some ways and that's actually perfectly fine it doesn't mean that you're doomed for the rest of life so where do people get this idea that now i'm screwed so this comes from comparison right so this is what happens when we start to feel bad about ourselves our mind our mind's ego activates so when i start to feel inferior that's an emote that's an emotion that i experience or shame let's say and then our ego activates and our ego starts to make comparisons this is sort of the vedic model of the mind the tricky thing is that the comparisons that we make sort of reinforce our feelings so i'll give you all just an example that i tend to use fairly often which is you know if i've just been dumped by my girlfriend and i'm feeling bad about myself at two in the morning what am i gonna do i'm gonna log on to her insta and see all the pictures of her having fun with other people i felt bad about myself before and my mind is gonna seek confirmatory things outside of that right and then if there's a picture of her with another guy my mind is going to make all kinds of comparisons right what the hell is going on there like why does it torture me right why do our minds torture us with anxiety with with these kinds of things because that's sort of the function of the ego the ego is looking to make sense of the world right so the way that i feel needs to be mirrored in the outside world so if i'm feeling a little bit insecure and i'm like oh i want to believe i'm i'm attractive i want to be believe i'm attractive i want to believe i'm a good person let me turn to the outside world to give me that confirmation because i don't believe it for myself the problem is that there are all kinds of things that you are good at right like so any 19 year old like sure you may be a couple years behind in terms of schooling and stuff sounds like it actually wasn't your fault because someone screwed up an application but your mind doesn't think that way right like mind doesn't think that way that's not what it does when you're sort of feeling bad about yourself your mind doesn't try to come up with reasons to convince you you're a good person it actually does the opposite it seeks out stimuli and makes comparisons that make that reinforce what you already believe about yourself and then what happens like so now let's talk a little bit about if you're someone who invests in other people instead of yourself so once you feel behind once you feel like you're inferior once you feel like you're a child in an adult's body right so like you should have grown up by now but you haven't and you're afraid that you never will are you worth investing in are you worth effort what's going to happen to effort that you put into you right what's going to be the return on investment the roi if you work on yourself if you believe that you're inferior and you're a man child and you're behind and you're surrounding yourself by 16 years i mean you're surrounded by 16 year olds what happens is the mind naturally sort of concludes right because you're like kind of not you can't fix yourself like you're it's not going to be it's never going to be enough so what do you end up doing you invest in other people because they're worth saving if i try to help someone else like they can actually achieve something but i can't and so then what happens is you start directing your energy towards other people and sometimes in the worst cases you even start living vicariously through them no you absolutely should apply for that job you should do it you should do it you should do it don't don't be a wuss right take chances i faith in you and you push them because you're trying to solve a problem in here but this problem is unfixable because i'm a child in an adult's body gg gg no re go next but not for you now i'm gonna observe i'm gonna watch my friend play and i'm gonna tell them what to do because i'm hopeless so that's where we see that kind of behavior come from and now we get to this part right which is um yeah i've always wanted to feel like being saved and that someone would basically help me get stuff done so where does that come from and that comes from the same place as helping other people which is that investing in myself is going to be insufficient that's why i have to invest in other people because it's like waste of time because like the roi is way too low right so then what do you need you need someone else to save you because you can't save yourself because you're a child trapped in an adult's body because you should have grown up by now because you should be smarter you should be more capable you should not be so lazy you shouldn't be paralyzed to action so you need some savior and that's what you look for because you don't believe you can save yourself and this becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy because where are you investing you're investing in other people is someone going to come along and save you maybe if you're lucky maybe maybe yes maybe not but as you stop working on yourself and you start investing energy in other people you sort of propagate this idea that the only person that can save you is someone else because you're not trying to save yourself at that point right you've given up on yourself so the only that that becomes true and then like logically like it becomes consistent and you start to believe it oh see like i i no one has showed up yet and i'm still in this situation therefore i can't fix it it's kind of tricky it's very tricky and it all comes down to the ego right it all comes down to this perception that i'm a child in an adult's body it all comes down to this idea that since i'm in this state i'm screwed whereas the simple truth is that you're not screwed the simple truth is that you are in this situation chances are because of some contribution of yours or lack of contribution of yours that you invest all of your energy in helping other people and then you wonder why you're still there and of course you need to be saved by someone else right like if i'm if my house is on fire and someone else's house is on fire and i spend all of my water putting out their fire i need someone else to put out my fire because i'm not putting out my own fire myself do i have the water yes but i'm using all my energy externally and so this kind of becomes a cycle so what to do about it the first thing and this is why we kind of started with the the brain stuff is to recognize that this perception that you are a child in an adult's body is false it's like not a real thing so are you behind other people your age sure but you're also ahead of other people your age right like statistically they're going to be 19 year old 19 year olds who like dropped out of school like five years ago they're gonna be 19 year olds who it sounds like you're in relationships from time to time that are going to be 19 year olds who have never been in a relationship or never date and don't even try to help other people but does your mind compare you to them no of course not that's absurd right the mind only makes the comparisons that it wants it needs to to reassure itself of what it already believes and so this is sort of like a tricky situation but it's like totally okay because people development just biologically people develop at different ages it's like not all the same and it's not even necessarily that there's evolutionary advantage to developing early like i don't know that that's true in any shape way shape or form in fact if you kind of look at people having different developmental ages that probably suggests that there's a there's a selection within that window but like whether you hit puberty at 10 or 14 there's really no selection pressure over one over the other right you could sort of assume that but that also i'm not 100 sure you know i i you know there may be people who are experts on the evolution of adolescent development that disagree with that know more about that than i do so what do you do about this the first is to recognize that all of this stuff is like a conclusion that your mind comes to without necessarily being true right that you believe that you are a child in an adult's body which is like it's totally fine to be exactly where you are there's nothing wrong with you could you do things better sure could you work a little bit harder maybe are you a little bit too paralyzed possibly i'm not saying that you're perfect right but you are where you are you're not fundamentally busted second thing is especially in the case of real clinical mental health issues if you do have generalized anxiety disorder or suicidal ideation or things like that and like your those are active clinical illnesses that you're experiencing that can explain a lot of this stuff and it's amazing i mean i don't prescribe antidepressant medication to all of my patients with major depressive disorder but like for some of them it just works amazing like it transforms their life they live like normal people afterwards right that we see that sometimes with antidepressants generally you know your mileage may vary absolutely you need to talk to your doctor about that that's the whole purpose behind having a doctor right is that they can make a tailored individualistic determination about what your needs are the last thing is to recognize this whole thing that as long as you keep investing in other people like you need to really think about why do i not feel like investing in myself it's good to help other people don't get me wrong i'm not saying stop helping other people but why do you think you can't invest in yourself and really explore that try to figure out why do i believe that i'm not worth investing in which is what i sort of read between the lines of this post is that i'm not worth investing it and the other magical thing that will happen is once you sort of explore that hopefully you will start investing in yourself and once you start investing in yourself and you start to see progress you will realize that you do need to be saved and you are actually right the only difference the only thing you didn't realize is the person who needs to save you is actually you you're the one who's gonna do the saving and once you come to that realization then like life is a wide open field then you're empowered then you can do what you want right because you're the one who saved you you're the one who actually had the power to do it you want to get some help along the way totally all for that right maybe sometimes you do need help especially if there's clinical stuff involved that's where like you know you do need someone to potentially save you to just think through it a little bit right don't be quite as judgmental recognize that people move at their own pace like life is not a race people development develop at different paces the brain continues to develop until 30 32 maybe and so it's okay to be a little bit behind because the other interesting thing about life is like i think rested xp speaking of mmos is a really good analogy so if you've been like afk for a while you actually catch up faster than people who regularly progress right and there's a really good general piece of evidence about this which is immigrants so like when immigrants move to a different country you know if i move to a different country if i move to the united states from india when i'm nine years old i know nothing about american customs and so those kids have a nine year head start but by the time i'm 18 we are completely caught up exactly the same i understand american culture just as well as someone who spent 18 years there it's kind of like rested xp like the human brain catches up right that's what it's designed to do so even if you've fallen behind it doesn't mean that you're going to stay behind and so invest a little bit in yourself you know i'm not saying stop helping other people go get a clinical evaluation if you need to or if you're even considering it if you've self-diagnosed yourself with something you should absolutely go at a clinical evaluation and you may be surprised at who ends up doing the saving you have 20 years of arrested xp hey trust me dude i had like 23 years 22 years of rested xp absolutely like now the problem you guys want to know the real tragedy my situation my rested xp is gone now no more catching up right now it's the end game grind hours and hours of work for such little yield [Music] you
