michael had all the baggage of i guess being a black nerd or geek that in a in a environment that was not rewarding for those predetermined identities hello my friend hey oh hello hello dr k what's going on what's going on buddy uh a little a little bit nervous not gonna lie yeah a little bit this is a little bit daunting not gonna lie what's uh so first of all what do you what do you go by and how would you like me to address you today um well normally trihex works um uh if you want to call me michael we can we can roll with that i'm i'm indifferent on it though if you actually wanted my take on that uh i do i made my online tag when i was 13 so i was kind of like i kind of wanted to escape the burden of the iro identity because of like the stuff i was going through at the time here but hey whatever works for you okay so whatever you want to do you tell me try hex or michael what's what's better oh okay sure let's let's go with michael let's let's let's let's break down the the barriers why not okay i'll i'll go there and and i understand you're a little bit nervous look well chronic overthinker so i'm just like uh you just got to ice break so that i don't i'm not so like frigid like you know whatever here you know you know um yeah so can i just share with you why i'm excited for today sure no please go so first of all uh michael i'm i'm a big fan so i really appreciate the way that you you know we have this idea that a gamer is like a degenerate and and you know someone who's like physically out of shape and and things like that and what i really appreciate about some streamers is that they're they model and also demonstrate that like gaming can be a part of a healthy life and you can take care of yourself in other ways too um and so i just appreciate that about you man wow that means a lot i you know that it means a lot because in streaming i find it's it's very difficult because the occupation really wants to reward degeneracy you know just stay up late no regulation on schedule cover all your time zones delegate eating out and ordering take out all the time here that way you're not stuck doing any time intensive activities like cooking and just fitness or even just discipline on on physical just eats away all of that meal prep working out gym going to and from gym just wake up turn over shower skip stream that's literally how else you're going to do you know 14 hour streams daily yeah so minor soap box there but like yeah it's a it's definitely putting in a lot of work on that and trying to it i'm i'm continually fighting to find the balance yeah we wouldn't pay outcome you know it almost sounds like you have to choose between taking care of yourself and taking care of your streaming career yes oh i think there's definitely a war with that continuously yeah so i i'd love to hear michael just your story and and you know how you came to be where you are if there's some small way in which we can be helpful we'd love to but um i'd love to just hear a little bit about you and and get to know who you are okay well um so let's see here we can start first with the fact that uh i've been twitch streaming a lot longer than a lot of people i was around i started broadcasting in february 2011 so about four months before twitch was even a thing um so i was at twitch on day one back in uh yeah back in july 2011. um but my my roots go even further back than that i've been a competitive gamer uh speedrunner i've been speed running since uh 2004. wow um yeah yeah yeah so i was uh so my first recorded speed run was like um was actually done before even youtube was a thing youtube didn't happen until 2005. so i was you know i was 15 years old i thought i was like hot stuff i was uh well i kind of actually think i kind of was at the time here i was recording speed runs and super plays and super game plays on my grandmother's vcr at her house and she had the good internet so i was always i would go every weekend when i was 15 i'd go over there and like i would practice at my house all week long and i go over there and just like you know grind and getting this like sick run that i felt looked inhuman so so precise and everything else here and uh yeah i actually would mail my vhs tapes off to um to a website that would act at the time would host and convert the vhs tape to digital mp4 video but yeah i was uh i was really really good at mario um you know that that and that felt very validating um prior to that i was actually a competitive yu-gi-oh player in in middle school wow um so i was the bottom of the totem pole and social hierarchy because uh i i noteworthy here i i grew up in um in a rural small town in louisiana very very small um so you know being into remember back here like 2003 here right so at that time anime was not mainstream accepted it was it was very much like um belittled um in a way here i guess i would say sure definitely you know what's the good word yeah yeah the the how do i put this here it's like when you're in middle school in high school the toxic hierarchy of like popularity is very like superficial and if you're not with the hive mind of the other big fish you get eaten alive so in short because i wasn't doing what the other kids already were doing um i was uh i was ostracized as like weird or nerdy or whatever um now this is also even further reinforced by the fact that i'm black and so because i was the only black kid playing yu-gi-oh and into dragon ball and anime and also the other nerds in the library doing all this stuff here because i was the only black kid in there which again i didn't see racist regard at all here um but you know the other kids because of how i guess they were raised in this small town felt that way and uh so i got belittled a lot by the other black kids by um being told that hey why are you acting so white why you why are you into all what they do why aren't you why aren't you doing what we do or whatever and it was always like a very like not like a um not like an intrigued uh engagement it was always like uh they felt like i was attacking judgmental and i was attacking them when again and they're the ones that initiated the conversation i'm not even the one approaching them you know i i wasn't different towards whether they were in 2002 or not here but that definitely attacked my insecurities a ton here because i felt like well dang am i not being okay maybe their logic is correct here maybe i'm not being black enough maybe i'm not uh being valid in my identity maybe there is a racial war obligation to [Music] change my interest to be publicly presentable in middle school in high school i felt it was getting gaslit hardcore there and it really ate me at me hard and by extension you know going through puberty and during teenagehood um when it came to like romance i just felt like i couldn't even like it was it was it was it was daunting i couldn't even like talk to girls because i was just so chronically overthinking on like well what what do i talk about because like you know the boys are showing me for being into anime and dragon ball and all the cool things i think i'm into so if i talk to a girl what what do i even what do i open with you know i can't open with do you what do i even do do you do you play yugioh what deck do you mean do you do you think magic cylinders are top tier card yeah yeah i don't i don't know i really i just so i i famously say here that like at the time i felt like i was stuck in this like pyramid of confusion where like i felt like girls would say one thing but they meant a different thing but they were thinking a third thing and so if that's what i perceive that they were doing and therefore i'm like okay well i have to like i have to be what i think they want me to be and then hide who i really am and then pre-plan my next thought and have my next reply to what they'll say to what i think they'll want me to be continuously and just you know i'm just i'm i'm yeah i'm frying up all you know i'm really out of ram i can't download any more ram at this point my my my cpu was fraud even trying to figure all that out so yeah yeah that was um can i just that was sorry yeah can i just kind of summarize what i what i heard for a second sure please wow michael it sounds like actually being michael was tough uh yeah yeah i you know things didn't get better until college i would say for sure yeah um i'm just noticing how many different judgments and identities you were juggling right so the first is like you're a nerd but you're a black nerd and the other nerds are not they don't have the same color of your skin you know and and i'm not hearing that you actually got necessarily a whole lot of discrimination from them correct but it was really about sort of like this preconceived identity of like what it means to be black yes and and whether you fit into that mold right and and people sort of almost discriminating against you for having interests that were not traditionally like i mean there was there's this idea which i think is absurd which we sort of understand now but back in the day i mean i it's still something that i struggle with as well but you know that if you're of a particular race or ethnicity you're supposed to like particular things correct yeah and sort of struggling with that and sort of trying to figure out who you are and and not really being a popular kid because of your interest so like the popular kids are kind of like on your case and then even people that you know potentially could have been good healthy relationships because of your race and your interests that was challenging for you and then we sort of opened the door to any kind of romance kind of stuff where there's like layers of thinking and overthinking and and you know it's almost like you're treating a a interaction with someone from the opposite sex like a strategic play in yugioh where it's like like trap card and then like i gotta do this and then like we gotta do this and this and then if i play this they're gonna do this and they're gonna think i'm doing this and they're like i can't let them see that this is my aim that's a very good way to put it here though i think at the time it was i was terrified of rejection i don't think i could take it i was already rejected by most of the kids there like i don't think i'm the bottom of the social poll like i'm the only black kid playing yu-gi-oh in the library in the morning so i'm the nerdiest one there by far and i don't know if i could handle another rejection i already felt so miniscule in the self-worth sure i would just i i thrived and i just by like ninth grade i just like said okay whatever like let's just do it and so my goal was to become a god-like yugioh player like i don't need i don't need their validation i'll just like go in and find my own in my own piece i think it's interesting almost that you went into yu-gi-oh that feels tied together to me that you know like your your passion for gaming almost grew out of the ashes of like almost like a normal life that may that sounded a bit dramatic but yes yes i mean it was my calling maybe yeah i don't i don't know that that's uh and you know a lot of this now like i'm even me just narrating and giving you like the like the narrator pov alongside what was happening at that time here it was all stuff i didn't really acknowledge until like years later like i don't think i really understood how damaging the whole like uh middle school high school social hierarchy was until like i was like 25 years old i really didn't think i really got it until uh twitch popularity really hit me and then all those demons came back in 2015 i would say you mentioned that things got better for you in college can you tell us a little bit about that sure um so once i um so once i graduated i got into college i uh or particularly was community college um i was still too too too broke to actually like go to like big boy university so i just kind of like took like you know low-key community college while alongside while working just to kind of like i don't know get things going here my mom told me it was really important so like not take that year off of after high school like you know because you're gonna get the don't once and then you're gonna just like idle forever which i think is like some really good advice here but uh she told me that i ended up going to community colleges taking a bunch of like filler courses didn't really have an idea of what to do i didn't even look into if i could even transfer credits and whatnot just kind of like in there to like be there and do something but when i was in college uh the the environment there was just way more relaxed you know you know people are coming in their pajama pants there's no like scrutiny over how you dress or how you look you know it was just i don't know if nothing felt it felt more like the real world where no one really cares how you're dressing as long as you're just like baseline presentable in society and that felt really refreshing you know you can just make friends and it not be like again this like gathering popularity clout chase that i and maybe my high school was just like particularly bad and maybe it's more of a remnant of like just small town usa where there's just a lot of hive mind going on there and when you're in a more metro city there's more diversity and therefore by extension there's like less scrutiny on because there's so many groups right you i imagine like a big high school in like houston texas would probably have an anime club for example but if you're in a small town if you ain't hunting and fishing then you're you're that you're the outcast yeah and people love to judge what they don't understand wow um so but yeah and when i was in college yeah it got a lot better i felt way more just normal uh and less insecure just being myself yeah i think sometimes in college you know we're busy living our own life and in high school and middle school we're busy living everyone else's you know and it's like what is this person dressing like that becomes a part of my life that's what i think about that's what i comment on i'm so concerned with other people whereas in college it's like i don't have time to dress to impress you know this is true yeah definitely that uh it's funny reading the background because uh um so my high school had uh school uniforms well my entire state high school uniforms you got to wear like khaki pants and like a um and a polo button up but which is meant to like you know um uh make everyone's income level and distinguishable that way you can't like you know wear like you know fancy brands and whatnot and so it's funny though because shoes were not regulated in this regard you can wear whatever shoes you want here so it's just funny because that that policy kind of backfired because then what became so important for expression was shoes like at this point now whether you had on jays or air force ones or you know narachi's or whatever here or tim's like that was like the thing so it's kind of like hyper focused on shoes so it's just yeah and you're right if somebody bought new shoes that was like the topic of the day like i don't know again incredibly and not that being superficial is negative just when it's like superficial to a um aggressive almost animosity sense is whenever it was like draining a little bit there i would say yeah absolutely you know i think it i i sort of experienced the same thing that people are gonna find ways to distinguish in social hierarchies and you can restrict particular things but then it'll be you know like a particular set of binders or a particular set of shoes or particular watches or particular things and people will find ways to develop a pecking order definitely and so what can you uh tell me a little bit so it sounds like college went like okay for you in the sense that you started to really uh not be made fun of not really judged quite as harshly people were more concerned and so what where where did kind of streaming come in and and what ended up happening okay so what happened here was uh so i did my first speed run in 2004. i was an active member of that community well really in what game uh for yoshi's island um super mario world two issues island the one where you play is yoshi and you shoot the eggs at stuff yeah i'm like really really really really good at that one um i don't want to bore you with the details of it here but yeah uh that's like the game i like i'm iconically uh known for um so i was asking i'm sorry um i i yu-gi-oh was getting stupid i i did not agree with some rules that happened there not that i don't want to boy with you laurie either here but uh so because yu-gi-oh was getting whack which is saying a lot because now you give us extra whack now at this point 20 years later why do i assume that the the rules will bore me um oh because it's like it's it's telling it's like michael i i'd love to hear it oh my god okay well so well okay well first the reason why i thought if you would find it boring is because like it's just like technical jargon that i don't i i fear i fear that it's not as interesting to the healthy game audience so i hate to give you that medicine fashion here but okay if if you if you okay so in late 2004 there was a particular set of yugioh cards uh called invasion of chaos that came out in japan it was coming to usa pretty soon afterward here this particular set was insanely broken and had unprecedented uh resource management that was completely unethical in the context of how previously when you would have monsters die because they would attack one another a monster goes to the graveyard it's supposed to remain in the graveyard but now essentially what happens is you can now rfg monsters abandoned from the graveyard and use that as a cost be able to summon these 3 000 attack beat sticks that can go ahead and annihilate anything on the board for practically nothing and when they do do that they get uh byproduct effects that are able to further push your advantage it's completely ridiculous so essentially what you can do now is just like play a card dump five things into your graveyard um rfg two of them bring up your super big dragon and just go ahead and pay 1000 points and win the game so it's essentially like rather than your opponent having any capability to like do anything about it here it's just kind of like press the win button and then turn off your brain and then you already win it's like it's really really really really toxic and these cards were so overpowered and so overwhelming that like um this they became known as staples and so like there was no debt creativity because this this meta was so dominant and and quite frankly economically they didn't care at all here because these cards were because they were they were ultramares they were like yeah they were gonna sell yeah these things were like you needed three hundred dollars to even get this debt going here they were called chaos decks here and to get this thing going here and they were so overwhelmingly powerful there what were we gonna do so the game became like obnoxiously pay to win and they did at the time before it was cool and if you're a teenager you know i was influenceable so i just thought you know yeah this is definitely the uh this is you know i yeah we didn't know that we have those terms of time here i just thought that bouncing was really really bad you know you got the match gathering kids always making fun of you kids saying that your game is trash you need to like you need to ban the entire set here and then you kids like no no no you're just not good you're gonna get skill and just and in hindsight now i'm like i got tired of it but then here's the catalyst here's a breaking point so japan had had a they introduced a banned list because at the time here there was no banned cards it was only cars that were limited to one and even having one copy of some of these cards were incredibly broken and changed the entire deck here garbage like yada garasu and chaos emperor dragon and blackbuster soldier were just completely broken and needed definitely some kind of like nerfing of some kanye all together here much less limited to one so japan finally said okay we have enough of this this is meta it's actually bonkers and they introduced a banned list where like 15 cards or more were abandoned at the first generation of this ban list and i told my community my community oh my god uh told my local high school friends hey i have the japanese ban list here remember this is 2004. so we have like printers we don't have smartphones here so like i printed out the sheet and i'm like hey translated banned list here y'all want to play it because i'm kind of tired of like throwing probably yeah i don't even know how i even had the money to get these cards here i'm thinking back now when i was 15 was i like was i like hustling like chocolate milk cartons and whatnot to get these cards i don't even know how i got this stuff in the first place here but i'm sure i've traded a copy of a game here and there i think i remember trading ratchet and clink for ps2 for like a for like a cannon soldier or something i don't even remember at this point um but yeah i um my community rejected it they were like no i work too hard to get these cards no i'm not gonna i'm not gonna that bayless is wack to me and i'm like well you know it's gonna come to america eventually right usually konami japan is gonna you know prelude what happens in konami usa they're gonna bring here eventually they didn't want to do it they didn't want to hear it they didn't want to adopt it because here's what happened this was crazy here konami usa was like oh well you know what this makes a lot of money here we're going to have two formats we're going to have the ban list and the not banned list where it's limited to one here so everyone had the option to remain on the traditional list and i'm just like oh yeah now no one's ever gonna play the game that's gonna be like in my opinion fun and better here and strategically diverse so i was like hey this is wack this is dumb i'm bored of this this is so exhausting this is literally a pay to win turn off your brain press the win button call it a day thing here so it was at that point that my disdain for for yu-gi-oh at that time i hate you again for other reasons now by the way here but at that time that's whenever i kind of like moved on was like okay well speed running is a thing that i was passively interested in and earlier for but now by late 2004 i'm like yo this is like my thing now so awesome i wanted to take that uh take that and go somewhere which on that note last trivia about that here uh the name that my my tag trihex actually came from when i won my first online yugioh tournament in like late 2003. how did i i had a weight corner name back then and i um and once i got my first dub in a tournament i was like ooh no i'm a i'm a i'm a yu-gi-oh duelist now let's go i need a i need a sick tag dude so i i just you know me my scrub self in photoshop at age 13 i was like you know ooh polygon lasso tool i can make a hexagon i just put three hexagons together and triple hexagon shortened for trihex what was that yeah so that's so that's when trihex came in to play from yugioh competitively and then it just carried into what i registered my name as on the speedrun community i i'm so glad you shared that yeah so i'm glad you enjoyed it i'm serious i'm i mean there's clearly so much passion maybe maybe a touch of trauma maybe a touch you know i mean it's wild because people it's wild because people don't know how to read cards either so like whenever you had a so thank you now this isn't going to take for granted right in 2004 again no one has a smartphone no one has like a laptop nearby no one has wi-fi so like when there's a dispute over how a card works how do you resolve that that that conflict and it was like so i had to think in advance here and bum my grandma's printer with her expensive overpriced hp ink and just like print out the rule sets for those known problem cards i knew these boys were not going to be able they was going to assume the best faith in their favor of how the cards operated so i had to like you know bring them that and they would still argue with me about it so yeah i got some yukio players don't like to read i'll tell you that much for sure it is a toxic to say the least they also cheated on they they why do you want to um i don't want to make this about you all day here because you'll be let's take a step back let's maybe talk about a couple other things but if you know if all roads lead to home then that's where they lead and if this ends up being a two-hour yu-gi-oh rant stream like let's you know let's get it let's do what we need to do do the work that needs to be done you know no it's not it's not yeah it's not that serious um okay so you started speed running and that's wild by the way like recording things on vhs tapes and like mailing them to places to be uploaded like this yeah there was a website called speedimo's archive and um the staff there notably had like a bunch of equipment where they would convert vhs to digital video and uh yeah they really were passionate about lifting up the speedrun scene you know before youtube they have been off to 2003. so yeah they had a bunch of speed runs at first it was just metroid and quake if i recall correctly but they quickly expanded to the other game section and the other game section like blew up because everyone was submitting stuff from you know banjo-kazooie to goldeneye to mario kart to everything in between and they couldn't keep up and i want to hop on that scene i wanted to be a super gamer i wanted to validate my existence i found great uh great validation and pride and dare i say purpose uh with that um i at age 15 i had that whole like i don't know if everyone goes here the whole existential crisis where you're like you know what's the point of life you know we're all going to die anyway on that kind of thought in people's minds i'm not quite sure here but they hit me really really hard and i um and i was trying to figure out well if i die tomorrow what's my legacy and i started having started becoming infatuated with the idea of like okay well try hex has a legacy michael has nothing i felt uh again high school was just like not and middle school was just not there very sucked how how was it uh and by the way uh michael i i just wanna can i just share a couple things that have come out of your mouth that i would love to ask you about because i think there's actually a lot of wisdom so one is you you've talked about overthinking you use the phrase pyramid of confusion you talked about how people love to judge what they don't understand you talked about maybe your mom's saying if you take a year off you're going to get the a case of the don't wants and you'll be an idol forever um and then you're also talking about this like kind of conflict between purpose and and michael versus trihax and and you know one has a life that they want to run away from and one has a life that is optimistic and and growing and has a lot of potential so can you tell me a little bit more about just like so what was it like to want to run away from michael if that's fair to say and and run towards trihex well so again michael michael had all the baggage of i guess being a black nerd or geek that in a in a environment that was not rewarding for those predetermined identities i didn't choose to be black and i i don't know whatever like do you choose your interest i guess you just kind of you get infatuated whatever you run into over time here so there was baggage there i got i got called white mike a ton uh in high school um that i i found very i felt i wanted to avoid a conflict so i never want i was never one to like really pump up confrontation and call that out i mean it was just a bunch of black kids maybe they want the fight maybe they did in here but um comparatively when i was try hex it was like none of the identity none of the identical identical uh identifiers oh my god words uh were were relevant just my my gamer skill and my my legacy like i was super into that um [Music] so i i you know i things like learning photoshop and really getting further on graphic design getting better at drawing i i i could draw pretty well i i had ambition i wanted to all the things that i desire to do just were not aligned with like what i had experienced thus far in middle school in high school so i wanted to i loved pixar i loved animation i loved cartoons i wanted to work at pixar before i died and i wanted to um do everything i could to help develop that skill set getting to that point so um i felt like speed running was a great way to keep me afloat until then i guess okay and so uh help me understand you know from i guess right now you're in college or in the speed running scene uh you know between 2004 and 2011 when you started streaming like what was that what were those years like so 2004-2001 that is mostly me just like this is this important actually we'll say this is important um when i'm speed running i am i'm producing um the final result the the run right the the the perfect run that i'm trying to get here mistake-free and all that i'm producing that in isolation i am uh i'm usually at my house to myself maybe i'm watching like i don't know a movie on two tvs or whatever here side by side while i'm like grinding my runs all day and whatnot while recording on the vcr um but most importantly i'm i'm in my isolation i'm in my flow i'm i'm in my flow state i'm getting better i'm addicted to the progress and i'm continually seeing myself top myself over and over again and getting even better than what my starter goal was and it's very very fulfilling um however i do think that people only really care about the end result they don't want to see the making of you don't want to watch a director like make the movie you want to watch the movie so by 2011 when streaming becomes a little more uh palatable mostly in the context of racing the government's up here uh people were racing each other so it's like you know me and you that's 1v1 race mario brothers 3 right and we just like broadcast it live on like justin tv or wherever right and that was that was the idea but people also were taking that and piggybacking off the idea of streaming the races into also streaming like world record attempts and speed runs so once i saw that in 2011 i was like wait wait wait people will watch people grind like the repetitive grueling 99 fail rate of grinding to get the result people will watch that that blew my mind so whenever i like tried it out in february 2011 i was blown away that i had like you know 25 viewers on day one um because i was like because before remember for like six years seven years it was in it was like it was purely for myself it was a self sure fulfilling thing but now it was like other people are interested yeah i had an audience and i was like or you know a community i was like whoa okay let's because i was already some of his time here i i i also know worthy here i never went through the whole like single viewer the single digit viewer slump where you know it's like it's like a it's like a uh coliseum to get out of here to even get to that like even the 10 to 10 viewer account because it's so saturated now right but i never dealt with that i was already notable at the very jump because i had years of uh prerequisite skill to show my gamer cloud i guess there and so can you tell us michael a little bit about what your life has been like since you started streaming so kind of catching us up from today till you know maybe like over the last 10 years and you know we can go into more detail here there but what's it like being a streamer um it being a well okay there's there's two distinction here's two distinctions here there was being a part-time streamer while trying to juggle working at a job elsewhere alongside dealing with irl you know the typical struggle right your part-time stream but you could stream better if you had you can do it full-time that way you could put more effort into it that was 2011 to 2015. 2015 onwards when i became full-time and that's all that's those are two very different beasts i would say so if you're asking about full-time tell me about part-time streaming okay uh part-time streaming was a time management galore i i just i felt like i could never do it enough when i was like so i was a student um i did go to big boy university i was a student um sorry i was like i'm sorry i was a full-time um full-time student until fall 2012. so 2011 to 2012 i barely streamed i i did like two nights a week if anything here because i had like a crap ton of homework like any other full-time student um didn't get much deep either honestly just kind of like you know completely grueling um but i i saw that i had the potential i really really believe that i could actually grow as a streamer if i had the opportunity to really give it a shot because i saw other streamers of time here they were they were doing uh ocarina of time and mario 64. and they were blowing up to you know i don't know i hate to make it superficial here about the view count but like that's kind of the metric we all had the time here so you know they were getting to 300 viewers i was sitting here stagnant at 50 viewers for a very long time because i could only put in so much time per week so i um i decided to drop out of university i'd say drop out i i paused university i i can resume whenever i wanted to um but i was scared dead getting her because my grandmother um she's a teacher and she was teaching for 34 years so she's very old school on like you know education that's how you get things going here and i um so i i paused university in fall 2012 just to give it a shot for full effort and uh at that point it was it was crazy i was i was growing a lot more at that time though i'm making more about this here now the um what i would say what happened here is that um this is where like the start of like imposter syndrome came into play because i i became known so well for being the best at yoshi's island and now that um the community had grown um i was i was not number one i was uh i think i was i was number eight i was top eight and i felt like i needed to get number one um i was perceived as the i was the most popular yoshi speedrunner but i wasn't the best one um and maybe it has to do with the fact that you know i had a you know again this door gets technical here but like when it comes to muscle memory i was the original innovator of all the routes um that we had now in yoshi's island for 100 and so i have like thousands of hours on what was the best route using only my feedback here back in 2004 2005. so i mailed those routes back then the community was coming because of the streaming was happening now so now we're from just being also yeah not worth it here i was the only ocean island speedrunner for like six years so um so whenever the community was coming because of streaming now there was like no 10 20 runners and i'm getting i'm i'm getting passed up honestly because we have now collaboration they're they're showing off new routes and it's harder for me to get them because i have like i have to it's not really easy to delete muscle memory you should only really just overwrite it with like more grinding so i kind of have like a i would dare say an upper hill battle to deal with but regardless of that though i was the most popular um streamer for youtube at that time so being the most popular one the most viewed one but not the best at the game did give me some kind of conflicts over that i needed i needed to validate myself by getting to number one help me understand that what what what part of you needed to validate like what helped me understand that um that's hard to i don't know that was like i feel like if you're you're an imposter well that there was this really toxic notion in early streaming of speeding at the time here that you're a sellout um that if you people can donate to you and if you do you're doing it for donations and support and you're not doing it for the love of the game like speed branch should remain pure there were some some a lot of toxic silly ideas that were high roading a lot here and it usually came from the camps that had a lower view count that might have been envious dare i say jealous of those who were more successful at it possibly um hard to say really here but i i do feel like imposter syndrome does whenever i learned what that was actually did does really um to me feel like what i was going through at that time and can you i can just tell you that i didn't i did not i did not allow myself to enjoy streaming until i got world record i was not i did not want to play other games i didn't want to play mario party i didn't play casual games it was yoshi and only yoshi because i had to get better at yoshi what what did it mean to you to get world record everything it meant that i could finally have inner peace it finally meant that like i am what i think i am that that like the what what trihex is perceived as and what michael is are one in the same finally rather than like i don't know like i'm just like i'm i'm this gamer who already peaked and i can't do it i see so can i ask a couple questions about that sure so here's what i'm kind of i'm going to try to sort of try to piece this together a little bit you let me know if this resonates or not but so there was michael right white mike and then trihex came on the scene and trihex's the best yoshi's island streamer speedrunner whatever and so you know on the inside you're michael and on the outside your trihax and everyone expects you've kind of used this term over and over and over again where you kind of said you're top eight but you'll sort of highlight the fact that you were perceived as the best or maybe the most popular right there's this i but like if we really look at it it's even hearing you talk about it it's like you'll give us evidence to the contrary even when you tell the story because you'll kind of say i was perceived as the best but i was top eight you know and and so even hearing you talk about it i'm almost and now it's sort of it just kind of clicked for me that like getting world record means that what people expect of you is actually true yeah you you nailed it that yes like that that like this is what the world perceives me as and there's a there's almost a sense that until you get that world record you've debated people into believing something that you're not and and maybe a part of you is even terrified possibly that you may not have been able to live up to expectations not maybe you're exactly that i was that if that were the truth that truth terrified me that i actually couldn't do it um and that comes back in the play later on here in 2015 onward how so um i honestly thought i had peaked i i really did so i love yoshi's island my favorite game of all time um and i grew to hate playing it because i was reminded of how not good i was at it in my own head like when you speed run continuously because i think i've been running the game for i have at least 15 000 hours in the game since 2004 a loose estimate here a conservative one at that two by the way here um and in one game and uh in one category and i to this day i'm i'm 10th place now um my my best time is from may of um i the the the new the the new runners now they're over 10 minutes faster than me which is like a huge deal like just insane growth that's happened since then it feels daunting it feels like like the game celeste it feels like i'm climbing like 10 of those like to get there because of the mental endurance the insecurities the i feel like i can i can never get there okay and uh and not playing the game or uh i'm sorry let me cut you off there no go ahead oh um i i feel like you can't um how do i put this here it's just like no matter how hard i try i will never get there the it's it's grueling it's grueling yeah i love the game i want to play it i i feel like i should enjoy it but because of just how exhausting this to acknowledge where i currently am i hate where i am i hate where i am i love improving but i want to be able to improve in private that's that's actually what it is here i don't want to stream improving at the game i just want to be better at the game i i crave the destination and i loathe having to like do that in a transparent manner for streaming here so it's like if i became like a like a literal who alt account no webcam the microphone no no requirement of interaction where i just grind the game and become like a junkie game playing robot i could probably get there in six to 12 months but because i have to like balance interacting with chad and like being a charismatic streamer and all that it just and then being reminded of like you know who has world record and what i don't have and what happened and everything else here just draining man can i think for a second sure there's a lot there yeah i'm sorry that was that uh no don't apologize that's that's that was positive feedback how do you feel about being challenged michael like now um i'm excited i i do spew in other games um being challenged i i would say when i feel prepared if i have time to prepare i can thrive oh no yeah i was gonna make a couple statements that may challenge you in this moment or ask a couple of questions oh oh oh so okay so go for it well i mean hold on a second because you just said i'm okay being challenged if i can prepare but like you're not prepared for this so maybe we should steer clear um i guess i was thinking of it purely in like the gaming gaming context but yeah i um um well this is this is different like okay like yeah this is like psychologically challenged right there's like there's like no like i'm not pretending that i'm emotionally sound or that i'm like mentally like pristine here so like i'm on healthy gamer right so it's like yeah i this is different to me than like i feel it's in a different venue entirely than like the competitive gaming space or the or the war of perception in internet land so michael what i really i appreciate so much about what you've said um because i i think you've got i think you put towards so well what a lot of what we struggle with the one thing that has really jumped out to me is improving in private okay and there's a part of us we all want to be number one but what what why do we all want to improve in private how do you understand that part of you um because oh that's a good question here uh so if we go back to like 2018 i used to say it was because i had performance anxiety i would say that like chat i play better offline i swear i did one hour i i'm not want to do this here actually there was a point where it was really getting to me and i and i acknowledge you okay maybe maybe i start blaming factors of mental rather than just like factors of the execution here so rather than me like i'm not doing enough practice okay maybe it's the stress of like having to do it with a front with a live audience so i was starting to do like dirty offline practice that would do a one-hour session just like you know chill put on some lo-fi whatever here just vibe you know get back in my get back in my like dare i say renaissance flow state of 2005 where i would just be it would just be me and me and myself and there was no like threat of like how how how many viewers can i retain while doing it or how you know whatever here because the reality here is we haven't talked about here in the context of speed running it's not even it's it's 90 mental to me like because everyone's good at the game but are you good at the game when you're on your best pace ever when you're on world record pace when you have like triple your normal audience size you can see that view count getting dumb you can see the chat and you're performing what does that do to you scrolling fast oh you it what it does is it exposes exactly how confident you are you can bring it down to a to an exact percentage number here that one trick that you want to do on on whatever in world five five four the five four skip if you are not feeling 99 confident in that trick you're going to fail it like because you're going to have it's in your head run free you get you got you have to extract all doubt and get it out there you need to be able to and what is what is the chat scrolling fast what are the high numbers you use the word threat um yes um because i don't want to fail again because it's the same thing over and over again you're just like you you got to like burn and choke 50 to 100 runs before you even finally feel like you are before you feel like you're confident you have to actually be in that the familiarity of that scenario to finally understand um that what you're fearing is debatably irrational you know you nail it in practice why are you feeling secure now you know why is that the eyeballs got you feeling that kind of way at this point now okay so yeah so michael uh yeah yeah i'm sorry go ahead all right let me ask you a couple questions so what if i were i'm going to toss something out you let me know if this sticks or not okay there's a part of me that wonders and i'm going to say some statements that are challenging okay so and we're going to hopefully if i upset you or say something that's out of line please let me know and i realize i'm talking it up too much i don't think it's actually gonna be like that or anything but i'm maybe i'm thinking about my own experiences but part of what i think is alluring about improving in in private is that sometimes we have a doubt that we may not be able to right so there's sort of this idea that if i do it publicly you've shared with us what the challenges of like all the viewers and things like that it lives rent-free in your head and and you need to be in that flow state you need to in order to crack that record in in order to get to the top in order for michael to become trihex you have to be operating at 100 and any amount of twitch chat scrolling any amount of viewers or any amount of that other stuff that is not when you have you know been mozart or bin bach and so there's that aspect of streaming and sort of juggling things and stuff like that which i completely i completely get i think that makes a lot of sense we can talk more about that but there's a part of me that actually wonders like you know now you're number 10 you used to be number eight there's a part of me that that wonders if there's a part of you that thinks that as these people like and i can almost hear the rationalizations in your head that i got to be number one you know without any kind of feedback without learning from other people the kids are younger now they're they're you know they're faster they're stronger they're you know like there are people who can grind 15 000 hours whereas like there you are drinking what appears to be a protein shake like you know i'm looking at you in your under armour tea and it's like you take care of yourself and and things like that you know you got bills to pay and got to pay your taxes and stuff like that and there are these kids out there that just all they can do is is grind and there's a part of me that wonders like if you're in private like you can at least fail in private that's a good way to put that yeah yeah and and i wonder if part of the reason i'm free from scrutiny yeah and the real thing about free from scrutiny is it comes down to and i think a big part of this why do you need to be free from scrutiny and the more you doubt yourself the more that you start to wonder like will i ever be number one again because like you know let's i mean let's be honest like every generation gets better right like yeah you know 100 years ago the chess grand masters were like in their 60s and then they were in their 40s and then they were in their 30s and you know like the the best go players in the world i think are like 19. and and what we're sort of it's the same thing actually in speed running you're not you're not you're making a real some really good parallel points here um yeah and speed running is the same thing the the kids are younger um i'm sure covid quarantine probably further accelerated that entirely here with the fortnite kids and whatever else in between um yeah everyone the they're getting they're getting younger they're getting stronger they're getting faster the resources to to the knowledge here i mean i imagine in chess might be parallel here the you know chess three is probably way more palatable mainstream now than it was maybe in the 70s or 60s clearly and uh yeah yeah now you if you want to get good at mars 64 it's it's you're like three wikipedia articles away from knowing everything the world record holder knows literally so so what does that mean for you um what what does what does just just the fact that people are you know younger faster stronger they can they can climb so you you're you're a trailblazer right so you work really hard to get so far and you're you know you're you're literally like making a trail that the people behind you can just run down whereas each inch of that trail was something that you had to you know make it does it doesn't really bother me that um there are other people better actually no one's really uh toxic uh i would say to me no one's like no one belittles me it was all it was all a war in my head um so help me understand that because i i'm happy to hear you're in a good place but how did you get there because i can imagine that well well let's not i wouldn't say i'm in a great i'm still working through issues on yoshi's island honestly um i would i just say that there's like uh they're how do i put this here there was bullying i don't know how to put this here this is like okay okay i'll just i'm just gonna throughout that because i don't know how to make this like a more palatable way to say it here so 4chan there was a group on 4chan called speedrun general called srg this was like a 4chan anonymous message board group that would usually like um this was like one of the more larger um [Music] spectator groups in speed running but speed running was very very young in 2011 and whatnot and uh i feel like i got i got a lot of i got a lot of attacks from them it's a really toxic group i am not a fan of that at all here um uh but they uh i got a lot of attacks there because um i was talkative i guess i would say here i was less about the game i would i would i would talk a lot major context we haven't gotten to here yet was i was a waiter for eight years um the the job i did alongside being um a university student and everything else here from 2007 to 2015 when i went full time i was a waiter so naturally being a waiter you're just you're just doing social engineering on steroids at all times here so i'm able to like pinpoint and figure out here like when am i taking too long to a point that keeps you continuously engaged how to get how to keep the physical conversation well i'm trying to demonstrate mastery of body language that might come off as approachable accessible um and charismatic and relatable to anyone i'm talking to and whatnot here getting a feel and a vibe for why you're currently at the restaurant are you here on a movie date you got to be somewhere by a certain point are you here to like you know milk it are you here to like you know you are here to watch the football game and therefore to be more minimalistic and that way i'm not intruding on your on the the on the the the football game or whatever here etcetera you know has its advantages yeah it's also running too because it's all about you know it's all about optimizing here you know when to uh you know because i i know that once i get your order in there we can slow the pace down considerably it's all about the acceleration thank you michael yeah yeah yeah i i've been told that um yeah so i i i did that i did that a ton and uh particularly here i was always really keen for like if you were stuck on an indecisiveness like you know i want to get your order in because you're hungry and the timer is taken here whether we've ordered your food or not here in the context of your hunger so i will make it my great effort here to make the conversation as conversational as possible rather than more transactional so i'm trying to like you know throw you uh my recommendations my top three i would go for the most popular dishes what i like why i like it that way you feel more uh welcome to like tell me you're talking or you're thinking about doing you know etc right so anyways here i was awaited for a long period of time and and that that like um that kind of like exuded into my um my streaming you know what after i would do a run i would have like so many because again i wasn't toasting i would i not during the run yeah but afterwards yeah yeah i was in flow state i would better talk during the run and then when i'm done i'm so overwhelmed by questions i'm taking each question from chat here and i'm able to like actually take what they're asking and extend the dialogue of what they're asking you're asking me about my controller but you really want to know like how why i'm holding control the way i am so i'll just answer that question with more collaboration on what you're getting to and it ended up being like you know like i would say like maybe like four hours would be gameplay and the remaining three would be me just talking because i had so much to say about what people were asking about and what did fortunately say again what did 4chan think about that oh they hated it they thought it was a sellout they thought i was a i don't know like not a real speed runner because every time they every time they would tune in i'm always just talking and yapping or whatever just haters uh but again i was insecure maybe as a remnant of the middle school high school thing i i did feel some irrational obligation to be liked by everybody um and again maybe because of just remnants from that there and it would really get at me a lot um in fact it made me almost quit it made me almost uh i can say here with no light heart dr k that i december 22nd 2014. that was the day that i wrote a paste bin um that i really didn't know i was gonna do next there was a charity race that was uh that was going on here um it was a cherries between me and that at that point uh number one uh the number one runner by the way we didn't get earlier uh i was number two at one point i was number eight whenever uh in 2012 but by 2014 through just scathing amounts of grinding and enduring i did get to number two um and me and the number mean the number one went for a race but he was way more consistent than me so like i i failed all the hard tricks and i was uh ten minutes behind and i was getting berated by that chat and there was a lot of them that were from that community that were out um yeah hitting me really hit me hard like you know kill yourself and you're trash and you'll never be good and i guess in their eyes thought it was like you know just banter but i i i'm saddened that i still remember that eight years ago to this day yeah and the next day i was just like i this is not why i got into speedrunning this is not why i got into streaming this like how i feel right now sucks and my self-worth is plummeted to nothing and i i genuinely wrote a paste bin saying i think i'm done streaming actually we're just saying a lot because i i love it and uh but i didn't i i didn't know if i could go on any further dealing with that crap ever again so michael can you tell me a little bit about what the last few years have been like so let's say 2015 to 2022 well this is where it gets totally different um so i um i get into working out actually it actually started working out until until um until 20 late 2014 like like i don't know it might have been like december or whatever here um and i um i i went full time by 2015. at first i had a full-time sub goal of 400 subs to be able to like you know lower my experiences and live off of that but by 2015 i'd i or by july of 2015 i already surpassed 600 subs and i was like okay well what am i scared of you know i said i would do this 200 subs ago and people are sticking around they they like me um like what i'm doing right now maybe i should stop being scared and like you know make that leap you know i even had this issue actually where i was like scared to quit my job you know and i i even googled here at desperation remember this here i googled uh why am i scared to quit my job and i'd learn here to yeah fear of change fear of habitat and just like it's a huge step for anyone here even if you don't like your job and whatnot um but yeah i went full-time uh july 2015 and um my plan was to like take the next upcoming yoshi game and make it my next big thing and this is big because what happened was mario maker one released september 11 2015. um and i'm sure you've heard of it the game where you like you you make the mario levels and you share it so um that went super viral that went like giga viral and i happen to be the one maybe the one person who like um was speedrunner savvy but also palatable on a mainstream twitch scale because of my my waiter swag and whatnot so i was able to like you know like you know where speed running required you know flow state into interaction here it was like you know i can meld together because it's bite-size mario levels um i played that and i went viral immediately i went from being like a 400 viewer whatever person to like 4 000 instantly and then the next day 6 000 and then the next day 7 000 and then the next day 8 000 and i was a i was an 8 000 viewer person for months like i i didn't know what to do like this success was so viral and so sudden that i i thought every day was gonna be the last days i just like i just kept doing it i would just literally go live and do 18-hour binge-a-thons until i couldn't go any further like i was i tell my roommate yo look 50 bucks i don't know dude here go go to waffle house give yourself something get me three texas roadhouse meals whatever here and we'll uh i'm gonna keep going and so i i just grinded to a pulp kept doing that and um um and that was uh kind of the best and the worst thing there um there are a lot of streamers who are definitely jealous of what i had going on um i know i went viral i was able to take it and retain it and keep going with it here um i felt like i was i had no i felt more alone at that time actually whenever i had that monstrous success like the amount of like i don't know amount of like scam dms and like um you know people pretend to be a girl and trying to like uh or or whatever right trying to um catfish or whatever here you know i'm a big fan i'm a hot grill and you know whatever california whatever dude everything everyone had something to sell me now it was just like i felt like all my all protocols of communication were compromised nothing felt real it felt goes in a simulation there was even a period where like i didn't like uh where i was staying up so late that i was um i was going to bed at 7 00 pm because i had stayed up so late and continues to push my circadian rhythm further and further back that there was actually a three-day period i didn't talk to anybody i hadn't talked with any humans and it was and it was really weird it actually made me like a little disoriented honestly my communication entirely was like virtual and surrogate through a monitor and text for like three days straight that's like a it's a really really weird feeling feels the isolation can be like paralyzing in a way because because like my my my skin became paper thin like you know because i had no nothing to ground myself so my my skin my stakes of like uh critique because remember you gotta think you're right i'm like 8 000 viewers if i if i make like one like xbox joke you know lol xbox has no games here an xbox fanboy is going to call me you know well they get offended or whatever right and then hurts my feelings because i was like i had no basis for how to like deal with that well anyways yeah i was um i became incredibly virally successful and i was not prepared for it and the amount of feedback you get when you like i don't know crack a joke or say something that's like not you know anyone can like you know google food and immediately verify that what you said was wrong or whatever i know it's like a lot of feedback all the time and like if you don't have like enough ego i guess to like endure that it can be pretty draining you know definitely so that that that happened to me a ton and uh so ever since then um of course also here i i miss managed or i would say admittedly i um i wasn't the most disciplined i felt continuously overwhelmed here i had like thousands of dms on my discord i had you know twitter was blowing up and whatnot here i i didn't have like you know you know it's like running an empire like that if you're like not used to it it's uh you crack under what i would say here and i i most certainly did what what does crack mean um i stepped away um so to speak i guess uh how do i put this here so if we well see i'm kind of like i'm dancing around the topic but i guess i should get to the topic here the topic would be that um so if you go back here when i told you about you know when it came to girls that i i i didn't know how to deal with insecurity and even though i was working out and i was getting in better shape i thought that being more physically fit would help me deal with this and i and there was a point where i convinced myself that okay if i get like if i get abs like right if i really build up and i like sculpt and everything here and once i have abs i will i will finally have the confidence i need to finally talk to girls i was actually scared i was scared there were like a lot of like other um you know female content creators and whatnot or whatever here and i just never made a move i never made a move because i was like i was paralyzed by fear i was afraid of rejection i i was afraid that i was afraid of rejection but i also was afraid of like coming off as thirsty i felt like i had to i felt like i always had to be like um like a demigod in a way here i had to like you know i lack genitalia i am i am you know i'm i'm tri-hex the tri-god and i need to be above the surface mortal level of attraction um because this is going to only distract me from what my goals are i don't i don't know where that even comes from here at this point here now maybe maybe that's like a incorrect uh assessment here but can i ask you a couple questions about that sure why do you have to come off as what's help me understand a little bit about not wanting to come across as thirsty i don't know it's terrifying man i don't know like i saw some other streamers who would like you know hit on girls or whatever and and they would get belittled on it on twitter for like haha you horny haha you thirsty or and and maybe it goes back here to yeah it sounds like you're once again playing yu-gi-oh right where it's like if i play this card and i come across as thirsty like that's not gonna go well so i can't and i'm kind of i can't show them vulnerable you know what i mean yeah yeah i don't want to show i don't want to show anyone who follows me on twitter that like i'm um um i'm human and i find attraction possible yeah right yeah like um so uh that comes into play here but i mean um kind of a weird question but do you think you were thirsty um see okay thirsty would be like i'm gonna put that here how would we define thirsty um not a negative way no i don't think i was being unreasonable i also didn't hit anyone though um i was i craved companionship that's what you're asking here yeah yeah i definitely like um found other women attractive and i definitely would have loved to had a girlfriend i had never had a girlfriend at this point i'd i'd been perpetually single forever um i went through some pretty hardships in high school and onward um where i was uh i was a virgin for a lot longer than i thought it would be not again not that being a virgin is an issue here and i hate to make it sexual i'm sorry this is like a a topic you don't talk about whatever you're just like um but but in in high school and again in small town louisiana is just like you know what what always was emphasized here is the body count you know every every weekend i'm hearing these guys you know brag about how many how many girls they ran train on and whilst other like stuff that i had no interest in and they just would like it's really weird imagine you have other like 16 year old boys who are just sitting here burning their entire weekend chronically lying to other girls about how you're the only one oh baby i love you you're my girlfriend and they're all the whole agenda here is to like you know get them in an environment where they can they can like finally persuade them by peer pressure to then partake in sexual acts you know i won't they want to smash and it's just but it's you know they're wasting like hours with like phone calls and and all the other manipulations to be able to maybe get their 15 minutes of frame or whatever yeah michael i i'm wondering if actually like it's interesting right because you're a part of you maybe is afraid of rejection but i'm almost almost kind of envisioning that part of also what you're afraid of is or actually part of what you didn't know back then was that when you express interest that interest comes with all of this toxicity and so you wanted to maybe demonstrate to people that you were interested but like not in a way that is like those other people you know that you were interested in companionship as opposed to smashing yeah yeah definitely that yeah um well it gets it gets worse i um so this is something that i feel like maybe isn't given enough attention here but like uh i was ultimately i was catfished uh twice um and i was devastated that i probably fell for the same person just using an alt you know and you know i got catfished and i got then the rebound was another woman telling me that she's you know she's another member of my community and that's unfortunate that happened here and she wanted to like you know talk to me and help me console me through it here uh and whatnot and and that that was also a catfish and just like at that point i was i was burned so i um i was devastated can you tell me can you tell me what you mean by catfished so by catfish i mean there was a um there was a person who was presenting themselves as what they are not um this was a um someone used pictures of some some pretty like female cosplayer um and i i i thought they were real i thought they were thought they really want to be my friend i i had never had also for context here i i kind of have nev i never had had a friend who was a girl before i um again when i say here like i'm talking like like genuinely like terrified of like miss speaking or or making an idiot myself in front of in front of women so i just i i just kind of put it off forever i felt in comfort around guys because i didn't feel judged but maybe may go back here to some rejections i had in high school where i was told you know uh that they didn't they you know i was a loser and whatnot so the reason i asked about cat fishing is is because i'm still a little bit confused because sometimes when people catfish you know they're there's actually a romantic attraction but they will use fake pictures and things like that to try to advance a relationship almost create like some emotional bond which is kind of manipulative in nature and then when the mask comes off but the person so i've i've heard of two kinds of catfishing one which is you know developing a genuine emotional relationship that's based on a lack or they're genuine or they're real emotions let's call them that way but sort of like false advertisements and a lack of trust at the beginning and then the other kind of catfishing that i've heard about is is really in a sense even more predatory and there's like it's not even a woman there's no romantic interest on the other side you know i've heard of cat fishing is kind of like a fear of rejection which is why i i false advertise but i really am attracted to you or something like that and i've also heard of like catfishing as a way to like screw people out of money you know and and so which one are we talking about with you if that makes sense um the n1 resources or anything like that here they were just um they were they would never want to so they they present some pictures right um i'm a big fan uh whatever here maybe we should hang out at this coming convention and whatnot here it's kind of just like a you know whatever like a nonchalant opener and then from there it was like okay well do you want to and they were advancing a little bit you're showing signs that you know i find you attractive and whatnot which was very validating to me here it's like this is the first time i've ever heard from a woman that oh i find you attractive i had never had i hadn't happened yet and so um but every time we would try to push for you know a phone call or like a video call or just like any kind of like you know tangibles it just it was always like oh i'm busy and what you know the usual the deflection and whatnot and that just happened for like almost three weeks and it was exhausting because i i wanted to believe so bad um that okay maybe this maybe this is the time maybe i actually maybe i am lovable maybe you know maybe now you know now that i'm in twitch land and i'm a validated speed runner and a successful streamer maybe now all that garbage from high school was just like you know a phase michael has become trihex yeah yeah except that it wasn't of course it was a catfish of course it wasn't real and then just i got devastated and i just like i tuned out i i stopped streaming for like i don't know like i don't know like almost half a month honestly which is like a death sentence at the time to keep momentum up here so like my view count plummeted from like 8k to like 2k because then at that point everyone was very eager to like pick up my my momentum from the from dominating the mario maker directory so yeah that that dominance diminished considerably when i came back at that point even then when i came back it was because i was streamer guilt i was i was so overwhelmingly felt guilty about not streaming here from my you know uh loving community and whatnot because they didn't do anything this is nothing to do with them it's just one person then i have bad judgment and whatnot but yeah that that uh that catfish definitely like really messed me up well michael it sounds like you've had a lot of unfortunate experiences a lot of struggles over the years imposter syndrome discrimination people sort of taking advantage of emotional vulnerabilities almost i mean hopefully this isn't is okay to say but almost naivete you know that that you were naive um and you were looking for companionship and someone sort of sniffed that out and kind of took advantage of it once and then it sounds like they like the the traumatic first experience then made you emotionally vulnerable to it happening again yeah that that was yeah correct yeah i got i got i got a catfished again and um and that one was even though this one i don't know of the same person or not i just like and here's the real issue the real issue is that you don't get closure like even if you like accuse them like hey look i have definitive proof here that you are not who you're claiming to be you're not being transparent right now all that happens is it's gonna just obfuscate that with more lies like there's gonna they're going to min max on plausible deniability further and further and further and use every out they have because how hard can you really put them down you know so it's just like you you you so badly all this time invested you just it all feels transactional and you feel objectified or and whatever else it may be here and it's like you can't even like seek closure you have to just conclude on your own that this is like i'm i'm done being on this merry-go-round of like a psychopath time sink and you just get off of it i'm sorry if i had to go i just appreciated the phrase min max plausible deniability which i've never heard before but it's it's brilliant uh yeah i don't know maybe that's uh no i mean i i think you've got away with words dude it's great right and and you're spot on that i think it's it's hard right because with some of these relationships even when you know the truth you never get an admission you never and you're so like no matter what happens you know it's almost like the more you suspect and the more you try to get closure the more smoke screen comes up and yeah and so like you're really looking for it right you're looking for some kind of tangibility you're looking for some kind of like admission of guilt you're looking for some kind of acknowledgement for what you've been through but the more you reach for that the more you know intangible it becomes yeah so so yeah i mean so so michael i noticed we've been talking for a little while is there something in particular that um you think we haven't touched on yet or something that um you kind of want to talk about or potentially struggling with well um i've got more questions but i just want to give you a chance to oh uh well um i'd say the the the most uh recent thing that i i've been really like uh doing better on here is probably uh productivity struggles and uh ever heard of this phrase um unconquerable task syndrome mm-hmm did i ever come like a i don't even know if it's a if it's a real like thing or not here i just saw it in an article one day and i was like this this feels like what i'm dealing with right now there was there was been like a long period where like um so particularly it comes from burnout um i've been burned out but didn't know i was burned out and then i had productivity struggles because i was burned out but wasn't aware of it or in denial of it and then finally whenever i would like you know stream for i don't know six days or whatever straight and i feel like i needed to like really really get down to some like communication you know reply some emails um do some community management tasks manage my discord etc here you know run the empire so to speak um i just couldn't do it like the matter i would sit there and just stare at my monitor and just be like bro i am i can i can give it like 20 minutes of focus time and i'm just like totally drained and i'm like bro i cannot why am i so unproductive here and my my go-to gut reaction was the fact that um maybe have adhd maybe i maybe i need like adderall or ritalin or something maybe i like i need to i need to go i need to be 100 today because i'm so behind in everything here i gotta i gotta stream you know i try to stream you know um eight hours a day try to do at least five days a week usually doing six days a week here you know i try to shove like i don't know like 80 hours worth of stuff in a 40 hour work week on my end here and get some other stuff done and just like um and i just felt like i couldn't i couldn't get it and and the guilt the guilt felt overwhelming honestly and that was uh that was really uh dragging me down for years because i'm just like how do these other streamers do it i'm continuously comparing to them and i'm looking how sensible they are i'm just like people who came after me who came after me you know i feel like by being a twitch boomer i'm i'm i'm i'm the one here who's stagnant because they're the ones who are able to like see more objectively maybe here comparatively like how what the new meta is and what not and i don't i don't see it i don't know because that's something i've been struggling with recently here but um can you tell me about unconquerable task syndrome so it's just like whenever whenever there's a task to take care of here like like you need to for example let's say you want to zero uh you want to zero out your inbox you have like 100 unread emails just want to kind of go through there and you want to get in there file them by you know whether it's a receipt purchase or whatever here and kind of get it knocked out right you can do like i find what happens i want to like make it like a smaller incremental step process you know okay let's let's let's let's categorize 100 emails first then skim them for anything valuable then you know delegate them to where they got to go and whatnot and i'll have fun like taking like a dry erase board just like you know writing all like the planning of the task is fun executing the task is where i'm like i'm stuck and i'm like and then i end up like i don't know like i whether or no how you unconquer it is different on each person here but for me i end up like spazzing out and going in different things here like in the 100 email inbox end up like seeing here an email from like i don't know whatever like hellofresh or whatever and i'm like and i'll go over that website and just look at that and you know oh this looks cool here and just i can't focus i just i'm so my attention span is already at like 99 consumed so like i i don't have much left to really give here because i don't really want to be doing this right now i i want to just like i can't get there i feel this overwhelming need to do the task but i just cannot simply execute on the focus of it planning it is fun but doing it is like just i'm unable to do it and have you made profit and i feel i feel i feel very very guilty i'm just like bro i i sit here in front of the computer just like for like an hour and a half it's like okay i give up i'm gonna go for a walk and come back and figure it out here and it ends up being here it's like i'll spend like a whole like nine hours on my day off and i'll have gotten that one thing done a hundred emails filed and then so you do you do do it at a slug's pace yes at a depressingly slow pace with a lot of breaks in between yeah and michael is it okay i mean we could talk about this for the next you know 15 20 30 minutes if that's okay with you and try to understand what's going on um sure well one it's it's gotten a lot better now i will i will say here this is like what i've recently been dealing with here but i'm happy to report i'm doing a lot better yeah so help us understand how did it get better um i did the unprecedented so i've been full-time streaming on twitch since july 2015. i had i've i was scared genuinely scared to take a break i never took breaks even going to evo going to twitchcon going to other events always was like a cross-pollination of opportunity i wouldn't really call it off the grid i didn't even know really what a real vacation was i i i've never i was a gamestop employee into a waiter into this so i've never like i've never had like a job with the security and luxury of actually having like you know pto um paid time off et cetera so i i i wouldn't know i i i was blessed on you know i i know that warrior right now is incredibly privileged being a you know whatever top zero zero one percent twitch streamer content creator whatever here so i know that my job is something that's you know incredibly envied so i have i feel like i have very little room to actually like complain about what i do or you know or or vent about you know what i go through me me me but i've never had a vacation in that regard so i didn't even know what like what like an actual the actual objective of a vacation being rejuvenative i had never entertained that i was always just like okay well i went to you know i went to twitchcon that was that was fun play work whatever here and i come back i keep going here so um but yeah i took um for the first time ever may of this year may 2022 i took an entire month off i didn't plan to i was gonna do two weeks off but i i i realized here that okay i'm actually really burned out let me just take two weeks obviously what happens here and even then i was scared to even admit that it took me until like may 13th like after not being live for like 10 days to finally admit yo i gotta i gotta i gotta keep going here i gotta heal like i can see i need to i need a detox i'm terminally online and i and i'm i've been working for so long here i feel uncreative i come live and it's just because it's the routine the motions but i don't really know what i'm doing anymore that whole month off is what led to me um finally really seeing at the core of what was going on there um and and it seems like taking a break really helped you with some of this this unconquerable task stuff yeah yeah because i was able to finally like so i i find for example here i'm not really able to reflect on how i'm doing until i'm away from that this environment so i'm in my office that i'm in whatever 80 hours we go over here and can i really reflect on how to improve my workflow my tasking and uh and everything in between here when there's always the looming um threat of the access to streaming you know if i'm if i'm only getting like one task done in a nine hour span or i could just go live and stream today and at least get eight hours knocked out there which one am i to do so that's usually what ends up happening i say okay so i feel incredibly guilty and even more defeated on the fact that i could have just streamed so until i get away from this office of turmoil i found i wasn't really able to reflect so once i did that and went away i was able to think okay okay well that what is a what is in theory what is the structure of a of a productive trihex day on a day on on a day off you know how do i make gym and fitness synergize rather than like antagonize yeah well uh the flow of streaming and so what i'm kind of hearing you say is that and this is really common by the way that we have if we have easy ways of being productive and there are sometimes tasks that we struggle with that in theory should be take a small amount of time but what we always end up doing is i think you beautifully said it beautifully that i could waste nine hours doing one hour of work or i could do the eight hours of work that's easier for me to do and at the end of the day i can have done eight hours of work or one hour of work and so what ends up happening is because our our you know our brain is knows how to do particular things what we end up doing is we choose the same easy work thereby being more efficient and we never actually get around to the quote-unquote hard work which is going to be less efficient and and you just can't justify the cost to yourself right of taking a break from streaming like okay like i can stream for a day or i can take a day off which also i wonder a little bit about you know if this goes back to even a case of the don't wants or being idle forever right because like you're saying you've never taken a break and it sounds like early on you were you know taught like hey no gap years like gap years isn't something that people like us do vacation isn't something that people like us do you know i do admit it took me a long time to be to me that the desire for vacation is not weakness um i can tell when i was talking to other people on a subconscious level i would associate vacation and recreation as weakness i don't know if that maybe that comes from being a waiter where it's gig economy and being a waiter was one of the very few jobs that access to when i was 18 years old that like let me make money and more of it proportional to my effort you know i found many jobs you're paid in the amount and usually you can get the work done in like i don't know half the time but you're not really paid more to get it done half time so you just kind of end up padding the work ultimately your time is indirectly being perceived as like worthless because you're not being rewarded for being more efficient you're just rewarded for right you know typical stuff right so maybe being awaited for so long is kind of what reinforced to me just like hustle mentality of just like well or really i'm gonna say hustle because that's not the right that's a lot it's like a loaded turn these days here but more like make the most of what you got you know never um yeah never never idle maximize your potential is that that way i'd put it here yeah so um michael let me ask you a couple questions or actually can i just share a couple of thoughts that i thought you know you've shared that are really interesting absolutely um so the first thing that i want to kind of say is that it sounds like you've really been on a journey for a while and that there were you know things that you can be proud of and in areas that you really struggled what i'm really hearing is from being you know a young kid who liked nerdy things before nerdy things were cool to you know the passion of yu-gi-oh which which still traumatizes you to this day um and we haven't opened the can of worms of why you don't like yu-gi-oh now which i heard you say you know it's a completely different reason um and then you know becoming a speed runner becoming a streamer uh transitioning to full-time always juggling so many balls and i i think what what really is remarkable about hearing your story is the way that you capture moments of difficulty so this overthinking pyramid of confusion you know can't afford a case of the don't wants min maxing plausibility struggling to believe in yourself struggling to find inner peace perceiving you know you're not good in your own head you feel guilty for wanting to take a break there's so much about what you've said even some of the stuff in terms of romance in terms of like you know wanting a companion but being growing up in frankly kind of a misogynistic environment where like you were afraid of being perceived in a negative light right because that's when you were growing up the people who said that were being disingenuous but if you genuinely want a connection like how can you share that with someone without signaling to them oh i'm i'm thirsty and there's just so much stuff that you've kind of gone through even feeling alone when you're kind of like successful i mean there's so much that you've gone through that i think people actually like a lot of people in our community struggle with whether it's imposter syndrome whether it's burnout whether it's this unconquerable task issue of like there's some work that's very easy for me to do and it's just so hard for me to do other things what what would you share with people who have resonated with a piece of your story like how did you what would you what would you say to them or any advice that you have for them about if they're yeah well first i want to say uh you you blow me away just now when you when you tied the uh the the the negative connotation of being thirsty or even uh seeking companionship with like tying it back to the misogynistic uh high school boys i had never thought about that actually i had never thought here that maybe i maybe that's where my association bias came into play that that's brilliant i never even thought about that uh thank you for that yeah of course um the uh my my what advice would i give if people are resonating with what we're saying right now would be um again i really do think here uh i i do believe that happiness is like being more self-aware so like perhaps like understanding what you're feeling will help you be able to figure out uh why you're feeling what you're feeling that's kind of a broad thing i don't even mean stuff on your toes there what not but i i usually use that so and what that means is you gotta reflect more often you gotta like i found the days to be much more manageable so okay before here it's like i feel like i would wake up and i'm already like this high in in quicksand or water like i'm like it's like it's eight it's 8 a.m and i'm already about to like fall apart i'm like where do i even begin i got you i'm i'm walking around the house doing the pacing just like or like the the the football shake maneuver or whatever it's called here the juking and i'm just like what are we i don't know where to go like i need to be live in two hours and i can get into like i need to like eat gym shower like my day's already failed my day's already failed and i find that if you're if you're going through that feeling of like what feels like damn near suffocation you got to slow it down and you have to be able to reflect on and idealize here what is my ideal day and like what what do i like what is priority here because you're putting time somewhere anywhere everywhere but there is definitely a priority of what's being of what's allocating your time and whatnot so how important is it to you to like figure out like um what you want to get in control of i find it once i started getting in control of my day it got a lot a lot lot better okay so it sounds like being more aware really sort of thinking about prioritization organization yeah yeah you know and being able to reflect will mean that you acknowledge or maybe perhaps you have like you're trying to shove 30 hours of stuff in a 24-hour day and and theory you can do this if you're operating at 140 non-stop here but can you but but can you really sustain working at 140 percent for 18 hours straight of or 16 hours straight of being awake here probably not so you need to like you know and and and what happens is like i did think that and therefore i always would attack myself my own critiques of not being able to do the 140 workload daily every day all day no breaks continuously and then you know you enter a chain of self-loathing and then i just feel like they also combine that with like you know whatever metrics driven workload you have here so you know i'm seeing sub count view count you know whatever it is in our streamer space and what not that you that you look at and it's like it's all declining and i feel like i'm failing i'm failing and i don't know how to stop failing so i feel like i'm i feel like i'm broken i feel like i just this wasn't a problem before and it is now i don't even know how to fix it that sounds very relatable and also terrifying this sort of sense that you start to fail you can feel yourself failing you can see yourself failing you don't know how you got here it feels like success is kind of far away it feels like you know you get almost it's like the rug gets pulled out from under you and you're kind of spinning and you don't know how to find stability in those moments good way to put it here yeah you you feel like you're not in control so uh yeah michael let me ask you i i've had a tickling question in the back of my mind and and you know we don't have to talk about this if it's uh uncomfortable for you but we've talked about the challenges you've had in relationships i'm a little bit curious you also hinted that you hadn't had a relationship at that point how i mean have you managed to kind of find healthy relationships like romantic relationships over time or you know i did while while the catfish and all that was the bad news i'm happy to report here that uh me and my wonderful girlfriend got together uh november of 2015 and we've been together since wow yeah we have uh we've been together um me and jessica we've been together since like i don't know like seven years now onward yeah she's great she's my rock she's definitely like the best biggest positive change i've had since i can't even recall when my best friend and then summon all that can you is it okay if i ask a couple questions about the relationship sure yeah how did y'all get together well it's actually kind of funny so um what happened was i was playing mario maker one day and actually i want to say particularly it was a day that like i was frustrated with like maybe the catfish or whatever i don't even know um i was really really mad about something here and i was particularly distant that day while playing mario maker and people can tell i was visibly distraught i didn't feel like streaming this day but i thought i had to kind of push through and do anyway this is like one of those days in november of 2015 where i was like i was already gone for 10 days but i came back because of overwhelming amount of guilt and just kind of like just bitter right just like not my usual like charismatic self here which you got which by the way here again it's really tough with streaming because like you know i feel like for me and you when we go live it's like the whole the bottom fifty percent of emotions are it's not an option you get you need to like you just get there you know if me and you were if you were like a line cook you know your emotional status on being a cook wouldn't affect the food output right you don't have to interact with any other than your fellow line mates and your and your head chef or whatever here but with streaming it's like if i come here like pre-tilted pre-salty pre-aggravated pre-annoyed the fuse is a lot smaller there so i may end up becoming more argumentive or defensive or excessive or you know you know how this whole thing works right so yeah this clearly i was not in the best date here and um she saw that i was upset and she she donated um using her her tag black anti-venom but you know i i didn't i didn't know how to read it because it wasn't capitalized correctly or whatever so i i saw a black ant black gift i've been being a spider-man reference that was actually pretty cool um but i saw that it was black and donating and i i thought it was like some i remember reacting saying here that it was a okay okay uh because they were they were saying something that's kind of affectionate or whatever and um i was like okay thank you you basement dwelling neckbeard i don't i don't care whatever i actually snapped at the donation honestly which is pretty pretty rude of me i will admit now my proudest moment here but then my chat they searched because i said black ants i didn't even give any thought here what the whole whole name was it was um they searched her name saw she had an instagram saw she had a twitch on her instagram so she actually twitch streamed and they were like and my discord was like yo yo yo he's real bro and she's cute you gotta check her out bro so i like you know and i i panicked here because they were all like berating her and telling her you know that that's not usually trihex he doesn't usually do that kind of thing he's sorry about that they were apologizing for me for which i didn't even know they were even doing so then i had so i felt like i had to then like you know reach out to her and tell her i'm sorry if my commute has been like berating you or whatever and then uh and then from there we started talking um the ice was already broken you know the hardest part the part where actually i initiate the whole like i think you're i think you're cute maybe we should hang out sometimes something like that that already happened because twitch wait so let me let me understand this properly michael so this relationship the rock of your life that you've been in for seven years started off by you calling your girlfriend of seven years a neckbeard a basement dwelling neckbeard yes and then and then just to be clear you use the word berate but it sounds like actually your twitch community went to bat for you and did damage control with her they they did but i didn't know the time here i i just they were they were like i didn't if they were mass harassing her or what i didn't know i didn't know exactly uh what was going on so just to be clear okay and maybe i'm simplifying things but you called your girlfriend a neckbeard and then twitch went and did damage control and you all have been seven this is the largest contribution i've ever heard of honestly that's not an exaggeration from twitch chat yeah no they they they found out she's a real person said hey dumbass stop stop treating her this way she's legit yeah and then we're also like hey he's not usually like this give our bro a chance it is true because i no i didn't tell them i had got double catfished at the time here yeah of course um right yeah but i just like i'm like okay yeah you're being affectionate or whatever here maybe i don't i don't know i i didn't i didn't believe what i had lost humanity i was so bitter at that point i was on some like toby maguire spider-man three vibes i was just like you know edge i was edgy at that point i was like bro i'm so over human at this point that that's gotta be the best how we met story i've i've ever heard yeah actually i wanna say it's a highlight i got it it's you know highest i've never leave it on twitch i think it's like buried in there somewhere after i have to find it for y'all one day but yeah it's it's it's somewhere in there yeah but yeah we've been yeah i mean we've been together ever since we did we did long distance for about nine months and then um she wanted to move down to louisiana she liked what she saw and uh we've been together right she did yeah yeah she uh dude i'm i'm a i'm a charismatic playboy i went all out man i was like i had when she would come it was like when we were a long distance she'd come for like she should get three days off of work she would have like 72 hours or whatever they should go fly back sunday evening i had everything planned out and i was like yeah we're gonna go to this park we're gonna go do this thing we're gonna go i'm gonna tell you this restaurant here like i was just like it's like 10 years of romantic angst all like jam packed into nine months of long distance like i was just like i want to show you the world like i'm a lad and you're jasmine this is my carpet i want to like i've never had someone to like just like share your love share my world with yeah share my world with yeah that sounds beautiful dude thank you yeah um and and i and i've and i've learned a lot too i've gone through a lot of things you know having to like really balance trihex and then michael the boyfriend that's been like a another task um that's been a whole other beast i've had i realized i did something pretty uh remarkable because once people found out that like me and uh me and jessica got together and we were long distance for a while i had others who were who were doing we were like hey i got someone here i'm i i've been thinking about entering ldr i see that you and you and her made it work y'all successfully united together in person how'd you do it so i've had people actually you know reach out for it for an effort of advice on on how do you crack the what's the secret sauce what's the weapon next how'd you do it and uh which made me feel pretty means that what i did was pretty remarkable actually because i feel like a lot of ldr can just like linger in the perpetual bit of crap um whether it be insecurities or not or not being transparent enough here and all that stuff there which i don't wanna i don't know if i'm gonna drown that now but just like yeah i mean can you give me like a five minute rundown of of what you think was very helpful in your ldr and and sort of helping it survive long enough to make it no longer long distance sure i so i i i told her in the very beginning here i'm like hey look all right i feel like our main objective should be me objective here i'm making armaments on game game lingo sure our main objective uh needs to be conquering distance like if we are serious here then we need to establish trust at the very beginning unaccountable transparency and that any insecurity you feel about me feel free to hit me up about it i i feel no animosity or shame if you feel the need to bring something up here right now because i feel like an ldr what will happen here is like your smallest insecurity about something will feed and erode our trust and i feel like the strongest things we have right now in our in our the pills of our the pillows of our foundation are going to be communication and trust so hit me up with anything you got here whatever whatever you want to know whatever you need to know i'm i'm i'm i'm more than willing to to get that to you so above everything i want this to work i don't want any you know at the time here i was taking care of you know because i'm a streamer prolific streamer and she's her maybe it would be like you know it would be like haters who are coming in and gonna throw everything they can at her about me that maybe i've said out of context in the past here or something like that i don't know i didn't even know what i was getting into honestly i didn't know what the you know it's like it's like it's like having known unknowns like i know what i don't know versus unknown unknown yeah i don't know but i don't know and this was like a crap ton of unknown unknowns so i was just like hit me up here so we we we did that we stopped at very beginning early on and um our goal was to conquer distance you know figure out here am i moving to where you are moving to where i am or what are we going to do it was like you know what's our student's point we're going to do this here i feel like we need to see each other more often because i don't know if i can do this whole like i don't know i can do this whole thing here we just linger for like six months at a time so like you know maybe can we can we see each other once every six weeks is that manageable for your boss and whatnot and we try to figure out you know when that was i mean we were constantly communicating on the next step everything was methodical and planned and um when it came down to it the the one people can debatably hear say that you know moving in from ldr after nine months is kind of fast but we had prepared continuously the whole time through and it was my top priority i'd say much more than streaming for the first time ever actually this was like a way bigger to me than streaming was so i was you know i would pretty much stream and do like a little six hour stream you know not the trihex tier eight hour stream and then i'd be on the phone with her like four hours after like i could not wait to talk to her honestly you know i was like okay stream's done i'm gone all right you know hey what's up babe what's up babe so um but what the catalyst was that you know um her lease was gonna renew on her apartment and i felt like i uh and it was like you know either another nine months onward of more ldr or drop the lease and make the move happen now so i was like what do you want to do and she was like let's do it now on that note i chose deliberately to um fly to her and then rent a van and then drive it back down that way the transition from her state to louisiana was like more gradual i felt like her flying here would have been like a really abrupt thing and i wanted to make a memory out of the transition so even though it was actually more expensive i chose to drive back with her and make it more of a memory yeah i mean i i'm noticing michael a couple things the first is that it sounds like you y'all have both been quite thoughtful and intentional about how you manage this relationship um the second thing that i i notice and it's kind of bizarre because i've seen this time and time and time again that oftentimes the healthiest relationships that i've encountered over the course of my career my life are usually like pretty idiotic in some way i i i mean that honestly like because like i i'm not it's not a judgment it's just like the the best relationships usually have something that honestly would be like okay moving straight from a long distance relationship to moving in after nine months seems fast right a lot of people would say like oh that's actually like a relationship mistake that's you know and and there's some there's something honestly there's something stupid about love like in a good way you are not wrong the logic center is like i think i'm a pretty logical person i was the honeymoon phase i was like on another world yeah i couldn't even explain it that's crazy and i i've seen that i mean i certainly know in in my relationship for example like you know my person is now my wife should have really should have dumped me like for a couple years like because i wasn't doing nothing you know i was like kind of complete just not going anywhere or doing anything and she just she really and she was crushing it in life and and she really should have traded up you know imo but and and so we you know we have we've had our fair share of idiocy in in our relationship too but i kind of see that and i think it's like yeah so thank you so much for sharing absolutely any questions for me before we we sort of think about wrapping up um questions for you um i guess here's let me think here um the one i could think of here that uh maybe you could could help me understand here is like i i think i'm coming the terms now with like what i'm calling here streamer guilt um have you ever found it an easier way to like balance that like i usually find when i if i feel guilty about like i'm not doing enough for my okay the thing here is i always feel like i'm not worthy of the community i have i have a bunch of loving people who have been around some of them you know 100 month plus subs and it's kind of insane it's kind of like daunting even think here that you've been around like the amount of roller coasters i've been through with like just like not figuring out myself and whatnot and they've been around for 100 plus months is like insane to me how do you ever come to terms with like you know i i've i'm not i don't know i'm not you're fulfilled with how you're performing as a streamer does that make that success yeah yeah so so let me just unpack that a little bit so you mentioned streamer guilt uh can you tell me a little bit about that i feel i feel like i've never made like the con the peak form content that my community deserves i feel like it's like a if they're thirsty i've never quenched their thirst in terms of like maybe i have to them but i haven't to me okay so i feel i feel guilty about that especially when i take off like days and stuff to like i still feel guilty about taking days off and i'm trying to currently adhere to like a some kind of like you know five days on two days off per week kind of thing just just so i can have a better work-life balance i've seen here what that does to my mental if i don't do that but i still feel guilty what do you do with that guilt um i uh good question i don't i don't internalize it i mean do you like distract yourself do you like do you think it's legitimate do you try to process it do you talk it through with your girlfriend like where does it go yeah sometimes i'll talk with my girlfriend about and go walk our dog daily and it will like usually um i don't i don't know that's a good question actually i need to think that one more honestly i just know that i feel um i know that once i once i got subscriber right once i got like once i have like a a paying patronage that happened here the everything changed like july 2013 when i got a partner and like it was at that point here that i never like taking a day off previously before the subscribers existed it felt i could make taking a day off be constructive whereas now i feel like taking days off is usually it feels more destructive i always feel like i i should be doing more or something like i have to like learn to enjoy the downtime and being idle and not like always need to do more here because i feel like all my competition is always live and they're always doing something they're always outdoing me yeah but then again maybe also i also work out so maybe it's a whole different thing because i feel like i i need more recovery and whatnot i don't know it's hard hard to say okay like how do you how do you come with peace of just like not like how do you come with peace on not always being on i guess maybe great so i'm so my answer for you michael is going to be a little bit different oddly enough i i feel like i do have an answer so take that with a grain of salt right but here here's what i see in you so the first thing is that i'm going to take a slightly more spiritual perspective if that's okay as opposed to psychological sure so michael you've got a voice in you that calls you to do more do better okay okay i think if you want to do right by your community that's a good thing i think what could be going on sometimes what happens is when we have a spiritual voice within us our psychological hang ups or complexes will hijack and twist what is a good intention into a negative result so what i what i think is going on here is if you have gratitude for example and you want to make content for your community and that's what drives you to be a streamer that's actually a healthy thing and for you to say you know for their to be a part of you to say i haven't done what i set out to do i have not done what i'm on this earth to do that's actually like i think that's a healthy voice so some people may say like oh you know like kind of get rid of the guilt like acknowledge be grateful like you know this is all but i think actually what's kind of going on here is i'm noticing a parallel between you know michael and try hex and becoming number one in the world setting a standard for yourself that until you reach that standard you're not going to be satisfied and so there's something going on here where i i think what's actually happening is there's a genuine desire to create content and do right by your community which i actually think you should lean into i think that's what's going to actually make you the best content creator the challenge is going to be that for some reason you're not letting yourself be patient in that accomplishment yeah yeah right so so this is the kind of thing we're doing right by your community is not something that you need to do in six months it's not something you need to do in nine months or 12 months this is like i mean you've been you're a boomer streamer let's say but like you're not done right like content creation is going to continue this community people have been subbing for 100 months there's gonna be a hundred more especially i think you're sort of like an old soul and you can kind of offer a lot of guidance to people in this community even sharing your stories of your like your romantic relationship and things like that the reason that we have these kinds of conversations is because i can guarantee you that even today there's a black kid who's in a small rural town who's playing you know like whatever kids play nowaday and they're terrified that girls are not going to like them because of you know the way that their hair is and there's no like barber that knows how to handle their hair so they just get crappy haircuts um i recently saw a study that actually like a a remarkable number of african or african-american children face bullying and discrimination specifically due to their hair like more than 50 and we as a society actually don't know how to like handle like most places that will cut hair don't know actually how to handle hair from particular ethnicities and there's like like psychological studies that have been done on this and so this is the kind of thing where i i encourage you to do right by your community but also be a little bit careful about i think what's getting in the way is your ego that recognize that you doing right by your community doesn't have to do with you it's not actually about you and whether you it's like it's really about service right so and this is where like i'd encourage you to like take a step back and sort of acknowledge that this is a this is a main quest it's a long-term quest and that this is like a long haul that you don't have to fix everything right now and think a little bit about the part of you that is fundamentally unsatisfied because i'm hearing a theme throughout your life that you've been unsatisfied with your performance at times there's always been guilt there's always been burnout there's always been like you know i can't take a break there's all kinds of things about a case of the don't wants and being idle forever which i think like insert themselves into your thinking even to this day yeah maybe so this is the kind of thing where i would really encourage you to not to try to do right by your community but oddly enough acknowledge that you may never be able to and that that's actually okay because i think it's that last part that you know you can yo like and eve i don't know if this kind of makes sense but even when we talk about you grinding away at yoshi's island at the age of like 16 or whatever you know recording things on vhs that that was about you giving it your all the flow state really isn't about accomplishing it's really about being fully present in the moment and giving it your all and i think the more that you can acknowledge that what your community deserves from you is not a particular outcome but that you offer them what you can right try hex with all of his growth all of his xp and all of his flaws can't necessarily fix your community but what you owe them these people who are actually a little bit responsible for the relationship that you're in now right that you should try to give back is service and i think the more that you can and because this is the key thing is is stepping away from our ego which is what gives us guilt because this is kind of where i know it's what i'm saying is sort of abstract so let me try to explain you can't be guilty unless you have a sense of self right if i say oh i'll look like let's say like let's take this conversation so i feel guilty in this conversation because i haven't helped you enough but that i can't feel guilty for that unless i have an expectation of how much i should be able to help you i see and that comes from my identity that i'm dr k and i should be able to help oh my god i didn't live up to what dr k is capable of and then i feel guilty whereas you know so the way that i kind of handle that is to show up and acknowledge that actually dr k ain't right like i actually have no idea if i can help you or not help you all i know is that i'm going to show up and i'm going to give whatever i have to offer and for some people it may be enough and for other people it won't be enough and in the same way are you on this earth to support this community that has given you so much 100 so you're going to give them what you have to offer is it going to be enough is it not going to be enough is trihax enough is michael enough like it's not your place to to give them enough it's only your place to give them what you have i see how does that sound to you you you you nailed it when you said um second to last point you said right there about the um about like i i have to i have to win i have to give it like i have to have to accomplish the thing here it was kind of like what resonated with like it was like a is it a fault of the effort or was it a fault of the pre-calibrated expectation or even the entitlement of what you know i i need to get to this point even if even if it asks for 140 effort yeah so yeah i think if we look at it psychologically there's actually research that shows it's a pre-calibrated expectation so if you actually look at the science of entering the flow state which leads to optimal performance stepping away from expectation is one of the key prerequisites of entering the flow state wow okay that's a i got homework to do then i didn't even know that yeah so it's really interesting and i think those expectations in turn have to do with ego right because how do you set expectations they have to do with okay what is trihex capable of and and you know you're bringing up a really good point because uh oh this is the the bad thing is that i've definitely stigmatized emotions a ton i've i've remember seeing myself a ton at the worst of my pit of that has been how salty until tilted i've gotten has been why must i get salty and annoyed why can't i be the emotionless robot and just play perfect and just why can't i just grind practice gain xp and just be perfect in six months why must why must these emotions hold me down from being able to just grind and get the and get get the results yeah so i dreaded the process so i try hex let me just like let's understand that so what are you doing in that moment you're moving away from the person that you are because emotions are a part of you and you're human right and you're beating yourself up for being a human and not living up to the expectation of what you have in your mind yeah you have this idea of trihex and then here's michael and it goes back to like my first question what do you go by yeah i actually thought about that earlier i was like wait what do you ask the tag thing i i couldn't even answer that one like like like i couldn't even give you an ugly answer i had to give you the or i couldn't give you a pretty answer to the ugly truth yeah i'm like right complicated so so i think at the end of the day you are you're not trihex you're michael right like you are this person who's flawed who has negative emotions who has guilt who can sometimes only do one hour of work in in nine hours and the truth of it is that's okay your guilt actually comes from not what you owe them but what you expect from yourself right you're you're letting yourself down because you're not living up to that expectation i'm not hearing your community complaining no they they're they're homies right yeah they're they and so this is all coming from you and coming from what you expect from yourself and this is where i'm not saying don't give everything you've got and this is a medicine frankly like i mean this is a lesson i frankly learned in medicine not in india when i was like studying to become a monk but like what you realize as a doctor is that you can't save a life you can try you know but like you can try yeah you can you can try but you can't uh yeah that's all you can but what more can you do right you can't with juan yep beyond your own strength beyond your own willpower i can give it a 100 and the more that i get caught up and oh my god i'm a brilliant doctor and i should be able to do more that actually doesn't help the patient that's all about your ego right does that make sense i should be able to help this person more it's like i'm not even thinking about them i'm thinking about my own shortcomings i think about like a veterinarian and if if the if the critter dies on their watch and how they can't get over that they didn't they didn't win win every single time right sometimes it's just going to be like that and so the more that you acknowledge your own humanness the more that you acknowledge that you set an impossible standard for yourself and i think that too in terms of your identity like a couple of other things to think about is that that standard that you set is also born out of your insecurity and that's kind of weird but you you were who you were and as people started i don't know how to say this but like as they started treating you as less you create an ego that compensates so you have to be the best because what you were wasn't good enough yeah compensating right yeah and whereas like like it just imagine how your life would be different if people were like you know oh it's like totally fine that you're playing yu-gi-oh if at the library there was like a cute girl who also played yu-gi-oh if people had accepted you early on you would have nothing to prove that desire to prove comes out of the insecurity yeah yeah that's that that makes a lot of sense to me actually and so the more that you feel guilty is because you haven't proven what you have to prove you want to prove to yourself that the community deserves you so you're going to do right by them you're going to save the world but that's all born out of the insecurity that you know they don't deserve you don't deserve them yeah that's the that's what i've been working towards now i i've so you're nailing it all i agree i don't disagree with what you're saying right now um i've been trying to be proactive on it now rather than reactive and so i've i have made a pivot to really doing content that i find fulfilling so i've been wanting to like work on some really abstract stuff some like true blue ocean ideas here rather than just like you know being the super gamer and just playing the game of the week or whatever game of the month i'm okay well what what what are people gonna remember a year from now or five years from now and i thought here uh i wanted to make a fitness guide for gamers you know take the thing i enjoy with fitness and healthy and being and being a huge advocate for it for both lifestyle options and choices and also like you know i've never heard any gamers who are anti-fitness a lot of them are intrigued by it here so i i want to like pioneer that that connection and that has me and i i'm excited and like for the first time in a long time not decay i'm actually like this is an idea that i'm obsessed with and i keep working at it i'm chipping away at this like master google doc i'm working on to get to like version one alpha release and like uh but yeah not to make it about that more it's about you know that yeah the point is actually like i've been working on what really makes me fulfilled so i can stop feeling this guilt actually and i feel like you know that's like the whole thing you know i've had people tell me you know i've lost 60 pounds because of something you said three years ago that really clicked with me on the mental and the accountability and discipline for like fitness and all that and i finally get it now and i'm like maybe there's something here actually so i i i'm getting on the the better path with that i and i really do appreciate everything you said because you're it's crazy i ego insecurities and compensation and the man being the the the the aftermath of what the child goes through in a way here yeah a lot of my teenage hood really is shaping up who i became as an adult and i better worst i think that's it's important to acknowledge that a lot of your adaptations to that have been responsible for your success so the mind does this because it does help right and but at the same time i think like at some point the adaptations that we make to our insecurity like wanting to prove yourself actually leads to you grinding and actually skilling up right so there are advantages to that which is why it's so common for people to do that but at your level michael and usually what we have to do is we have to adapt to some kind of insecurity that adaptation is going to help us for some amount of time and then we actually have to grow past it and what i'm really hearing is that you know this is the tricky thing that you're going to have to face is is you're going to have a crisis or maybe you've already done this you're going to have a crisis of confidence when you have a choice between doing the work that's important and doing the work that makes you successful and then what's wait wait a minute importance versus successful yeah so what i mean by that is that maybe you've already gone through this is at some point this happens with a lot of creators which is what they realize is that like if you make a guide to fitness how is that going to affect your viewership right you're oh right oh okay so yeah so oftentimes what a lot of creators will have to do is like really struggle with that and it's my experience actually that ultimately choosing what's important is the right move because over time that will actually have more impact i can't say that it'll get you more subs sure but when i really think about you know if you if something catastrophic were to happen and and you weren't you never streamed again what people are going to remember or the the effects that you're going to have is that person who lost 60 pounds and now has the confidence to form a relationship gets into a healthy relationship one day has children and then can help those children understand crises of confidence and the ripple effects from what you do that you will never see as a streamer because it's not quantifiable in subs and donations and view count and concurrent viewers and stuff like that that's the real challenge of devoting yourself to a real important ideal and so i'd say lean into it and recognize that the part of you that's obsessed with numbers may have a rough patch but that's where i would also encourage you to use your stream or brain use this person who's grinded use this person who sort of knows how to play the game and and make that import leverage at all towards your important work so play the game but play it for a noble cause i agree that is uh that's that's what i've been wanting to do is exactly that i've been wanting to focus on being fulfilling and not being the a metric obsessed uh meta chaser yeah and rather be the the meta trailblazer you know yeah i like even in your regard i think even healthy gamer entirely if i can flourish for a second here i think this is like amazing honestly um a lot of your uh loving community uh approached me unprovoked uh saying that i'd be a great candidate here and i actually declined it uh or i i i didn't entertain the idea i was in a i was so insecure about even showing any of this here like literally last year that i was like no i would never do that dude not i it seems it's it's daunting it's exhausting i could never actually and yeah i i'm i'm honestly happy to hear you say that michael because i don't want anyone to ever feel pressured to come on here i know that sometimes that happens and that's the way that you know the community is and stuff like that but i think like once again patience right so things are going to happen when they're ready to happen and and most importantly be patient if you're if you have that guilty kind of thought oh i'm not doing enough i'm not doing enough what i'd love for you to do it in that moment is a small cognitive reframe which is like okay my guilt is coming from a genuine place which i want to support and why is it that i expect my perfection for myself at this point why can't i be a little bit more patient with myself and really kind of raise awareness of that i'm gonna actually i'm gonna write that one down that that's i i have to consider that uh patient with myself that's a really good one wow i why am i not why do i feel entitled to instantaneous gratification and success i i don't think it's even a gratification success it's instantaneous service right okay right so why can't you be good enough for these people that you care about and that's okay and and be you know things happened in their time you know you struggled with relationships got catfished a couple times and now you've got your you know long-term healthy relationship if you weren't ready to come on stream last year totally fine and i think the person that you've brought here today it also shares a perspective that's very very helpful for our community i think oftentimes we we sort of talk to people when they're really struggling and it's just as important to see people who have gone through it because that gives hope yeah i i i completely agree with that one there i i i love the idea that you know we're normalizing that you're not alone and that you know everyone has their own struggles and what how how you arrive at them is all you know um uh conditional and loaded in variables here but normalizing that it's okay to not be okay is you know in a way you're not you're not also like getting compounded by uh self-loathing while also failing which is what i was doing like i when i tell you that the the pit of was bad where every day i'd wake up and i feel like i'm already in the quicksand and i'm and i'm panicking and and just again it turns to self-loathing really really bad and that cycle is almost addictive it's like a poison oh yeah so uh michael let me ask you one last question so sometimes when people come on we'll we'll do a brief meditation at the end of the interview are you open to doing something like that sure yeah yeah so i uh i'm not a pro but um i i like to go for walks i like to like actually i find my best uh i have i've tried the conventional and and never had enough guys to really make it work here but i have found that when i physically am away from my office and that's when i can do my best reflection when i'm good furthers from the commitment of streaming but so let's give it a shot let's let me ask you a question is it okay that you're not a pro oh that's a good question um close your eyes because close your eyes i'm gonna ask you the question again i want you to pay attention is it okay that you're not a pro logically yes it's okay what are you feeling the need to perform well right now where is that in your body the need [Music] in my head okay what are you feeling tell me um you feel like a pressure above my head right now just like like i can i feel like i'm i can see and feel the eyeballs looking at me right now okay i want you to know your guys on how to on how to meditate or even how to be in the moment right now straighten your neck in your spine good roll your shoulders just notice that pressure also take a moment to notice the absurdity that obviously you're not a pro at meditation and yet i ask you is it is that okay and you're so impatient with yourself i should have been an expert in meditation already you don't give yourself a moment of like you don't give yourself any slack and now i want you to pay attention to the part of you that doesn't give yourself a break can you find it i see it tell me about it overworked overutilized under-rested strained drained right so it's um so feel like i want you know feel all of those statements in your body like like what does it feel to be overworked over strained um you really want to know yeah um it feels like spongebob in the episode where he's at sandy's house and he's dehydrated beyond reason it's like a totally dehydrated sponge with absolutely no moisture so feel that it's like i want it's like i want to sweat because i'm i'm so drained but i'm incapable of sweating because i'm i'm so nothing left so now what i want you to do is give yourself a drink take a deep breath feel it in your abdomen your chest deep breath in expand pull in air pull in life hold it hold it and out slowly slowly slowly i want you to imagine breathe in again feel the air filling your abdomen your chest even your shoulders it's permeating you with hydration hold it and out slow slow slow slow slow one more time slow deep breath start with the abdomen move to the chest and up the shoulders feel the hydration the life flow into you invigorating each cell in your body you're going to feel that tingling that movement that's life and out now you can resume normal breathing but i want you to listen to my words in this moment notice the part of you that is relentless under-rested always wanting more wants you to be an expert in meditation before you even try be patient acknowledge that that part of you exists for a reason it's not a bad part but that in its quest for perfection you're the one that pays the price i'm going to leave you with one simple concept it's the concept of two arrows this is a concept from kind of buddhist thinking that sometimes life shoots an arrow at us and we take it in the knee we can't control that but often times what we do is take shoot an arrow at ourselves for getting hit by the first one it's not just the mistake it's the self-loathing afterward that's you can't control the pain from the first arrow but then it's the way that we beat ourselves up the way that you don't forgive yourself and the more that you engage in that self-loathing the more that you're not patient with yourself the more that you don't forgive yourself that's what's really squeezing the water out of you so when you feel that way next take a moment to close your eyes spine straight head straight neck straight and breathe in vitality acknowledge that there's a part of you that judges yourself and also acknowledge that you don't have to give in to it that that place is coming from a desperation to prove that you're good enough i'm not a pro at it i need to be a pro at it no you don't you're perfect exactly just notice what you feel in this moment what's wrong with you nothing you exist feel the breath enter your body fill you up feel the strength and the vitality of your form feel this body that you've created through hours of effort this mind that you've honed and refined through years of strategic practice and introspection be proud of the life that you've made acknowledge that you've got a way to go but you have a good amount of time to do it in now put your hands together in namaste position palms together if you you know okay with that from kind of a religious standpoint it's not really religious and i want you to rub your palms together rub them together create friction heat a lot of heat a lot of friction cup them over your eyes cup them over your eyes good take a deep breath in as you exhale slowly open your eyes and then with one more breath let your hands come down and relax i'm a little bit watering wow that was a that was a journey um that was thank you for that that was i what i can say about that having having done that uh well one i don't know why my i don't know why i'm teary-eyed right now jesus um uh time perception that i i couldn't tell you if that was five minutes or three minutes or two minutes i did it was abstract there for a little bit i i was really in that i was i was i your your voice i was just going and i'm just like okay i'm i'm going like good uh that was that was amazing thank you i'm happy to hear that it was a positive experience for you i think it's interesting i don't recommend that people go back and watch the vod immediately after an interview but i think anyone who had their eyes open you can see it in your face michael you could see it it's interesting you know what you you were smiling the whole time yeah i i didn't even know i did i don't know what expression i was making i don't even know where i was like normally you like my eyelids are closed and i'm like looking through the i don't even i don't even know where i was what i was doing or what i was looking at perfect so this is nothing so i don't know how to say this but stepping outside of time is the best way to learn patience stepping outside time which meditation can help do right so that was your experience so this is a good meditation for you so let me give you a couple of instructions so if you want to do this every day you can but when you're feeling impatient with yourself when you're feeling the self-loathing it's not just the mistake that you make it's the way you beat yourself up because in those moments is when you feel the most wrung out right that's why you couldn't do it in the first place and the more you expect of yourself you're squeezing squeezing do more do better do more do better there's not enough time you should have done it yesterday your mind is going to do that take a step back neck straight back straight breathe in vitality start in the abdomen move to the lungs up to the shoulders you're going to feel the physical sensations hold the breath and then let it go slowly step outside of time for a while sit fully with existence no deadlines no time exist outside of time and then like slowly as you practice that you'll learn patience you can do it five to 15 minutes a day you can also incorporate other kinds of meditation techniques you know you can check out we've got like youtube videos and stuff about other meditations um i would also recommend if you want an introductory practice something called alternate nostril breathing or nari shuddi pranayam so you can just google it um okay i'll dm you then the name of the the meditation thank you i almost had al alternate nostril yeah breathing yep yeah so so that can sort of help you kind of develop a formal practice and and i would say do you know somewhere between 5 and 15 minutes a day if you can you can start every other day a week and to get clinical benefits of meditation um in terms of anxiety and stuff like that all the studies basically suggest 20 minutes of practice at a minimum of every other day is usually sufficient for some kind of clinical benefit okay okay great thank you you're very welcome yeah i i will say uh it is reinforcing the very little i know about meditation i've heard here is that like you know i will admit here i'm guilty of this maybe as as recently as like last year had you said you know i think this would benefit you i'd say i don't have time i have too many things to do i don't have time i'm drowning in in debt over like the backlog of tasks i gotta take care of here i i i don't have time and i heard someone i forget where say that like hey if someone tells you they don't have time assign them double the amount of time actually yeah yeah right that's i think the that quote comes from i think the dalai lama i could be misattributing it but someone he said everyone should meditate for an a half an hour a day and if they don't have the time they should meditate for an hour yeah yeah yeah it's and i love it and so uh michael the last thing i'll kind of leave with you thank you so much for sharing that because you said a year ago you would have rejected that so that's why this conversation didn't happen a year ago things happen in their own time when things are ready for it right and if if yeah i'm just thinking about i'll kind of leave this may be like overly interpretive but if yu-gi-oh hadn't released that patch or whatever that set of cards you would have never been a speed runner this is true this is very all right yeah i would have definitely it took a lot of me because i love you i love yu-gi-oh at its peak um and its peak form and what it could have been it took a lot for me to be feel heartbreaking and actually like leave the scene and really like move on to something else yeah so things happen in their own time so be patient with yourself because we wouldn't be having if yu-gi-oh if they'd never if they had balanced things better or whatever like we wouldn't be having this conversation right now so hey that is true wow good luck to you my friend thank you so much and and again i'm a huge fan i think what you use amazing i i could i could uh i could fan girl all day right now i actually did uh i i have consumed a couple episodes of your stuff uh particularly your community was very they're very very righteous i'll just i'll keep it at that they they are they're they're they're best you have an amazing wholesome family and community yeah i wish you nothing but the best we're very grateful for it and and really appreciate you know we really appreciate the community right on so thank you very much awesome all right take care of your money okay you're you're a beast thank you buddy take care all right bye okay so slipped into meditation we had to catch it before uh tri-hex got distracted so wrong way okay let's go this way um yeah so i think a couple of things just to remember so i i really appreciated that interview first of all because tri-x is so passionate and i i want y'all to really take away that if we listen to his story there were a lot of dark periods of his life right super dark periods whether it's be called white mike whether it's a young black kid growing up in rural louisiana loving yu-gi-oh whether it's the people over and was it konami that makes yu-gi-oh you know releasing like there's just so much so much to be in despair about right this game that you love and like honestly like okay two favorite parts of the interview i gotta i mean i i know that we sort of helped out and and talked about stuff and maybe educated people towards the end but two favorite parts of the interview watching him unleash his rant about balance and meta changes in yu-gi-oh from what was it like 21 years ago or something absurd that was awesome and then secondly discovering that the reason he's in his rock of a relationship is because first of all he called his future girlfriend a basement dwelling neck beard and then twitch hat like legit came to the rescue in his community went to bat for him like you can't make this stuff up um that was epic and i like if y'all are despairing i think take solace and inspiration that that trihex made it and even if we're sort of thinking oh my god i'm going to be alone forever like i mean if twitch chat could do it for trihax they could you could do it for yourselves so don't give up hope be patient with yourselves you know i think he's grown so much and it's amazing he's like the dude is an inspiration right and it sounds like he's trying to do you all a solid by putting together this workout doc or whatever like that sounds really cool you know and i think it's like we're sort of seeing this even at the beginning i didn't you know i didn't think about that but we were talking today about camp canutt and how like canada is helping asthma gold and biscuit like put their lives together and get in shape and feel good about themselves and so like this community this world this internet kind of thing that can lead to addiction and despair and and toxicity and and all these kinds of things can also lead to [Music] people getting in shape people finding relationships people understanding themselves better people learning to forgive each other and forgive themselves and it is what we make of it right the biggest scam that we ever pull is convincing ourselves that we don't have power convincing ourselves that we're irrelevant convincing ourselves that we can't change our lives because what the mind does is it looks at all of the reasons why something isn't going to help it's going to say oh it's not enough it's not enough it won't help what difference does it make if i clean my room what difference does it make if i exercise look at all the thousand things that are wrong in the world in my life what difference does exercise make and that's because we're operating from this dimension of time and i know this is going to sound kind of weird like we're going to get into like strange territory but if you want to put together your life stop operating within time start operating in the now don't worry about the future i'm not saying don't consider it entirely right but like in this moment if you decide not to exercise because it's not going to be enough what you're using is you're letting time trick you into paralysis and then today becomes tomorrow and tomorrow becomes the next day and every single day you say it's not enough but what about tomorrow what about this what about this what about this it's all reasons to not act as trihex says it's a case of the don't want us you
