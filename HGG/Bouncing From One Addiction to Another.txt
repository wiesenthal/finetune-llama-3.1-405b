so how do you know if you have an addiction or what is an addiction so when i am addicted to something like alcohol or opiates the physiologic effects on my body are profound our gaba receptors get regulated so heavily that if you have if you're addicted to alcohol and you stop cold turkey the withdrawal that you go through can conceivably be fatal as someone who's done a lot of work in addictions like the main thing that i found is that you can go to aaa you can start this medication you can go to rehab that'll all help but the truth is it doesn't work for everyone right so what's the difference sometimes you'll have people who have a history of trauma who really just want to be loved and when it comes to addictions it's like it's really easy to find someone who you can feel love for if both of y'all are addicted to the same substance [Music] so i've managed to abstain from porn and masturbation but my productivity has lowered significantly and i am impulsive buying uh my impulsive buying came back in full force last time i i posted i was doing so well i exercised steadily not half-assed even though i hate exercise i still managed to do it good job i did my chores did my studies managed to control my impulsive buying to a medium yet manageable level however my porn and masturbation addiction was the one i was stumped before i did another attempt i watched the hubermann podcast with anne lu lumbeck the man likes to inform the general public about neuroscience and ways to use it to our advantage he's quite similar to dr k but highly specialized on neuroscience bro got a degree and more on the science stuff thankfully i'm a first-year nursing student so i can keep up with the anatomical parts and such not gonna lie some of it were way too advanced for me i finished the podcast and gained some insight and learned some tips now to put them to practice i felt huge fluctuations in my mood it made me wonder if this this is how women felt during menstruation on the first day interesting side benefit of empathy maybe food cravings made me spend more than i should exercise has been great difficulty to initiate and finish i started living like a slob again luckily i managed to finish most of my assignments before starting detox so my school load is very light and the deadline is still very far the fact that i felt definitive withdrawals within two or three days pretty much confirms that i really had a legitimate addiction and those years of porn use and masturbation has really altered my brain's dopamine homeostasis so that the help and advice that i need now how do i recover from such a difficult process of detoxification whilst juggling my exercise chores schoolwork managing finance and keeping my head in the game it is legitimately difficult and i understand i started to understand how some people have great difficulty recovering from addiction once again empathy plus one i know the road to recovery is constant and lifelong and i want to gain some insights and tips to keep myself from becoming worse so this is the kind of thing where i think this is a really good representation of what the road to recovery looks like and there are a lot of important principles here that i'm going to sort of share with you having worked with people who you know have addictions and stuff about kind of how the mind works what the role of an addiction is and what it feels like to try to get off of it or what are the challenges that it takes to get off of something so let's start by sort of defining addiction okay so how do you know if you have an addiction or what is an addiction so as human beings we have a mind and the mind juggles lots of different things the mind experiences positive things it experiences negative things and generally speaking when we try to get motivated to do something the more negative stuff our mind is dealing with the harder it is to do right so let's say that i'm trying to study for an algebra exam and you know my girlfriend just broke up with me the day before so as a result of those negative emotions my mind is going to be creating all these thoughts there's going to be some concerns maybe anxiety maybe fear for the future maybe guilt all kinds of different stuff is going to be going on in my mind and i'm unable to study so in order to focus our mind what we tend to do is use something called a coping mechanism so a coping mechanism is a way that we take some kind of distraction negative emotion negative thought something that gets in the way of us doing what we want to do and we use some kind of tool to like make that thing calm down so in the worst case scenarios people will use things like substances right so like marijuana or alcohol or whatever sometimes we'll use things like video games sometimes we'll use things like pornography so we've sort of figured out is the human race what are the things that are effective at quieting our mind when our mind is unquiet and once our mind starts to quiet down we can start to be more productive so we've sort of figured out almost in like an individual evolutionary sense what works for us and that's oftentimes a pattern you'll see with addicts which is that they'll have something called a drug of choice why do some people have one drug of choice and other people have another drug of choice oftentimes when you're dealing with people who have substance use problems they've tried a lot of stuff right but there's a particular thing that's that their drug of choice and that even has been shown to track back to you know what kind of neuroscience effect a particular substance has so you know some is one of my mentors once put it doesn't actually work like this but you know a particular drug in one person due to genetic variation and all these kinds of other things will light their brain up like a christmas tree and for another person the drug will be different that's why we have a drug of choice so kind of going back we each sort of figure out okay when i have negative emotions and i need to focus here's what i'm going to use to make myself feel better and the array of coping mechanisms is like vast right so we have everything from video games and substances to pornography to also things like meditation and exercise and you know eating comfort food right so what is an addiction so i tend to think about addictions as things that are adaptive and then become maladaptive so over time your coping mechanism which used to help may still work for that one thing but the cost of employing that coping mechanism becomes greater than the benefit so like eating comfort food is great like that can be like good it's nourishing it feels good whatever or maybe it's not nourishing depending on your comfort food but then when we start to like cross the realm of like comfort food into like binge eating or you know like food addiction or things like that that's when it's kind of gone too far this is where it's starting to affect our health sure it still provides us with some kind of emotional benefit but like it's causing problems in other parts of life so if we look at someone who's got an addiction usually there are like two things going on so we're going to talk about different kinds of addiction for a second so for a long time there's been a debate whether marijuana is addictive and part of that that debate has to do with the principle of physiologic tolerance and withdrawal so when i am addicted to something like alcohol or opiates the physiologic effects on my body are profound so alcohol works on something called the gaba receptor opioids tend to work on different kinds of opioid receptors but the mu receptor is really really important and so we know from studies of neurobiology that when you regularly use a substance our receptors will adapt to sort of develop a tolerance so caffeine is another good example where we'll develop a physiologic tolerance so when we start to use caffeine it can keep us up all night but if we use it on a regular basis then it doesn't keep us up all night in fact without it we start to suffer right so we experience some kind of physiologic withdrawal so there are some substances like marijuana for example or even things like pornography or video games that don't appear to develop the same kind of physiologic tolerance and withdrawal that things like alcohol and opiates develop so how do we sort of know this or what's the argument for this the first is that for example our gaba receptors get regulated so heavily that if you have if you're addicted to alcohol and you stop cold turkey the withdrawal that you go through can conceivably be fatal or not conceivably it really can be fatal and is fatal for an unfortunate percentage of people so what happens is literally when you go through alcohol withdrawal depending on what kind of tolerance you have how much you've been drinking and genetics and other individual factors so alcohol kind of slows down neuronal activity so in the absence of alcohol if you've kind of like you know really really like accounted for the depressing effect of alcohol maybe this is the kind of thing where i should draw this out so let's do this so i'll explain we'll explain physiologic tolerance real quick okay so let's take a look hold on there we go okay so i'm just going to explain this real quick okay then we're gonna go back to the main part so let's talk about physiologic withdrawal so let's say i use something called alcohol okay so here's my okay so here's the signal okay and then here's my response now if i use alcohol which is a depressant so the gaba receptor is a hyper polarizing receptor so it's a chloride usually chloride ion channel is the simplest way to think about it makes it harder for your neurons to turn on basically so when i add alcohol what happens is that alcohol essentially oh sorry hold on gigi okay so alcohol essentially does is it lowers the effect of the signal okay so alcohol artificially puts us here so then our brain is like oh we're supposed to be in the middle so what i'm going to do is i'm going to adapt i'm going to change the nature of my neurons i'm going to make them more sensitive because alcohol has a depressing effect so my physiologic adaptation is going to be in this direction we can also look at something like caffeine where this is my normal function here's my response and so what does caffeine do caffeine amps it up right so this is caffeine and so then over time our our brain is like hold on a second hold on a second this is like we're too amped up let's go ahead and adapt and let's lower our responsiveness so then what happens is once you add the blue and green arrows together what you end up with is you end up in the middle which is why if you look at issues of withdrawal like without caffeine the reason that it sucks is like you operate down here right so you're like you feel sluggish you feel slow and so what happens in physiologic alcohol withdrawal is you actually operate up here and what does this mean practically what does it mean to like operate up here so what it means to operate up here is you can actually have seizures so your neurons are so so excitable they they depolarize so quickly that you can get unregulated electrical like activity in the brain and you can actually have a seizure and then remember neurons and neuronal functions and depolarizing cells are not just in your brain so you can also get problematic or electrical activity within the heart and you can get a cardiac arrhythmia that results in death so this is why like when people say like marijuana is not addictive what they're referring to is that this physiologic process does not seem to exist with marijuana or it happens at a much much smaller level okay so this is what we mean by marijuana is not addictive but these things like video games like pornography doesn't do this to your you know doesn't do act like this so in the case of opiates for example we'll get uh opioid receptors all over the body so what you'll see is you'll get things like you know so opioids are constipating they will provide pain relief those are two of the biggest things they'll also kind of slow your mind down so when people are going through opioid withdrawal they experience the opposite of those things they'll have diarrhea sometimes they'll feel nauseous or even vomit um they'll get sweaty they'll start to feel like very agitated and restless their pain can actually become more their pain receptors can become more sensitized so opioid withdrawal is like a very very unpleasant experience um which which according to some people that i've worked with is like worse than death um the hands down the worst experience of their life is like the week or two that they go through opioid withdrawal so this is what we sort of mean by like you know some substances are not addictive they're not you don't develop a physiologic tolerance but we clearly develop dependencies on these these uh other things like pornography addiction um video game addiction things like that so then the question is okay like what is that kind of dependency and this kind of goes back to what we were talking about earlier where we use coping mechanisms to help deal with negative emotions right so oftentimes what you end up seeing is if i'm using pornography to deal with negative emotions so that i can function and focus and be productive and exercise and stuff like that right because i have all these kinds of like negative stuff going on i'm unmotivated i'm ashamed of myself whatever and so if i use pornography it kind of like deadens my mind a little bit get some dopamine spurts changes my thinking and then like it kind of equilibriates me so what we tend to see is that those underlying psychological things that you need the coping mechanism to to cover okay those don't go away when you stop using an addictive substance so forget about the physiology for a second we're talking about kind of the emotional coping or the emotional dependence for lack of a better term maybe more than emotional identity related thought related etc mental let's call it mental so oftentimes what you see is that when you take an addiction away from someone or you don't let someone use an addiction you see an upswing of those negative mental states which in turn means that people will reach towards other behaviors so oftentimes when you work in addictions what you find is it feels like you're playing whack-a-mole where the second that you control someone's opiate opioid use they'll start doing things like self-injurious behavior so cutting or something like that so self-injurious behavior is also actually a coping mechanism it's really fascinating when i talk to people who engage in self-self-harm if they're not actually trying to kill themselves there's something about you know self-harm can be incredibly focusing for the mind and so remember that like our brains will figure out like what works for us and sometimes people who are you know have such a negative emotional state that they need something like a sensation of physical pain to obliterate all of their thoughts so the the third kind of thing the bucket here that that tends to pop up as well is sometimes people also develop like issues with eating disorders so the you know kind of the worst case scenarios are i mean if you're in this situation it's not you're not hopeless or anything but as a clinician what can be challenging to deal with until you understand this is someone who's got like two or three unhealthy coping mechanisms and the moment you fix one those negative emotions that were suppressed by the addiction come roaring back and as those emotions come roaring back we start to engage in other things and that's what we see in this situation right so the person stopped watching pornography or dealt with their porn addiction and their impulsive buying behaviors increased so for any given person it may be like you know some combination of all of the above right so some people engage in self-injurious behavior some people engage in video games some people engage in pornography some people engage in impulsive buying some people engage in even like emotionally manipulative tactics to feel loved so this is like a common thing that you know people don't really think about which is when i feel bad in order to get a sense of emotional comfort sometimes what i'll do is like lean on someone else to provide that for me and sometimes that can be frustrating for the other person or i don't know how to ask for it i'm not really aware of it so i'll engage in like emotionally like manipulative behavior to evoke a response from someone else so the key point here is that those underlying emotions that you're using to cope you can get rid of the coping mechanism and when you get rid of the coping mechanism you may recalibrate your neurons after a period of withdrawal right so this is what neuroscience will sort of tell us so like um you know we talk about this when we talk about neuroscience a lot of neuroscientists will sort of talk about this stuff right in terms of like your receptors and stuff like that but clinicians will also appreciate like that there's a there's kind of a personal individual psychological component to this and that component is what causes the whack-a-mole sort of thing to pop up right because now like you used to deal with this with pornography and now the porn isn't there anymore so like how are you gonna deal with it we're gonna start buying more now the other thing that we tend to see which is also very common is this person is saying as i've quit pornography it's harder for me to exercise harder for me to study harder for me to focus i don't feel motivated why is that well we sort of explain that right because the reason that you use pornography is to get your mental state calmed down so that you can focus your mind so as you remove that band-aid as you remove that coping mechanism expect all of this stuff to happen so expect first of all that you may start leaning on other unhealthy coping mechanisms you may start to experience more mental discomfort the good news with both of these things is that this is like there's good strategies that you can use for this so the first is this is why we teach healthy coping mechanisms right this is why mindfulness is so big meditation is so big because if we want to bring that mental stress down and we don't want to use pornography if we just take away the pornography that stress will come back so that's where we can use something like meditation to lower that stress over time that too has like a couple of different angles to it right one is like development of empathy development of compassion that's all like more mental stuff and there's also physiologic or neuroscientific stuff right so we'll see that we'll disengage things like the default mode network we'll lower our cortisol or crh production which is cortisol corticotropic releasing hormone um will will sort of affect things physiologically and will sort of affect things kind of like more globally on a mental or psychological level so that's why developing healthy coping mechanisms is really really important and a big important piece of sort of coming off of a dependence now you don't have to develop a healthy coping mechanism it just makes it a lot easier okay the second thing to understand is that at the end of the day why are addictions so difficult to get rid of and it's because of that internal emotional stuff right so like as someone who's done a lot of work in addictions like the main thing that i found is that you can go to aa you can start this medication you can go to rehab that'll all help right so those are all evidence-based interventions or not evidence-based but evidence supported or evidence scientifically validated interventions that's the right term that work but the truth is it doesn't work for everyone right so what's the difference what's the difference between someone who goes to rehab for 30 days comes out sober stay sober for a year and someone who goes to rehab for 30 days and like relapses like within three days of coming out and some of that is luck some of it is just the role of the dice but some of it is actually the a big part of it is the internal work right so what what is that emotional stuff that comes up we talk about coping to kind of bring it down but where are these feelings originating from and you can do that core work right so is it feelings of shame is it feelings of i'm i've fallen behind i've screwed up my life i'm so be you know like this person is better than me is it insecurity is it a seeking love right so this is all kinds of things that happen in addiction so a good example is sometimes you'll have people who have a history of trauma who really just want to be loved and when it comes to addictions it's like it's really easy to find someone who you can feel love for if both of you all are addicted to the same substance right like because then y'all are together you're in it through thick and thin you're together you're together you're together you feel so good right like like there are all kinds of other emotional needs that get met through addictions so you have to do that internal emotional work right so this is where when you think a little bit about let's say impulsive buying or pornography or whatever what are the actual feelings or mental state that you're trying to improve right what is the experience of you off of your drug of choice so this is where like you know it's gonna be negative probably right but then like you know is it anxiety and then like then you need to ask yourself sure you can use a coping mechanism to kind of reduce it and hopefully through meditation over time you'll you'll change that core part that it's coming from but in cognitive behavioral therapy there could be some kind of schema in sanskrit we call it a samskar right so like what is it that you're trying to fix and then where does that thought come from where did you start feeling that way how did you start to think that way and so ultimately you know if i'm working with someone for example who's like i don't know like um let me just think of an example of someone who's you know let's say like you're working with an in cell and so in cells have all these belief systems and those belief systems are are you know there and sometimes they're also using substances and stuff like that and the reason is because when or doomer let's say so when i stop using the substance all my doomer thoughts come back right the world is going to end this is going to happen i'm never going to amount to anything and then so then the question is like when did you start to lose faith in the world right and how did you lose that faith and as you go track back to the source of your thoughts when did you start feeling this way when where did these thoughts originate from don't worry about the evidence this is where a lot of people get tripped up right so like if you talk to someone who has a negative scheme or a negative some scar they'll tell you about the evidence oh because of this and like alphas and betas and sigmas and they'll use all this like pseudoscientific kind of bs right they'll give you lots of evidence to confirm their belief but you can try to dispute that if you want to you're never going to get anywhere the question is where did the original belief come from because our mind once we believe something our mind looks for confirmation that's what the confirmation bias is so if you're dealing with an addiction a couple of things to keep in mind the first is that as you extract yourself from it it's going to be a bumpy road physiologically this is where you should actually see a medical professional so if you actually have a substance use disorder you should absolutely see a medical professional because some of these things can be life-threatening you know even in the non-substance use category can definitely help to see a medical professional because they'll know these kinds of things right they'll help you support you through that sort of stuff but as you cut back on your pornography be prepared for the other things to rise up and watch what happens right why are you doing that when do you impulsively buy it when you're emotionally not feeling good recognize that as that negative emotional stuff comes up there's going to be an impact on your productivity the good news is that that impact is generally speaking temporary so in the same way that your brain will like reacclimatize right so like our brain develops a tolerance and if we cut the substance that tolerance will go away over time in the same way you'll find a way to get motivated again it'll just like your brain will just kind of recalibrate it takes longer though than some of these physiologic tolerances so the physiologic tolerances can get better within anywhere from 72 hours to like a week sometimes there are more like long-term effects of like sobriety like a month out three months out six months out you'll start to see cognitive benefits and things like that people just feel better so you may be in for that you know motivational slump for like a couple weeks month maybe even two three and that's kind of okay right so your body has a natural tendency to heal so just have faith in that the other thing is that if you lean on other coping mechanisms that equilibriation will happen less does that make sense because now we're not needing to equilibria because we're just using something else right so even in for example alcohol detox we'll give people particular medications that work on the gaba receptor as a substitute for alcohol and slowly taper that down and that's how you sort of safely detox someone from alcohol so if you're using a substitute you know that's going to slow the process of equilibriation but it may smooth it out a little bit next thing to remember is that at the end of the day those negative thoughts you can use an unhealthy coping mechanism or develop a healthy coping mechanism that'll smooth out your kind of return to normalcy and then the last thing to consider is at the end of the day you may need to do that internal like work right so the kinds of negative states that arise when you are not using where do those negative mental states come from where did they originate from what are your actual fears concerns et cetera and this is why it sounds kind of weird but like this is why like you'll see internal emotional work cathartic kind of work happen in basically all fields of addiction recovery so you can see a licensed therapist right who will like talk you through that stuff hopefully accelerate the process but you also see that things those kinds of things in alcoholics anonymous where people will go up and they'll say hi my name is olik i'm an alcoholic and then they'll share right so there's some kind of like processing acknowledgment of negative feelings emotional support camaraderie like so there's there's some research even into the common factors between like therapy and other things so like how does alcoholics anonymous work how does therapy work is there some overlap and it turns out that there is so you have to do that core overlap kind of work which is like internal emotional processing so if y'all are in this kind of situation it's really really common right so there's going to be some neuroscience stuff going on but like try to develop healthy coping mechanisms and understand what you're in for right so that's that's the key thing that's the reason we're really digging into this is like understand what you're signing up for in the phases of it and what you can do to sort of reduce it questions food addiction is the same right so like food it doesn't matter so each of these things depending on your substance or your choice of addiction the support that you're going to get is going to be like or the neuroscientific or psychological support you're going to get is going to be a little bit tailored to that thing so for example with food addiction we get a lot of very physiologic signals of satisfaction we also get things so i've seen this in people who are addicted to food so when you eat a bunch of food you get an insulin spike if you eat carbohydrates that is when you get an insulin spike right because you get this peak of blood sugar your blood sugar shoots through the roof you get a surge of insulin as you get a surge of insulin you move from a sympathetic which is a sympathetic nervous system mode to a parasympathetic nervous system mode so remember in the paris in the sympathetic nervous system mode my anxiety is going to be worse my mind is going to be active right like i'm going to see danger is more real all this stuff is in dr k's guide and when i move to a parasympathetic mode it's gonna slow my mind down right you go into food coma and so what some people with food addiction will do is they'll activate a food coma to slow down their mind quiet their thoughts make it easy for you to sleep right so we'll see like food addiction and insomnia kind of go hand in hand sometimes too because why do you have trouble falling asleep because my mind right oh my god i have all these thoughts i have all these worries and they're too much to handle i can't fix them because when you're going to bed at night you can't fix anything so any anxiety or thought that you have is going to be like hopeless right the future climate change and so your mind gets ramped up you get sympathetically activated danger feels more real and so when you food coma yourself all that stuff kind of chills out like we're content right slows things down so in each of these addictions there are going to be unique impacts on your body and mind and ultimately overcoming each and every one of these involves understanding like what you're up against so then you can tailor things right so when i work with people who have a food addiction one of the key things that i target is insomnia and so if you can target that insomnia really well then somehow it really seems to help them yeah right so someone's saying you know masturbation before sleep it's another big reason right so what do you do you're all these thoughts and worries and then you masturbate and then you get the surge of dopamine you feel kind of content you feel a little bit sleepy so it's like it's almost like a self-medication right so you need a healthier coping mechanisms you can maybe do something like yoga nidra sometimes i'll prescribe medication to people depending on the situation right so someone's saying this is so hard i can't do it so i can empathize with that it is definitely very hard the thing about a lot of this like overcoming substance use or especially like the non-substance use addictions what you really have to do the main thing that you have to do is nothing so it's not it's the avoidance of behavior right and that sometimes is the hardest thing of all like what you have to do is just tolerate it because your body will recalibrate it's just going to be really painful doing nothing sucks yes it does sometimes doing nothing is the hardest thing of all that's why it's so hard to meditate yeah so sometimes there's comorbidity with depression and restless leg absolutely this is kind of interesting there's a paper by let me see if i can find this so there's a video in dr k's guide about ayurvedic variants of depression and let me see if i can find the paper um i can't find it right now there's a good paper by f uh let's see if we can find it this way i know this is kind of a random question but fava depression anchor attacks yeah so there's um [Music] this is interesting if you guys want to know about restless legend so i think this is the original paper so 1998 right so it's a little older but uh it's talking talking about anger attacks and depression the really interesting thing is that there's like um approximately one-third of depressed outpatients present with anger attacks so this is something that like is kind of confusing for many people a lot of people who have clinical depression don't realize because they don't feel sad what they do is they get pissed and they just have a very very short fuse and then they think they like kind of need to chill out and stuff but like really what it looks like is it it looks it resembles a clinical depressive episode it just gets it manifests as anger so the interesting thing is that there are some studies in this guy the guy who wrote this paper was telling me that when he has patients who have depression with anger attacks he'll provide uh treatments like repinerole which actually seem to help depression with anger attacks and repentant role is also a treatment for restless leg so there's like some comorbidity there for sure and we don't really know too much about it if you all have depression and russell's leg definitely go see a psychiatrist right and and look into that kind of stuff it's cool science is neat man there's like so much information out there i couldn't find the paper itself in in my drive so sorry about that but that's the reference if you guys want it okay restless leg syndrome is a neurologic condition where your legs will just like kick like so you know that sometimes you'll have muscle twitches right so like sometimes we just like twitch so in restless leg syndrome oftentimes when people try to go to sleep their legs will kick it can be quite profound um can keep people from sleeping and can also keep people from sleeping next to you it's actually quite debilitating like or it can be quite debilitating i should say you
