because I feel like when a guy is scared to speak to me because I'm a girl and he's attracted to me and he's scared of rejection I don't know anything about him I've never met him or spoke to him he's working up the courage across the room what he's done is he doesn't know me he doesn't like me he's looked at me that's it that's all he knows what my body looks like and now he's scared he won't get what he wants thank you so much for staying up late I know you're in EU time and um but I love it I'm a night owl it's it's absolutely fine I'll be up till like 6 a.m okay um but I'd love to just get your thoughts about everything that's going on with like deep fakes and you know if you have any perspective to add um oh I I how much time have you got I I feel like I have so much to say it's it's a really hard thing to Broach because I feel like most of the people who are watching right now um like as in onlookers to the whole drama from start to finish I I feel like there is a distinct lack of empathy and that a lot of people cannot actually visualize what about this is so painful and damaging and so I'm seeing that we're being met with a lot of confusion as to like what's the harm why do you care this just comes with the territory these sorts of remarks and uh it's it's really difficult to articulate and unfortunately a lot of I'd say like I'm struggling to find a single woman who hasn't been assaulted or had some really heavily traumatizing experience with a man and one of the symptoms of having experience with that sort of thing is being numbed being overwhelmingly numb or disassociating when things like this happen and it's really really hard when everyone's trying to get you to explain what's so damaging about it to get in touch with those feelings in the immediate aftermath of finding out that it's happening and I think that's probably something that quite a lot of us have in common you've experienced this whether we're streamers or not is that when you're immediately asked to justify why you're hurt at a time where you're most likely to be very numb and struggle the most to articulate how you're feeling that that's a fascinating point I mean because my first question just as you started talking like the first question that popped into my mind is how is it damaging so I have no doubt that it's damaging I've seen overwhelming research and I've worked with some people who have had who have been in non-consensual pornography situations but can I mean is it okay if I ask you like are you able to provide some insight I mean I feel like when I first sawed a pornography that was made out of someone's likeness it was Anita sarkeesian and she made a series called feminist frequency and a popular stream I disliked her so he basically immobilized his entire viewership against her and she just reviewed computer games and people started photoshopping her face onto pornography and specifically sex acts that were considered degrading um to mock her the first instance I had of this was not someone who's lonely and parasocial wanting to masturbate over someone that they are emotionally connected to my first experience of this my first knowledge of existing was as a weapon to humiliate and degrade women so I've only ever known it as an attack I've never really like this is the first time I've ever seen it or heard it described in a parasocial sense and obviously I understand it like I already I explained it to my audience as well I was like I'm pretty sure that we have a saturated Market of boobs and that you can see boobs whenever you like for free on the internet um but what people crave and what's much rarer is intimacy yeah and so when you pick someone like your boss to get deep faked and people submit pictures of their bosses to deep fake and their friends and family like these are the kinds of things that deep fake markets play into and a lot of the paid transactions happen for um so I get it I understand that these are people who want a sense of some semblance of connection and it's a pseudo collection connection it's not real but at the same time I'm very very very aware that there is a mix of dominance and humiliation gym tied into this but these people are expressing a desire to dominate and humiliate me and even the people who pretend that they don't get it and go I don't understand what's the harm it's just a cartoon it's not real um a lot of Studies have shown that if you get a person if you get man and make him play computer games and he's playing against another player who he can't see or interact with if they give that person a male Avatar and he beats that person or he gets beaten by that person that that male Avatar out does him he will be given a chance to adjust the Avatar of the opposite player after being beaten and if it's a male character they don't add anything sexual to the Avatar but if it's a female character and that character beats them they'll add sexual attributes to their Avatar to Mock and ridicule them and take them down a peg um there's a huge desire for porn of lots of different body types not just the stereotypical Beauty standard anymore because people are out there looking for someone who looks like their neighbor or someone they know personally and there's a huge appetite for porn where an employee humiliates their boss by sexualizing her and you know by you know so like I I feel like on some level even if it's unconscious a lot of the people who pretend they don't know why it's weird or upsetting um would do this unconsciously would respond to being dominated by a female or outperformed by a female by doing this and a lot of the studies tried to find like the same behavior in women towards men and it isn't there generally speaking most women will not sexualize a man who's who's outdone them or humiliated them or overpowered them or is like in a higher position at work so I I don't I I find it serious I question whether people genuinely don't get it or whether it's just a gas light I just I I I I I I have as I'm suspicious of people who pretend they don't understand what's wrong with this so I can maybe offer some explanation there because so on the one hand I I take things at face value but I could not I had a lot of trouble empathizing with um people who have been in this scenario so like if I it's taken a long time for me to learn to just accept if people are hurt that they're hurt but I think a big part of why it could be hard for men to understand this is because we may not respond the same way or We Believe we may not respond the same way simply because we have not experienced a sexual objectification so I put I try to put myself in this person's shoes and I ask myself hey if there was a picture of my genitals on the internet like how much would it bother me and and even amongst men like you know the pictures of genitals are freely advertised right like sometimes we'll send them to people because pictures of our genitals being out in the public is not something that would bother us I'm saying Us in general not but and so I I do Wonder so it's really interesting to hear you say I mean I do think that there are a lot of people who probably understand on some level it's harmful and just don't care but I it's kind of like almost leaning into what you said is that men don't get objectified quite as much and therefore we may not understand what the harm is if we haven't experienced it ourselves uh I mean one of the ways that I have because I've experienced that too that disconnect and it's that if I posted pictures of my genitals on the internet and it spread people would change their behavior towards me significantly the minute that I seem sexually available in any way shape or form I'm fair game to humiliate physically assault rape and attack um and this happens to porn stars there are many porn stars who get murdered on their doorstep because a fan of their work will think that they're easy and that they will just sleep with anyone so they'll turn up and go hey I'm here you should sleep with me and they'll be like who are you get off my land and they'll be like how dare you you're a [ __ ] you'd sleep with anyone so why are you turning me down what I'm not good enough for you I'm better than all those men you've slept with and you'll sleep with anyone how dare you insult me like this and then they murder them and that's happened to so much that exact scenarios happen to many many sex workers and so there's this idea that the minute you are consensually sexual everyone can help themselves to you and I've experienced this and I've seen it and I've seen it happen to other people um there are there are so many ways I could describe the way it changes the treatment of you and the consequences um can you tell me a little bit about that there was a woman who had um she was coming with someone so she was doing something sexual on the screen for this person they recorded it and leaked it and it ended up on a revenge porn website and lots of people saw it and all her friends were messaging her going have you seen this she begged them to take it down they did not she had two children and the Deep fake it wasn't a deep fake it was just revenge porn but it was used against her in court to say that she was not a fit mother and so because someone leaked that footage without her consent she lost custody of her children yeah um that it's also used against women in rape cases so if you get raped police will spend months doing a back to ground check on you and decide whether or not you could have ever possibly been raped because if you've had too much sex um you're obviously consent there's no way you couldn't have consented so people will decide whether they believe you when you report a rape or a sexual assault based on your sexual history and if you have any sexual content out there of any kind you'll be considered a [ __ ] if you once had a stint of doing only fans or whatever to make ends meet and then you start to be a teacher and you train for years and years to be a teacher you can be fired as a teacher because you once had a career in only fun so there's this idea that once you're a sexual person is a woman like maybe if you had a picture of your genitals out there nothing would change no one would care in fact the revenge porn websites that were releasing and keeping all of these pictures would quite often Target musicians and show pictures of their genitalia and nobody nobody changed their behavior towards these rock stars and these males who were on the site it was purely the women who had physical consequences who were fired who were stalked you had dreams of men because it didn't just leak the the Revenge pawn it leaked to your details as well that go Oh Yeah from here I was looking at some research that showed that 50 of things that are uploaded to revenge porn websites have names and locations attached to them right this is an older study so this study's like five years old but um and and so it's like the revenge porn comes with the doxing which is terrifying yeah yeah so like that that if I saw a picture of someone's dick and was given then their address and their number there is no part of me that would want to go ring them up and go hello I saw your dick but for some reason when we do that with women there are lots and lots of men who will dog pile on that and go ha and then immediately start harassing her just because I've seen her naked and they now have her details and so like what's your understanding of like why people may think that that's okay we stigmatize female sexuality as a flaw with them okay um I think we stigmatize female sexuality quite a lot so um men can gain status from sex but women lose it um and it's even defined to how we treat women medically our understanding of their sex um so help me understand that last statement what do you mean by it affects how we Define people medically there are loads of ways in which we pressure women and their Lifestyles like I constantly am being told um I will run out of eggs and I will regret my entire existence if I don't lower my standards and get with a man now like I have people who are up in my chat and say what are you doing with your life stop [ __ ] around in front of the camera you need to find a husband before you're too old and left on the Shelf because you've produced all of your eggs and you're at the end where you won't be able to produce anymore and you won't be able to have kids and you'll die alone and you should panic because this is your entire Worth right and we found out very very recently um through chemotherapy the the idea that women produce all of their eggs in the womb and then that's it that's all they have is a myth because there were people who were supposed to be rendered infertile by radiation um and the eggs are actually recovered and they produced more eggs after the radiation therapy after the chemotherapy and this was a revelation women can produce more eggs what and yet we've been using this pseudo fact that we assumed without any further research I mean I'm pretty sure this could have been very easily found out I'm pretty sure this could have been found out much earlier but every woman who goes through chemo has been told when we do this to you you won't be able to have kids you know and so like I am being pressured and have felt this pressure my whole life to change my mind about not wanting children because it's been considered a biological fact that I will run out of eggs and things like this so I have to go and find a man and I have to be loyal to him now and so like there are lots of biological facts and medical facts that aren't actually true about a woman's body like the idea that your vagina gets loose if you have too much sex and then you'll be all too used up and no man will want you and like these things are being presented as medical facts I'm being told female can't pair bond if they have too many sexual partners so I won't be desirable unless they settle down with one man like these things are being used against me and then used to say that I'm used up or somehow less of a woman or less worthy and so like it ties into like our medical understanding of human beings and we use that as if it's fact to justify mistreating women saying they're used up saying that they're leftovers so I I'm gonna can I just add a couple of things to that add some maybe push back a little bit um so the first is that this idea that having sex with different penises loosens the vagina is like let me just it's patently false right so there's this like there's a very simple experiment like if I eat big big burgers and I eat lots of different food it's not like my face ends up like if I've taken big bites all the time it's not like my face is like wobbly afterward right I can take as many big bites as I want to for burgers and hot dogs and salads and sandwiches and it's not like my face is loose and it can't like chew food like it's just not I I have no idea where this comes from it's not when you say it's like we use no that's not biologically accurate it and I don't understand what the biological differences between having sex with a lot of different penises and one penis over and over and over again like that's physiologically the same thing yeah right like there's no and so some of that stuff is just false I think that what I what I tend to see is that for a lot of discussions around this stuff like people's understanding of medicine and biology is very wrong so so that you're you know you're kind of like too old and stuff like that from from the medical standpoint I'm not actually so surprised that for a long time we believed what we believed in medicine I think that's actually still largely true because the chemotherapy makes me think probably what happened is you're giving someone chemotherapy first and then you're giving them another agent afterward which stimulates stem cell production and if you artificially stimulate stem cell project this is my sense if you artificially stimulate cell stem cell production with a certain medication you may be able to make new uh eggs that makes actually perfect sense that that could happen but I wouldn't go as far as to say that our medical I mean our medical establishment may have been wrong but I think there's a lot of data to support that a lot of the ooh Genesis or egg development happens actually before birth um but say that we become like that we only have a short period of time to have kids has been used against women to pressure them and there are whole cultures that call women on the shelf or leftovers after 25 based on the idea that they're at their most fertile when they're young oh and it's been a justification to molest young women who aren't you know fully developed in under the guise of saying I'm getting everyone she's most fertile it's natural so I do think that medically we deliberately misunderstand how women's bodies work in order to justify assaulting them degrading them and considering them lesser I think that's well documented yeah so I I would just I think there's a Nuance there I'm not disputing at all that people will use biology to justify negative or harmful actions I just think that these are incorrect biological assumptions or they're being co-opted for like poor purposes so even if there's a certain window in which women can get pregnant which I think we sort of biologically understand that that's true that there's something called menopause after which it's very hard for a woman to get pregnant and there's something called puberty before which it's very hard for a girl to get pregnant the biological facts and using biological facts for justification are two completely separate things in my mind and in my experience a lot of the people who are using biology to justify something actually don't understand biology just like this penis thing like it makes no biological sense like there's no date like where is that coming from you know it doesn't it doesn't make any sense and so even people who say that oh like women are at their maximal fertile that may be a biologically true fact but that doesn't justify any kind of behavior or the value judgment that we place on it is like completely different in my mind and and that that's where maybe we agree to disagree but like I'm not disagreeing that people will use biology and but it's my experience that most of the time when I hear people saying [ __ ] like that they actually have no idea what they're talking about they actually have the biology like very wrong even if they're justifying it for whatever it's just that they just have no clue like they don't actually understand biology I I don't know we got regardless of like because I can give you a long history of like medically what's happened to women because of the stigma towards whatever but I think it's beside the point I think like the main thing is that I feel like the reason why you having a dick pic leaked and me having like any lewd pictures leaked the reason why we'd have different set of consequences and why that might be a disconnect um is both social and personal and that is that a lot of women have personal experience of being dehumanized mistreated and being put in danger the minute people consider them to have a sexuality um and this is really emphasized in sex workers who quite often been missing or get murdered all the time and nobody cares about them because they're [ __ ] like it's very rare that it's ever investigated when a sex worker gets murdered by her clients for example they disappear no one looks no one cares um and the you know know this whole idea of a pure victim changes how whether or not people believe someone who has been assaulted whereas like someone who's had sex a thousand times with a thousand different men could still say no to one of them and end up being raped and yet it's still used as evidence in court as to decide whether or not a woman has been raped or not is her sexual history things like this so I think like there's that aspect and then the overarching social aspect that people don't really consider is that men are not often considered sexual beings and they do not have their sexuality positively acknowledged so um for example they're rarely ever called Beautiful the rarely ever admired for their sexuality and the way that women are so women are hypersexualized and men are under-sexualized and so when women get hypersexualized and it's a danger to their safety and it feels degrading and terrifying a lot of men can't empathize because they picture themselves being lusted after by lots of women and they'd love that they'd love to be sexually acknowledged and so like and for women they're like I wish it would stop I would give anything for it to stop so when men complain about not being sexualized and not having their sexuality acknowledge being turned down for sex by their wives um not being called Beautiful remembering compliments for years because it happens so [ __ ] rarely the women are like why would I sympathize with you that sounds like heaven like yeah and so that's it's it's really hard to empathize with the opposite position because there's a certain level of Envy like there's a set like inv men who can go unacknowledged and be invisible on a casual walk on a summer's day whereas I have to weigh up do I want to be baking hot and sweaty and uncomfortable or do I want to be in danger because those are my two choices and so I I feel like that that's an aspect of why this is happening in front of mainly a male audience and they have no idea how to empathize I think that's that's a really cool way of framing it and Anita like can I just Echo what you said so I it's it's such a good point that women are hyper sexual uh sexualized or I would say even my experience has been it's not just sexualization but appearance and compliments women are judged based on their appearance even if it's not sexual so sexuality is a certainly they're hypersexualized and I've met so many men that and now it's kind of clicking for me like a couple things after hearing what you were saying one is that I've met so many men that do remember a single kind thing that was told to them years ago like they don't get compliments um I remember my own experience of starting to receive compliments at some point in my life and being really really confused and thinking that people were making fun of me because I had grown up to be at best ignored and generally speaking ridiculed or insulted for my physical appearance and so it was really confusing for me at the beginning and then the other really interesting thing just the kind of thinking about how different our experiences are so on the one hand men are sending dick pics and I'm not saying all men you know so I think a lot of us are decent men out there are sending dick pics unsolicited to women and on the flip side they're paying for boobs right so the idea that like if a thousand women started sending me boobs tomorrow um a lot of men may think that that's that they would like that kind of thing and and this is where I have worked with some men who have been sexualized and this is where like they learn real quick that it's not the grass is greener kind of thing that they were thinking in fact it's very degrading um and just just like it is for women and so interestingly enough the the men that I've worked with that tend to be hypersexualized really really hate it and they basically will have experiences that are very similar to women now that's that's a really interesting point about the lack of compliments and how we we treat people that's great helps me understand the way that I've bridged the Gap from my male friends who don't quite understand and don't empathize with me is I go stop imagining loads of women doing this to you imagine men doing this to you imagine going into a prison and having to work there and all the men there maybe most of them weren't done for rape or anything sexual but you don't know which ones have been done for something that's at all and they're all looking you up and down and licking their lips and wolf whistling at you and going come on sweetheart come closer to the bars I won't bite and you have to endure that every single day and work around them and not know what's going to happen to you that's what we're experiencing you were imagining loads of women fawning over you complimenting you being desperate to sleep with you no we're dealing with the prison scenario that's imagine that and then they get it then it clicks if they deal if they imagine having to deal with mail lust they suddenly understand the discomfort so much better yeah I I think it's the the huge point there it's I think it's a brilliant uh analogy is a big part of it is like do you want this sexual attention and the whole challenge that a lot of women face in some men too is that they don't want the sexual attention they don't want to be sexualized I'm not interested in a sexual relationship with you the scenario is not imagine that people are lusting after you that you are lusting after that's not the scenario the scenario is Imagine people are lusting after you that you are not interested in yeah um yeah that's this is very enlightening thank you so much for sharing all this stuff Anita thank you for having me I think like the the thing that I've noticed is that this has been going on for so long but nobody's ever taken it seriously or ever cared and like I said a lot of it's been used to attack people that you dislike both male and female um usually watching someone get shafted was a way to humiliate them we even draw caricatures of politicians um being in sexually degrading situations in order to humiliate them as an expression of hatred for them and so like historically since this whole thing has begun it's been a way to humiliate and debase and kind of degrade someone's popularity and things like this I mean one of the earliest examples I can think of is in the medieval times there was an outbreak of people persecuting witches and burning witches and they used to use paintings they made caricatures of women kissing the ass of the devil or licking the ass of the devil so there are actually medieval paintings of like analingus as a way to say like witches are evil they're terrible people they suck up to the devil you should hate them you should find them we should burn them like as far back as I can think when it's drawing people in sexually compromising positions has not just been a fantasy it's specifically been a way to justify harming women it has been something that we've ubiquitously throughout history used as a humiliation tactic and so like I I find it really strange when people then do that for hundreds of years to the point where such an established thing came out of time I've seen Trump being done in the ass by Putin as a caricature by so many different artists like how do people not know what this means to the artists and what their intentions are towards the esteem and like the social standing and everything of the subject matter like this is a thing that has existed for so long but also we predicted it into the future like I've recently tweeted about how Star Trek and Deep Space Nine had a hollow deck where you could simulate realities and how some of the characters got in trouble in various situations for simulating people they knew and putting them in sexual positions I've seen those episodes TNG right yeah yeah and deep Deep Space Nine like they did a really good episode on it where um the Ferengi who were known to be heavily misogynistic um there was a client who wanted a Holodeck simulation to sleep with Kira and um so he's stalking Kira trying to get good pictures of her face so he can transpose it onto like a model to sleep with in the Holodeck and he finally gets all together they clock onto what he's doing so they replace it they if they change it before he sells it so that it's his face on a female model so that when the client goes in and opens the curtain he thinks he's going to sleep with a simulation of Kira he sees a simulation of a woman with a Ferengi head um and so like that in that in that situation they wrote that whole situation for her to be angry and she does she attacks Quark for this and like they empathize with her they know it's humiliating the whole situation is set up to say like he's trying to stalk and humiliate her for his own prophet and she's angry and it's not okay and then like the generation that was raised on this sci-fi is asking me why I'm bothered about being deep faked so what I'm hearing from you Anita is is a very Central Point about the usage of sexual material or how people interpret sexuality and almost it like gives people license to violate people's boundaries to treat them unwell that we and we as a society are also using sexual material to dominate and humiliate people and so you're what I'm kind of hearing you say loud and clear is hey hold on a second when we've got political cartoons that have Trump and Putin doing things or other people doing things it's clear that when sexuality gets entered into the picture it denigrates humiliates people it has real consequences and and by the way that's I've read research that mirrors a lot of what you're saying so it's really interesting but the number one reaction to women after revenge porn is how they adjust their life they start to live different ways or not not just women so ten percent of men as well um well will change the way they live they change who they see they change how they commute they change how they walk down the street their whole life changes based on this kind of thing and it kind of makes sense right because if sexual denigration is associated with all of these things including if you're viewed as a sexual object or you put out or you're sexually active that entitles people to a particular access to you then I I think you're making a very strong case of forget about the emotional impact for a second the real life impact is quite profound in terms of how you're treated how you're not taken seriously by law enforcement how it gives people license to crap on you in a particular way even in terms of the medical establishment which I I'll own by the way I mean like even things like the diagnosis of Hysteria being related to the womb is a really good example of just like people not really understanding women are having empathy for their like experience of things I mean the fact that back in the medieval not medieval arids you could literally get clinically diagnosed for a fingering or a vibrator from your doctor like the first vibrator ever invented was by a doctor he would cure hysteria when men were horny it was considered like a natural thing but when women were horny it was considered hysteria and something that needed to be cured and a medical condition like that's how much we just dislike female sexuality that we just consider it craziness I mean I completely agree with you I think there's another layer to this which is that I think the reason that it was such an effective treatment I'm not disputing that it was an unfair way to characterize problems and diagnoses and treatment but one interesting takeaway I remember when I was doing my research on this is how much better the mental health of people can become when they start having orgasms right so if you just like like you know how much does orgasm improve mood it actually improves mood quite a bit especially if it's consensual and stuff like that unclear about things like masturbation and stuff but like you know like some sometimes it it really helps and and so I I can sort of see a perverse logic to like oh like hey I discovered this device and this is a doctor who does not know what a female orgasm is and he's like I've discovered this device and it seems to help people and I will apply the device and then they will shake for a while and the hysteria has left the body the humerus have balanced and it's like they didn't know what an orgasm was it's ridiculous and it's funny how that knowledge was lost and found wasn't it because the up suck theory of like female orgasms and the motion of the Kegel muscles tugging up the semen into the womb and it being necessary to arouse her first in order to conceive was actually an idea that originated in ancient Egypt and so a few thousand years before it was considered absolutely integral to reproduction to give her an orgasm and then by the time we get to the invention of the vibrator somehow knowledge was lost and forgotten and we think oh what's wrong with her she must be crazy if she wants sex like how how does that happen like how do we keep having to ReDiscover that women like sex that that's also an interesting U-turn what is this up suck Theory I've never heard oh so and during various times throughout history um it was considered like so when a woman uh climaxes there is a Kegel motion that does this inside her body and so they theorize that that had evolved or that that mechanism existed to pull semen deeper into the body and you know through the cervix and into the womb and that the abstract technique is this idea that the function that a female orgasm has is to ensure conception like that it actually has a function in regards to uh yeah moving sperm and so like that idea that theory has existed for an incredibly long time and it's actually in um it's documented throughout the ages like there have been recommendations for this including in ancient Egypt it's interesting Theory I'm not sure exactly what happened in the West um I know that a lot of people will talk about abrahamic religious influence I don't know how fair of an argument that is like puritanism and things like that but you know in the East I think uh sexuality was viewed quite differently so in in Japan and stuff it was and you know like from my culture there's the Kamasutra the Kamasutra which is in in actually one of the major goals of life is is God so there are four reasons why human beings exist on this planet and one of them is actually the satisfaction of material desires which we've been okay with but even in India the same thing kind of happened there was like this puritanical kind of wave where a lot of those old Concepts like got buried and and there's some kind of cultural influence that happened where sexuality in India is very repressed right now and there's a lot of really bad I mean it's not just now it's been happening for like a hundred or hundreds of years now there's more awareness of it so there's sexual assault is really really bad um and and even like by police and stuff in some regions and it's it's like pretty can get pretty bad out there we have the same thing here in the UK um there has been a mass wave of scandals regarding even the police sexually assaulting um people and getting away with it and in various ways and having like hundreds of victims knowing that there's no one to report them to they're the police um so like this has been quite a serious issue here as well and we have less than a one percent conviction rate for um for rape here so of reported rapes very few of them actually get uh conviction in court um so yeah like it's I feel like it's something that's quite right spread globally unfortunately yeah so I I have one kind of maybe tangential question so um a fair number of people that I've worked with Will complain about being friend zoned over and over and over again and let me know if this is a little bit too off topic but one of the things that I've kind of noticed is that sometimes like men are so this is kind of a hypothesis I'm putting forward is that men are so starved for companionship compliments Etc that anytime an even remotely sexual object provides them with that they sort of really jump into [Music] romanticizing or sexualizing this person and I've noticed the correlation between people who are compliment starved and complaints of those same people being in the friend zone do you have any thoughts or experience about that yeah plenty I mean um I have uh quite a few male friends because I have a lot of the places I socialize have very male dominated gaming climbing ax throwing do all sorts of everything I've ever gotten into every hobby I've ever had I've been surrounded by men so I make a lot of male friends and one of the things I'll say is yes the compliment thing is a problem because like I'm quite I like to compliment people I like people to know that they're being seen in a good light I had a lot of social anxiety growing up and I was always feeling deeply embarrassed about things people didn't even notice but I was so sure that I should be insecure about so whenever I get the opportunity to put people at ease and let them know that they feel they are appreciated I will in a platonic way that I could totally get away with with female friends and they wouldn't assume anything of it if I liked their nail varnish or if I thought their hair looked great or things like this um but with men it's much more difficult and I feel like I'm working on eggshells because I feel like sometimes well most of the time men are not told taught social skills as well and then if they even if they are taught social skills they're not taught what is a cue for a woman to like them or not like if you go how do I know if a girl likes me um wikiHow and things like that will tell you if she touches her hair if she likes laughs at your jokes if she makes eye contact with you it's like what so I have to look at the floor never laugh if you say something funny it's a try not to laugh challenge or I'll get [ __ ] zoned um because like from the opposite side it feels like [ __ ] zoning if you don't [ __ ] me I'm wasting my time and I'll leave you as a friend so I I feel like when when like there's two sides to this I need it am I I've never heard this hypothesis either which I think is brilliant which is that half the problems in the world today are caused by men learning social skills and dating from wikiHow come on I mean like I've gone on chat because like people there was this study that said point out all the women who are flirting with the photographer right and in this study most of the men just picked all the women who were smiling they couldn't tell the difference between a woman smiling and a woman coming on to the photographer like in the photo um so like I feel like we don't teach men what uh a reciprocation looks like we just don't and I've really noticed it a lot because um when I was a child when I was a teenager they'd be like I don't get it I you laugh at my jokes we spend lots of time together we have these long chats I thought you were into me you've been coming onto me this whole time and I'm like yeah and this is French I'll be like no this is just friendship dude I thought you were my friend yeah and a lot of the time if you ask them hey are you coming on to me they deny it but then they're still mad at you like a lot of them are too embarrassed to say that they like you directly so they'll say indirectly in ways that would be considered friendship from a woman and so like I will happily spend one-to-one time with a friend I will talk about deep things I will care about them I will be a source of emotional support and some men don't get a lot of that from their male friends because it's considered gay or effeminate or just uncomfortable um so they take the piss out of each other and they they don't they test the boundaries of each other as a way to play and have fun but they don't really go deep into like what's troubling them or they don't look for support from each other or admit when they're feeling weak or upset and so when guys feel comfortable enough to do that with me they see it as a form of intimacy whereas I see that as surface level friendship because among females that's normal we we are taught to be communicators we are allowed to develop social skills we are given opportunities to emote and share ourselves and it's not considered humiliating or debasing so we Bond and we develop social skills and empathy in a way that men are getting denied by certain ideas of masculinity so if you have like a toxic idea of masculinity if you have like a really traditional dad it pressures you and goes Boys Don't Cry don't play about Barbie people think you're gay all this sort of [ __ ] um and so you grow up in that environment and you don't know how to relate and no one's ever supported you before and you don't know what that looks like and you have it looks like a special relationship when you make a female friend it looks like you have an intimate connection because what is just the basic moral human default of support and friendship to a woman comes across as intimacy towards man in that situation I I I I saw this dichotomy kind of in an interesting way so I one time had a patient who was disclosed was crying about a moment in their life where they felt like really good and their girlfriend filmed it and thought it was beautiful because this is like a man talking about oh like you know like this was a time in my life and like I was afraid that this was going to happen but it turned out and so it was like just a deeply emotionally vulnerable moment uh she shared it with her friends because she thought it was beautiful and the dude like absolutely flipped out and and it occurred to me like since I've worked with men since then I've sort of realized that it's almost like what the way that women feel vulnerable and correct me if I'm wrong here but there's a certain vulnerability around sexual parts in terms of women that men don't feel in terms of their sexual parts where we feel really vulnerable embarrassed is actually emotionally so this is where since then I've talked to some men and I think this has had some decent effect where I try to explain to them that how would you feel if someone took your Mo like when you were crying because you were whatever and someone shared that with the world like how would you feel like you're comfortable doing that with your partner and the people that are really really close to you but if someone shared that with people how would you feel and that's how women feel when you feel when you share their genitals they're like boobs or things like that and and that's been one thing that I I found to be somewhat effective I don't know if it's actually accurate this is just what I've pieced together in terms of what and this is how like so emotional intimacy for men oftentimes has less to do with genitals and has more to do with or intimacy has more to do with emotional vulnerability which is also part of the reason why men will get confused in terms of girlfriend zoning people because emotional vulnerability and support is part of a platonic relationship but for some men it's actually not and so when you get that from someone you think that you get that from two places your wife or your mom and the person you're hanging out with ain't your mom anyway and and I I feel like you asked me initially uh if I had any experience with the friends or anything yeah I do but I feel like I get [ __ ] zones because I'll have friends who swear down that they're not interested in me romantically and they'll be supportive and they'll act like a friend for a while and then they'll come on to me and I'll be like whoa no dude and they'll be like okay well I need a straight answer is there gonna be something more or am I wasting my time and they kind of make out like that if everything that we've like a 10-year friendship was just a waste of time if it doesn't result in a relationship now and that's hideous and upsetting and I'm like well it's not going to result in a relationship and then because I didn't [ __ ] I get put in the [ __ ] zone I'm no longer a friend because or anything else like I get shifted out of the way in this weird little Zone where I was a waste of time and I thought I had a friend but it turned out I had someone waiting for me to sleep with them and they act like a victim and they make it all Shakespearean like whoa is me for Allah so I have feelings for you and it hurts me so deeply to see you not be with me and get on with your life and so I need to know do you like me or I must go Yonder on the past just green and it's like no dude this isn't some tragedy where you are victimized if I don't sleep with you you're literally saying sleep with me or I dump you as a friend and that's a horrible thing to do with someone you're acting like the victim here you're not I treated you like everyone else you watch me treat everyone else the way I treat you and assumed you were special that's not on me and that's not me hurting you and that's not fair and so like I hate the friend zone because it is a horrible description of a very manipulative thing to do and that is to say that it's a Zone you're put in that you can negotiate your way out of that you can bargain with people and manipulate their feelings by being impressive Enough by giving enough gifts by buying enough diamonds and [ __ ] chocolates and that's so insulting to say that you can buy my feelings that love or attraction is negotiable and they know it's not because if a dude they weren't attracted to or someone in an age bracket or a weight bracket that they weren't attracted to was hitting on them and buying them stuff and giving them time and attention and going golfing with them and listening to their problems all this [ __ ] they listen to me they list to me but I listen to your problems I spent all this time with you are you saying I was wasting my time like if someone did that to them they know that feelings are not negotiable that chocolates don't buy love that that's not how that works but they tell each other you can get out of the friend zone you can manipulate and pressure a girl to like you even if she said no and that is the friend zone is this creepy way this creepy way of playfully saying you don't have to listen to consent you can ask her how she feels and if she says no and she says you're a friend and puts you in this Zone you can force her you can make her change her mind and it's creepy I don't spend time with people who use the term friend zone because if they believe in the friend zone they're a manipulator but they don't even know it and being in the [ __ ] Zone over and over again has been painful losing friends of years that I didn't know were never friends is horrible and I'm the [ __ ] in that story so that that's interesting I've never quite appreciated until you explain that how geographical the friend zone really is right because if you think about it as a space it implies that you can move out of it yeah um and even then a lot of people will think that they've been moved into the friend zone I have been friend zoned right so like that's like it it implies that that's not where you started out you didn't spawn in the friend zone you zoned in or were teleported to the friend zone which is interesting because it implies once again that you can move out of it and I've seen that frustration as well in terms of so people will try to get out of the friend zone and and when I work with people like this what I sort of see is that they're investing investing investing and they're not seeing a return on their investment and so then what they'll try to do is double down and like invest more and more and more and then you build more and more resentment and then the real tragedy is that that resentment carries with the person they carry it with them into their other relationships that resentment then makes it harder for people to be attracted to them but can oftentimes evoke emotional support because you've got someone who's like wow I can see that you're hurting let me be compassionate to you because you're hurting because you're carrying a lot of resentment and then feelings get tangled and then the whole cycle kind of repeats so I I interestingly enough for a lot of people who have been chronically friend zoned the way that I've seen them get better and we've seen this actually a lot is is just in terms of letting go of that resentment like it's it has nothing to do with the outside world it really has to do with what you carry and this is my one of my big complaints about a lot of the perspectives that we'll see kind of in the manosphere is that what I think a lot of people don't really understand and this can be true of women too by the way is that the EXP their experience of the world is influenced by their actions so if I get friend zoned all the time that there's something I'm doing so the most common thing is a fear of rejection that precludes people from making their intentions know early and so then they fall into this thing where I'm afraid you're going to reject me so I'm gonna do nice things so you like me and I'm gonna sack the deck in my favor until I demonstrate to you that I'm so nice and then when I shoot my shot I'm gonna have a 99 chance of success yeah um but anyway I think we've kind of gotten a little bit off topic I'm enjoying talking to you I was just wondering though do you think that there's something else that people need to understand about deep fakes non-consensual pornography is there anything else that you want to share kind of about your experience or your understanding or it's cool that people are starting to have this conversation and they're starting to empathize with the people who've been put in this situation but I've not seen anyone empathize with the sex workers who have gone through all of the work it go it takes to be a sex worker which is a lot you have social stigma it's really hard to back out and do any other job at thereafter you sometimes have to mutilate yourself to keep up with the beauty standard and be able to do your job so you're paying for surgeries and they're agonizing you know all of these sorts of things and you know it takes a lot of expertise it's a really hard thing to do it's very taxing on the body and it can be traumatic at times as a really high turnover rate it's a really [ __ ] hard job right and then you imagine you went through all of that to produce work and someone said thanks I want this but not you so we're just going to put someone hotter's face on it so we can have this piece of work that you put all of that effort into um but you're not enough so we're gonna make it look like someone else and so like like somebody had their work stolen from them something that they had to dedicate their entire life to be to build around like being a sex worker is far and someone yeah their work is being stolen like my face is being used but their body and their work is being used and they're not seeing any profit from this it's being stolen and no one's mentioning them as also being a victim of this why do you think that is because people don't care about women who have sex like for the same reason we don't look into the murders of sex workers like people don't respect them and people dehumanize them when people masturbate over someone they don't think about them or care about them and so like sex workers are not just stigmatized they're dehumanized because they're consumed they're not a person in porn they are a product even the way they're referred to as some [ __ ] gets [ __ ] and then you reference which hole they get [ __ ] in that's the way we talk about sex workers in porn we don't talk about them and their names often we don't humanize them and especially with women that I rarely ever see anything like beautiful princess gets worshiped it receives head from two men at once it's never like that it's usually like some woman being horribly degraded and called names and slapped around and and so like if people desire to see that from someone they generally don't empathize with them um have you even experienced in person people who've been attracted to me not empathizing with me and so I feel like because we objectify sex workers we don't think about their feelings or how they're affected by us and I reckon that's a big part of why people like me and Katie Cinderella and Maya have received our name is everywhere right now where people talk about the effect it's had on us but I don't know a single name of any of the sex workers who had their work stolen and who were considered not good enough that their work wasn't sexy enough until we put someone else's face on it yeah that's that's really interesting do you have any thoughts about how do we start tackling that problem it's hard because this has been so historic um people try to blame things like hook up culture and stuff for how hypersexual we are right now but I think it previous hookup culture oh yeah by thousands of years um I think we've been databasing and dehumanizing sex workers and women like women have been Spoils of War for Millennia so but there were times of equality and I think like looking back to the times where we had oh yeah especially my country um before the Christian Invasion and the Romans we had equality women were doctors leaders Fighters soldiers we had ancestral swords that were passed from Woman to Woman um like women were considered equals in fact one of the tactics of war that the Romans did was ridicule for the men for looking across at the women instead of down at them and they're like huh you're not even men you treat your women as if they're equal to you and that actually caused a stir in our community and made men feel embarrassed to share power do you mind sure I'm so curious what what community are you referring to like when you say my community what is it okay that I asked that as in communities as in people British like okay okay you know the Anglo-Saxons and Vikings like all of these groups okay but like in Europe as well like they have been documented like there were Viking um women who were Fighters and leaders and you know they had standing and they were considered equals it wasn't considered that women were property or just brood mares like they were considered people and so there was whole cultures that established long-standing equality that was brought of them and so I would say like it is not this brand new Progressive thing we need to invent like this has it been established before and we lost it which says to me that there was a time there have been many times in many places where this wasn't a problem and if we can learn more about those cultures we can learn how it was established and how it was lost and like what we need to get back to I and I think it's a good question like how do we deal with this issue where we consume and degrade and we consider penetration to be a way to degrade people and like how do we get to a point where we can empathize with sex workers and things like this and I think like a world where we segregate men and women is a huge place where we establish this resentment um I'd say the place where I would look to start it is the toys section of children's like uh toy shops and stuff like this because there is a blue section and a pink section it's so segregated if you look at Lego the early adverts for Lego boys and girls were playing together with colored Bricks now if you look for Lego you have to go to one side of the toy shop to find Lego for girls and another side for Lego for boys and we segregate male interests we project male things to do and female things to do on children and segregate us from each other we're not playing with the same toys with each other we're being told this is what your group does over there and if you try to cross it the parents Panic they're like no don't pick up that Barbie son don't pick up the pink dress son the kids at school will bully you boys don't do that and they genuinely are fearful for their kids if they cross those boundaries they're incredibly new right and the issue with this is like if you segregate us early you get things like I get people in my chat going how do I talk to girls it's like we're people what do you mean we don't speak different languages and they're not asking me how to like hang out with women and make female friends they're not asking me how to talk to a grandma or like their niece who's like 10 or whatever they're asking me how to be a stud how to say stuff that will seduce women they're attracted to they don't phrase it like that but that's what they mean and like so they're like I would get scared and nervous when I talk to women how do I talk to women in a way that will make them like me how do I be a giga Chad to women what do you go for in a man like I think they ask these questions I can't I can't speak to this specifically the people you're referring to I'd like to defend some of the men on the internet there where I think sometimes so here here's my experience of it first of all I think the world would be a way better place if dudes who had trouble talking to women spent a lot of time talking to grannies like I think honestly that is I think a brilliant idea yeah so I and and I I think I'm with you that men will struggle to talk to women I I do think though that some of that is like there's almost like an exposure therapy around anxiety sort of thing where I've worked with a lot of men that they're not just trying to be Chads like they really just struggle to talk to anyone of the opposite sex and and it's it's it's it's it's just super challenging for them like their internal emotional experience is not I mean it may be like conditioned by society and judgment and stuff like that but literally they're like moment to moment experience of communicating with someone of the opposite gender who is anywhere in the ballpark of like dateable for them is very hard um and and I I think it goes back to kind of what you were saying that these are skills that we don't necessarily explicitly teach boys and I think that's actually even applying to girls now too so I've noticed that the the way that we're especially in the digital age like more and more women or that I've worked with are having difficulty in social situations and some of the stuff that you're kind of saying implies that I I'm not saying I don't think you're actually implying this but just to clarify like I think a lot of these challenges social socialization even women talking to women or how does a woman talk to a man without inciting girlfriend zone or things like that that women are actually struggling with a lot of communication as well like I'm not afraid of rejection from men not because I think that they're always going to want to date me or anything like that but because I don't identify and segregate men according to elderly men [ __ ] men and children and like I don't have this like I'm approaching man and what if he doesn't want to date me and if what if he rejects me I'm just like there is a person wonder what he's doing and I go speak to the person and I think like when I'm asked how do I how do I talk to girls how do I get girls to like me I don't think I'm really being asked how do I relate to women because like that isn't actually a real question like you just they're just people like the answer to that is unanimously and most people know this they're just people talk about the things you're passionate about listen to the things they're passionate about talk to them like you would a guy and if you can't talk to them like you would a guy it's probably because you talk terribly about women to guys so like like this issue is like I feel that I would I would push back heavily against so so I I do think so I think this is where your conditioning has given you a particular experience where you can see people as people right but like that's the whole problem is that there's a lot of people who see women as females they don't see them and a lot of them genuinely don't know so how can like any that's like if I were to tell you how do you start seeing your box as a person like do you know how to start seeing your box as a person the case like why is it in question that women are people exactly that's my point so so some people actually grow up in particular situations where that and this is what you've been saying too is that if we look at how women have been objectified a lot of people grow up in situations where there's strong cultural forces that do not I mean this is what you've been saying is that there's strong cultural forces which do not shape people's perception of women as people and so some people genuinely have difficulty understanding how to do that that's why they struggle which is kind of what I was trying to describe too like yeah that there's this category of [ __ ] people that might reject you and it's like how do I I'm scared that I won't get what I want out of you like that's how it sounds to a woman when you're saying like I'm scared of rejections like when that just means that you want to date them and you're communicating with this nervous tentative like how do I speak to you and give what I want and it's like but like normally when the average person who's like socially addressed talks to people they don't immediately want like they don't immediately categorize this bar of people and go I'm scared to talk to them in case they don't sleep with me what if they reject me like that's how it sounds and so it's like really hard for me to empathize with because I'm being asked how do I get girls to like me how do I get them what do I say what's the cheat code code pants all right so so let me ask you this when you talk to men what are you afraid of if anything usually I am not initially afraid of men like to a degree that people are surprised by like if I see a drunk man stumbling around in the street most people would give him a wide berth but on multiple occasions I walk over and go are you lost are you okay do you know where you're going like I got told off by a police officer who watched my YouTube video where I was recording and talking about Tourette Syndrome on the street and I saw a man passed out on the floor so I just went oh free friend picked him up took him to a like well-lit Hotel sat him down started talking to him got him an Uber found out where he lived and got him home I'm not afraid of men I should be all of my experiences would probably I'd be justified in being afraid I've had bad experiences with men but I'm not afraid of them I'm not afraid of being rejected by them I'm not afraid of being attacked by them I just see them as other people right so so I I think that's that's awesome that you're able to get that to that place having talked to a lot of women I'm not saying all women are like this by any means but a lot of women have come to have a default fear of men and consider men to be untrustworthy and what my experience having worked with both sides of the aisle is that when men are afraid of rejection and women are afraid of being taken advantage of or pressured or manipulated or attacked those fears come from experiences and so it doesn't surprise me that you have difficulty empathizing with someone who's afraid of rejection because you say yourself you don't you're not afraid of rejection that seems completely that's not it doesn't sound like that's an experience that you've had a lot of so it makes sense that you would have difficulty empathizing with someone who's afraid of rejection rejected a lot like I spent most of my life not being diagnosed with Tourette Syndrome so people thought I was crazy and people didn't want to spend time with me people weirded out by me like there's a scene in The Joker the latest Joker movie where he has a laughing tick on the bus and everyone's side eyeing him and everyone's uncomfortable and scared of him I was that guy for most of my life when I tried to hang out in social groups they didn't like me when other kids were making friends they wouldn't include me teachers would even reject me and not want to help me and things I know what it is to be rejected so I yeah yeah so so then I'm a little bit what what about your experience does not translate into empathy for men who are afraid of getting rejected so there's a difference there right because you're saying there's like these are these are apples and oranges as I'm hearing you that's what I'm perceiving so I'm curious what's what's different I'm not disputing that by any means so it sounds like definitely if you've had on diet I mean even if you had diagnosed Tourette's like that's a recipe for constant rejection in schools as well as professional situations and all kinds of other places my nose is too big and ever since I've heated my nose and I haven't been able to get over it and it really deeply affected me and there was a time where I bought a guy flowers when I was young as well and he didn't understand the gesture and when I'm not gay why would I like flowers and he threw them away I think one day he'll wake up like in his 30s or something and go oh and realize what I was trying there but for now like he was insulted right I've been rejected by boys and it traumatized me as a kid it it hurt me so much how how is it that you don't fear rejection if you've been traumatized by rejection because I feel like when a guy is scared to speak to me because I'm a girl and he's attracted to me and he's scared of rejection I don't know anything about him I've never met him or spoke to him he's working up the courage across the room and I've seen the scenario a few times what he's done is he doesn't know me he doesn't like me he's looked at me he's lusting after me he likes my ass or tits that's it that's all he knows what my body looks like and now he's scared he won't get what he wants and he thinks that that's this cute nervous shy nerdy thing like that makes him a vulnerable little squish who's so innocent he's he wants to speak to a girl but he's so afraid and nervous but how it comes across to me is he's feeling a lot of pressure to get what he wants from me he wants to get close to my body it's all he knows that's where all of the admiration comes from and he's scared of not getting it he'll be humiliated if he walks up to me and I'm not immediately oppressed and like him back the way he likes me and it's like I feel like that's a lot of pressure whereas like if these people knew me personally and they were scared of rejection that would be different and quite often that turns into the friend zone scenario but often the men that I have bumped into and had experiences with who are scared of rejection are people who don't know me people who just looked at me and now they're like scared to talk to me in case I reject them and it's like why do you even want to get him with me at this point you don't even [ __ ] know me and you're scared that I'll turn you down like I haven't even thought about whether or not I'll date you like you're a stranger to me how do you how do you know so it sounds like you're you have an understanding of what's going on in their head and judgments that they're making about like you're because you're saying that there's there's all the stuff going on in their head right like they're placing all this pressure they're like girlfriend zoning you they're like um where do you get that understanding that this is what's going on in their head I've had friends that I have brought into my life and accepted if you've talked to me about how they felt when they first spoke to me or they've talked about I like this girl I see her at the grocery store all the time but I'm scared to talk to her in case she regret rejects me and they know nothing about her they're scared that she won't fancy them back immediately like and that's weird to me I don't get it like that's not actually being rejected they she can't know you how could she reject anything about you she doesn't know you like if you're gonna have one conversation with her and be scared you'll get rejected like the most rejection you can get is that she doesn't want to hang out with you or isn't interested in the conversation yeah this this that's this makes a lot of sense so so I'm I'm now understanding so I I just connected a couple of dots so if you believe I would bet money that 90 of the men who are listening to this conversation do not believe that you need to be known to be rejected so you just said like right huh like I think you have to know someone to actually reject this yeah so rejected if someone tries to speak to me and and they're like they don't like if I do small talk and I'm like huh nice weather we're having here and they're just like yeah and they walk away like I'll take that as they don't really feel like a conversation but I don't feel rejected yeah my intention I think this is this is awesome because I think this is huge I don't understand exactly what the importance of this is but I wonder if it has something to do with the dehumanization and and it's it's hard I can't put it together and I've just had a long day but something about the statement that you just made that you can't get rejected if someone doesn't know you that's that runs contrary to so much of my experience in the experience like you can get rejected so easily and in fact I I would imagine that a lot of men that I know would agree that it's easier to get rejected without people knowing you and I wonder if huh like how do you want to expand on that because how how is it possible to reject someone if you don't know them um it's a good question I I'm I'm just connecting these dots so I'm gonna like think about it and see if I can get you an answer but I think this is something that warrants further explanation I wonder if it has something to do with let me just think I think it has to probably do with the differential interpretation of one interaction so if I ask someone to hang out and they say no the reasons they say no could have nothing to do with me yeah right but I think especially men are raised in a way where a no results in like lower status like so if I'm a dude and I ask out a girl and she says no none of my friends care about the nuance they don't care that she's a lesbian or they don't care that she's not interested in dating or she's asexual or you know they they have they don't care what I get judged on is whether they say yes or no and oftentimes when I may judge myself on and because if you kind of think about it right so like also historically men are the ones who are open to being accepted and rejected like even if you think about this idea of proposing so like in that scenario the one who's on Deck to be rejected or accepted is the man like that's a common scenario societally so on deck for acceptance or rejection is men and I hate to do this I'm going to kind of do it but I gotta add a bunch of of caveats here because I hate interjecting animal biology into humans because I think for the most part the human mind is so complex that a lot of like mating Theory doesn't apply like I just don't think that human beings act based on like observations of like animal mating patterns but if you look at a lot of animal situations and humans are not different where frequently it is the man it is the male who will be accepted or rejected and I think that for a lot of the manosphere like they read way too much into this and they don't really appreciate that women have it's not like high value men and low value men like women are thinking human beings that can mentalize and have complex internal environments and who they choose to engage in a relationship with has way more than height and how much money they has and there's actually overwhelming biological evidence to support that point because the truth of the matter is that most women who in most people who have relationships and will procreate are average they're not exceptional which means that average dudes are getting laid and having families and having fulfilling lives all the time this whole hypothesis that oh it's only the high value males that procreate that's actually like factually very incorrect okay I think I gotta go hi sweetie I'll be there in a second okay can you go close the door okay well okay everyone stay on camera give me give me two minutes Daddy's trying to make the world a better place for y'all when y'all are like 10 years older um anyway so I I think it's it's interesting and it's a beautiful question Anita I wish I had a better answer for you that's the best I can come up with at short notice I wouldn't trust that answer I'm not putting my money down on it but there's something about this whole idea of proposing where I think like acceptance or rejection is it's sort of like the male part of the dynamic which is sort of false because the woman also I'm a woman who initiates I'm a woman who will only date a man that I've asked out I don't accept offers like I don't I've never said yes to someone who's asked me out I only ever ask someone else out and um I laid that down from my friends I'm like if I've never asked you out I'm not attracted to you I don't like being hit on whatsoever and a lot of them crossed my boundary and hit on me anyway and justify it by saying I know I didn't listen to you but traditionally a man has to offer and I'm like to find out and I've already said you've found out if I've never expressed an interest in you that I'm not interested in you so like I feel like where there's a disconnect here is that I don't feel like I've rejected someone for anything if I don't have time to talk to them or I don't know whether it's safe to stop to them in this alley and I feel like I've not made a judgment of you because I don't know you yeah and so I haven't rejected you but you might feel rejected and you might feel the consequences of other people perceiving you as someone who's been rejected and that I am being held responsible for that even though so that might not actually be the case because I don't know you I didn't make any assumptions based on you whatsoever you've not been rejected by me because I know nothing about you I haven't pushed out anything about you I just couldn't stop for a chat and so I couldn't give you a window to hit on me yeah I can a window to try anything and I don't owe your window to try anything either like this idea that I've rejected you if I don't give you an opportunity to apply for a role in my life but I never even advertised like that's not really rejection either like maybe I just don't want to be hit on right now or like maybe it is I just don't date people like you specifically but then that's not actually a measurement of you that's a measurement of my standards and my life and what I'm doing right now and still you can't really take that personally like I wouldn't take that personally as someone who has put myself out there for rejection like I and I do get rejected I don't take rejection that personally and I don't see it as a measure of me whether or not this person says yes or no and I feel like I don't know for me that just looks like maturity I feel like that's a place you're supposed to revive at when you're older I don't know I would agree I mean so I agree with a lot of what you're saying so I think your perspective is quite mature I was going to use the word enlightened but I think also that's so this is the tricky thing right is a lot of what you're saying is not the norm so you kind of say okay I don't date people that I don't ask out which is fair like you do you and it's awesome that you've come to a place where you understand you know you've dealt with rejection you've overcome rejection you've developed faith in yourself you don't reject people until you learn who they are and you give them in a sense a fair chance not that anyone deserves that chance or anything like that I think this is where things get really confusing because a lot of the dudes that I've worked with it seems like they're trying to and I think there are problems here even in this thinking you know the standard that you set is quite different from the standard that a lot of people set and I think what a lot of the challenges that something about being a man means that you have to meet other people's standards you don't get to determine your own standards which is exactly what I think needs to happen so the journey that you've gone through is you've like been through a lot of crap and then you've decided through some amount of personal growth and a lot of suffering this is the way that you want to live your life for some reason a lot of people that I work with and this can absolutely be true of of women as well where a lot of women like don't get to determine what kind of Life they want to live they don't get to the self-determination is not an option for them and that's true for a lot of men as well whereas like I don't get to choose what makes me happy my value is determined by my acceptance of other people by other people's acceptance of me and that's a that's a story that especially boys get fed from day one right like so I a lot of this is making sense to me I think your your views are perfectly valid I think it's great that you feel that way and I'm also beginning to see how it could be hard for you to empathize with these people because I think you've come to a place that is foreign to them but anyway and and this is where I've seen women who are like this too where like you know their value is based on meeting some kind of external metric like the number of children I have or like you know being prom queen or like whatever there are lots of women who are have those kinds of things and what I've what I think the the fear of rejection comes from people who are raised in that kind of idea that you don't have intrinsic value as a human being who you are doesn't matter it's how you perform how much money do you make how tall are you what's your body count when you express interest in someone do they say yes or no your value as a man depends on these variables and I think that that's harmful like and I think that's harmful too yeah and I try to be the kind of friend I don't rate any of my male friends by whether or not they get laid or whether or not they've been turned down like I have male friends who struggle things like social cues um have been virgins their whole life and I think they're cool as [ __ ] and I don't measure them by their sexuality whatsoever and I have friends who are sex workers who've mated with thousands of people and I don't care whatsoever like sometimes it's really interesting to hear about their life stories and the things they've experienced but like neither of these ends of the spectrum mean anything to me in terms of their value and so it's so alien to me that people are walking up to me thinking like if they come up to me and they're scared of rejection because like they I they think that I designate their value that that's my responsibility that whether I say yes or no or it's harmed or not defines everything about them that's that's such a beautiful point right so I think that the experience of women in this situation I'm generalizing here but is that once again so if a man thinks that their value and they've been conditioned to believe that right because there are a lot of men and women who will judge them based on these things and now what happens is it's terrifying because your value as a human being now becomes not part of your own agency but how you were treated by others and then what happens is they put the pressure on the women to accept me because if you accept me I'm worth something if you don't accept me I am worth nothing and that's not a fair responsibility to put on the what like and this is how we get to if you break up with me I'ma kill myself right that our value becomes tied into how people treat us and I've seen that a ton too and so this is I I just need to sleep on this because I this is I've learned so much today and I want the opportunity to try to give you a better answer to what is I think a very important question I love I've learned a lot from you today and I really loved the discussion I feel like it got into like a whole other direction than I expected but I enjoyed it and I don't want to hold you anymore because I feel like you've got places to be and things to do um but I really appreciate being invited on today and talking about all of this I hope we get to talk again because yeah I know I always grow every time that's the same I I think I think you do just such a good job of articulating a lot of people will talk about this stuff but I feel like the way you put it together really helps me understand a lot about people what people's experiences are um and I I do have I I got stuff to do and um but I want to thank you from the bottom of my heart for coming on today I know that this this even this kind of discussion can Garner a lot of like unpleasantness um and this is where once again I think there's a gender Dynamic here where I think the amount of toxicity that you may be opening yourself up to by having this conversation is probably different from what I'm opening myself up to uh and and I mean what I said earlier even though I was kind of saying it jokingly that I have two daughters and they're entering this world and I'm scared for the world that they're coming into and I think that there's like a lot of dangerous directions of like where gender Dynamics is going and my hope is that more conversations like this will make things better for men and women both so thank you very much from the bottom of my heart and I hope you don't get Flack or you know hate are you still can I raid you are you I I decided not to stream this one I am but like uh thank you for the offer and feel free to rate somebody who uh who should I rate can you please tell me okay uh how about um how about any future Annie fuchsia a-n-n-i-e-f-u-c-h-s-i-a she's really lovely okay let's do it so thank you very much Anita take care have a good evening night adios bye everyone bye
