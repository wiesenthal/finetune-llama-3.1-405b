this job sucks and then you go to the next job and you're like that job sucks you go to the next job and you're like that job sucks you don't like it just all sucks so like what do you do in that situation how to not be miserable at job just entering the workforce and all and it's hard not working these random odd jobs i don't enjoy whatsoever the current job i'm working at i absolutely despise i know plenty of people there who make it worthwhile i always work my hardest to get done so at the end of the day i feel like i have achieved something but i still can't help but feeling miserable does anyone have any tips on how to tolerate the job better so like i said a a minute ago originally i wasn't gonna pick this post because i thought that okay this is like so general we don't know anything about where this person is working we don't really know like you know what their work situation is we don't know anything about their colleagues we don't know anything about their upbringing we don't know anything about anything they're like i started working recently i don't enjoy it anyone have tips and so it occurred to me though that like we actually don't need all of that information like if we get a general question we can actually answer in a general way right so what i'd love to do today is actually share with you all some information like general information about how to not be miserable at your job so everything that we're going to talk about today is it may not apply to everyone right so the more you relate to this maybe some stuff will will stick some stuff which is actually okay but it's kind of interesting because we as a society don't really teach people how to enjoy their work we don't teach people what is the nature of happiness we don't teach people what is the nature of enjoyment we don't teach people what is the nature of contentment what is the nature of suffering and the cool thing is that if we sort of like i don't know if this makes sense but we always kind of assume that the suffering is within the job right that like oh like you just keep on randomly like moving jobs until you find the right one that you enjoy and once you find the right job then you'll be happy that's true to a certain extent but like we don't really teach people okay how do you go about finding the right job how do you go about actually like enjoying your job is there any component in the person job relationship that actually like where is it just the job or is there any part of that that comes from you and i think as we kind of tunnel down into that we're gonna learn a little bit about how to be not miserable at our job because it's tricky right so like this person is entering the workforce and like working these random odd jobs and you could be in the same kind of situation where it's like you don't have a career yet but you're just like kind of randomly working jobs and you're kind of miserable and so what you do is you move from like job to job to job you're like this job sucks and then you go to the next job and you're like that job sucks you go to the next job and you're like that job sucks and you go from sucky job to sucky job to sucky job and at the end of the day like you don't like it just all sucks so like what do you do in that situation is this the kind of thing where you have to become like an inner zen master and you have to like learn how to tolerate your job is it like finding the right job is it like learning detachment like what what do we do here okay so the other thing is in terms of the zen stuff what some people may think is that at some point what i'm going to do is share with them some kind of like secret detachment technique i'm going to be like oh like learn to detach if you detach and you understand the nature of happiness right what i just said if you learn this secret technique the secret jutsu then you will enjoy the job and so the tricky thing also happens where if we sort of assume that right if i say okay there is a component that's you then it kind of like it doubles your misery because you're like oh like look at all these other people able to enjoy jobs it's not the job it's me i'm the idiot that doesn't know how to do the job i can't detach enough i don't know how to how to squeeze water out of a stone idiot me and so there's a part so there's a funny thing here where there is a personal component but unless we're careful we'll slip into some amount of self-blame right and then like this is something the boomer generation will sort of say this they'll be like you know i don't know why you're complaining back in my day we had to walk five miles in the snow to take out the trash and this and that and all this kind of stuff they're like we don't know why you're complaining and so it's kind of tricky because this is like is this the problem in you or is this the problem in the job and if you sort of adopt this idea that like oh if i detach myself enough then like oh i'll be fine then it's like a personal deficiency and then you're like oh like you know i guess i'm bad at this but like what if the job is just bad right what if it isn't a personal deficiency so navigating this kind of stuff and at the end of the day if the situation is like i'm miserable at my job what do i do about it does anyone have tips it turns out that we do have tips okay so first thing that we've got to understand is where misery comes from okay so if we understand like what the nature of misery is and we understand what we will like about our job what we won't like about our job as we start to tunnel down into the relationship between me and my job we'll start to really get a good sense of like how to be less miserable at the job so oftentimes what people will do is they'll move from job to job to job and they'll kind of like do it randomly right i don't like this job therefore i'm gonna just let me try something else else like even if we look at this post for a second what this person is saying is i absolutely despise this job so they're gonna look for anything else the problem is that when you jump to anything else your ship is sinking so without really thinking about it you just jump to the next sinking ship and then that ship is is prone to sync as well and then you're like man it's just sinking ships after sinking ships after sinking ships so this is where we've got to be a little bit careful about what is the nature of misery in our job what is it about the job that all that will make it that makes it miserable for us so we've got to sort of understand that so let's start with a couple of thoughts that people in miserable jobs have and also sort of how to counter those thoughts okay so what we're going to do with you all now is actually go through seven different kind of tips to help you kind of manage your uh a bad job okay so what we've got to do is understand what is the nature of misery and what makes us miserable miserable in the job and if we understand what makes us miserable we can sort of start to understand how to move to the next job in a better way okay so the first thought that we tend to have when we're miserable is it'll last forever so this is kind of interesting right so generally speaking when human beings are suffering in some way there's an assumption that pain will last forever this is absolutely a cognitive bias there's all kinds of studies that have been done on this kind of principle that shows that pain gives people a sense of infinite time so when we're struggling when we're feeling nauseous it feels like this is going to last forever so this kind of has an interesting effect when you're in the in a job situation because if you're miserable at your job and then if it if you think it's going to last forever that's going to just go ahead and reinforce the misery right whereas what i would kind of say is that the road to a good job is paved with crappy jobs so the first thing to understand is that even if you have a bad job first of all it won't last forever and also if you pay attention properly each crappy job that you have will actually set you up for a better job down the road okay so this is sort of like the price of tuition so it's okay to notice this thought to acknowledge this thought and to think okay this is gonna last forever and as we'll show you down the road like first of all just acknowledge that you feel that way that'll start to reduce the feeling a little bit and then start to also recognize that this is sort of the price that you pay for eventually finding a good job because even if you are in a job that you don't enjoy at least you now know some element of what you don't enjoy so the next time you find a job you know specifically the kinds of things not to look for to avoid actually right so there are particular things that make you miserable so related to this when we're miserable we have a second kind of thought second thought that we have is there is no point to this so this is where we kind of think about this idea of a dead end job so when we're miserable we don't see any point to the work we're doing we're like who on earth would value this on a resume i don't understand like you know how this can help me in any way shape or form this too is misery creates this thought and then the more that we wallow in that thought the more misery it creates so we've got to do is break both of these cycles to be less miserable at the job how do we break these cycles we start by becoming aware and then we start to hopefully like as you become aware like take a step back do some kind of meditation technique you know like decompress that emotion and then what we want to do is start to like like think critically about this so don't think so black and white start to think in shades of of gray and then eventually as we think critically about it we can start to think constructively and we'll get to what that means down in a minute but when we sort of say there's no point what we're going to also recognize is that this job is actually valuable experience it's valuable experience for you because once again we're going to teach you this in a second you can use this job to sort of figure out okay what is it what is it that's actually making miserable and how do i avoid this in the future because oftentimes what happens is we as we just randomly move from job to job we're not thinking a little we're not thinking critically about what did i dislike in this job that makes that i should be careful about in the next job you also see this in people who get into bad relationships over and over and over again they're like okay this relationship sucks so let me just like peace out of this they ghost but they don't even really think at all about okay what made that relationship bad what was my contribution to that relationship and so we tend to see in relationships as people will get into the same cycles over and over and over again or it'll be same relationships over and over again it'll become a cycle you'll see this a lot with people who are codependent too right so like i'm i'm dependent you're dependent we're codependent together we end up breaking up after a miserable six years and i fall right back into a codependent relationship so you have to have awareness of the cycle in order to break it then start to think critically about okay like is there really no point to this like why do i think there's no point to this what do i do about it and then what we're going to try to figure out is how they're actually there is a point to this so this is valuable experience for a couple of reasons you may say okay it's not valuable experience like who cares that i was packing boxes for like six months this looks great on a resume because you showed up every day for six months and like if you're interviewing with someone at a job and they're like okay what did you do and you're like yeah i packed boxes for six months and they're like oh that's interesting can you tell me did you know why are you leaving and it's i found it boring they're like oh that's you know that's a weird thing to say during an interview and you're like yeah i know it's like i didn't find it very intellectually engaging but you know i told my boss that i would be there on time so i showed up every day and even though i found it boring like i had committed to do it so i did the best job that i could i you know i worked really hard my bosses were super happy with me i'm really looking for something that will reward my hard work and that i can find like a little bit more intellectually challenging i'm a reliable person i'll do work if you tell me to do something i'm gonna do it if i put my mind to it i'm gonna do a good job that's what you can count on from me even saying something like that if you've been doing media labor for six six months like showing up every day and doing something is actually like a very very valuable skill right a lot of people like they don't even show up like showing up is half the battle when it comes to a job so there is valuable experience there so this idea that there's no point and that this is a dead end job this is something that we've seen a lot in our career coaching program where like you know people think they have dead end jobs but even if you've worked retail for like a year or 18 months and there's no opportunity for growth the fact that you've been a stable and consistent worker for 18 months is actually like a pretty big win right you showed up if you've been working in customer relations you've been dealing with karen's and like all this other kind of stuff right like you're dealing with all these like different people you can say yeah i work well under pressure um you know i i show up i've opened i've closed i've gained increased responsibility like i'm reliable and i'm good at customer service especially because the place that i worked our products really weren't great so people would complain a lot and so i was kind of like i had to manage people as they were complaining about stuff so even a dead-end job that you don't think is valuable can actually be like incredibly valuable as long as you think critically and constructively about it so third thing that we're going to talk about so tips on misery so this is just kind of a tip so it may not get easier but you'll get better at it so if we remember this scenario this person had recently entered the workforce and this is something where human beings like you know the first time that you let's say shoot a basketball you may think to yourself like oh my god like i'm never going to be able to do this any time you start something out you think to yourself that you'll never be able to adapt that it's way too hard and like you know you'll never you just think to yourself i'll never be able to do it human beings are remarkably adaptable right so i i it's interesting i learned this actually on my three-month jail rotation where like these people are in jail and and most people when they come to jail think i will never be able to survive jail i won't be able to stay stuck within these four walls for four years there's no way there's no way but human beings are incredibly adaptable and even after a few a couple of months of despair and stuff like that like most prisoners just adjust because that's what human beings do right so like there's all kinds of adjustment i've worked with people who have had you know physical injuries and disabilities had things like legs amputated and stuff like that and no one thinks that they're going to be able to adjust whereas the truth of the matter is that human beings are incredibly incredibly adaptable so if you're entering the job world and you're thinking to yourself this is terrible this is terrible i hate it i hate it i hate it i'm not saying that you should learn to love it what i'm saying is it's it's a little bit okay because you will learn to adapt we're not saying that you shouldn't strive for more we're not saying that you shouldn't change your job we're going to teach you all that kind of stuff too but have a little bit of faith in yourself in the sense that it may not necessarily get easy the job may not change but you will get better at it so have faith in yourself it'll be okay all right now we're going to get into a lot of the details so the next thing that we need to do is diagnose our misery so i don't mean like clinically we're using that term to find out where your misery comes from so we're going to share with you all is a few dimensions that you can look at that oftentimes contribute to misery which we take for granted the first is do you work with people or not okay so some people hate their job because they have to work with particular co-workers some people hate their job because they're like sitting in a back room and they're like packing boxes all day and there's not another soul in sight so this is really important like is part of your misery due to the kind of people that you work with or the fact that there are people or aren't people because this is something huge that you can sort of select the next job based on so if you're working in a back room and you want some kind of like you know the like environment like the office where there are people like inside jokes and you all like go to the break room and like hang out a little bit and like the other kinds of like you know petty office politics like if you want that kind of stuff then you know to look for that next time around so the next time when you're looking for a job you're not going to take the first thing that comes along because you need to leave your job you can start to think a little bit about okay do i want to work with people or not next thing to kind of think a little bit about is what is the boss like is the boss hands-on most people may think oh my god hands-on boss that sounds terrible other people or is the boss like completely afk and what are you looking for are you looking for a boss that's going to sort of serve as a little bit more like a mentor is going to help you when you're down because i i've seen both of these people may assume okay hands-on bosses and it's kind of interesting because what you resonate with is going to be will will sort of tell you a lot so if the idea of a hands-on boss is terrifying to you chances are you want more autonomy at work okay so when you're looking for a job you can even ask people like so what's you know what is the can you tell me a little bit about what like what supervision oversight and learning processes am i going to be acting somewhat independently or you know do i work with a team or like what's the kind of environment because even in in places like corner quote debt and jobs these can be very different so are you working the late shift are you working the early shift or like you know what's going on because those can be they can be very very different so you in one the boss may be like boss may work from nine to five but place is open from like four to ten and so do you want to overlap with the boss or not overlap with the boss you can sort of adjust some some of the things there and if your boss is super afk and if you know what i'm talking about you know what i'm talking about these are places where like some people may be terrified by a hands-on boss but some people are terrified of an afk boss where it's like i kind of showed up so i went to a conference recently a youth mental health summit in california and i was talking to someone who is a pediatric pediatric behavioral specialist i think something like that so these people like worked for the state of california and would do like basically like do the social work interventions and they were like completely on their own they go through a two-day training and then they just get sent out into the field and they're like driving like like you show up on day one of your job it's a monday you sit in a classroom for eight hours you go home you show up on tuesday morning you sit in a classroom for eight hours on day three they give you an address and they tell you go here and help this person and you're kind of like left with no oversight so what kind of oversight or boss relationship that you do you wanna fine okay next thing because these are huge sources of misery third you know i guess this is subtopics third thing that we're going to talk about in terms of sources of misery is variety versus consistency so what do you want from your job do you want your job to be like different every day and this is where once again if you're listening to this and you're like who wouldn't want variety like of course i want variety like variety is the spice of life like i don't want to do the same crap over and over and over and over and over again so people who dislike variety or want less variety they don't use the word variety to describe their job the word that they use is chaos because things are so disorganized there's so much variety there's no consistency people are showing up at random times people are leaving at random times stuff doesn't get done work doesn't get a sign like it's it's nothing is organized at all right so people who like variety won't consider that chaos but someone who likes consistency likes routine look i'm happy to work i just want to show up on time i want to do my job i'm happy to do a good job at my job i don't have to worry about i don't want to worry about all this other crap i don't need to worry about all this other crap you guys focus on that crap i'm gonna i'm gonna build my widgets because that's what i enjoy doing so these are the kinds of dimensions that you need to think about so like what is it that makes you miserable at your job is it a particular co-worker is it that your job is too regimented is it that your boss is afk is it that your boss is not afk is your boss micromanaging and also is like remoting into your computer and can control your mouse like a hacker do you like to work with people or do you like to not work with people and i mean these will make huge differences in terms of the misery of your job so if you're leaving then you need to think about these dimensions ahead of time instead of randomly going to another job right oh i didn't like working at wendy's let me go try mcdonald's and then like you're at mcdonald's for a while and you're like okay this sucks maybe i don't like fast food so you go work at a clothing store but actually what you realize is like i don't like working with people and and doing the same crap over and over and over again okay so you have to think about what makes you miserable at the job and as you think about what makes you miserable at the job think critically about it then you can start to shape your future in a in a more positive way okay now next thing diagnose your pleasure so even if you have the worst job on the planet there's a decent chance that there's something about your job that you will like there's something about your job that is actually okay maybe if you've got the worst job on the planet there's nothing who knows but generally speaking even the worst job has some parts that are okay so there's a very simple exercise that you can do to sort of figure out if i ask you this question and you're like you know what do you like about your job and you're like absolutely nothing i hate every single aspect of it that by the way is this black and white thinking right chances are that's that's gonna really mess you up because if you can't even think critically and nuanced about your job you can't even navigate towards the things that you actually enjoy in your job and if you're blind to what you enjoy in your job how on earth are you going to move in the right direction into finding the right career for yourself or finding the right job for yourself and then what happens is you're gonna get stuck in this cycle so i understand that your initial reaction totally fine i don't like anything about my job totally fine i'm so sorry to hear that let me ask you something if i could remove 90 of your job what's the 10 that you would keep if i could get rid of 90 of what you do what's the 10 percent that you would choose to do tell me why tell me a little bit about that what makes you enjoy that because chances are even the the worst job and i've had all kinds of jobs okay i my first job was serving ice cream i've built a photo bioreactor at a biofuel startup i've you know worked as a clinician obviously like as a doctor i've done research at like three different institutions one in india two in the united states i've been a camp counselor like i've done all kinds of crap you know i i'm not saying i have the most diverse job experience i've never been a web developer or anything like that you know but i i've worked a fair number of random jobs before i went to medical school trying to figure out what to do with myself and so in each of those jobs even making ice cream there were certain things that i liked about it which we'll talk about in a second but this is also really important to think about okay what do you like about your job even the 10 that you do like about it and then that way you can sort of you know look for that stuff going forward oh so what i really like about my job is that there's like a you know a couple hours during the day that like i get to kind of be by myself and even though i have to open i've gotta i can turn on my audiobook and i'm listening to an audiobook where i'm like prepping all the food and and chopping and stuff like that and like that's pretty that's actually my favorite part of the day okay so it sounds like you really like some amount of time where there's some amount of autonomy and you know like simple labor that you can do and maybe if you could like listen to an audiobook like okay cool makes sense so you also want to diagnose what you enjoy about your job and then what you can do is gravitate towards that in the next job okay next thing if you're miserable at your job super practical advice jobs are not static huge huge huge mis understanding about jobs so most people when we enter the workforce assume that the job is what we do right so if you're like an 18 year old kid or 22 year old kid or whatever you're at your first job especially because of the power dynamic and stuff you don't think that there's anything about your job that can be changed turns out most jobs can be modified in some way shape or form so i'll give you all just this example i was talking about doing ice cream right so my first job was serving ice cream so i worked at this place called marble slab and so uh the owners it was a you know small town and so the owners like i was serving ice cream and the owners started me off in the afternoon shift because in their experience the afternoon was the busiest and so you got the most tips in the afternoon so most young kids who are looking to make money that's why you get a job right they wanted to work in the afternoon and that that way you made the most tips and so if you're working one hour instead of getting paid i think i got paid i want to say like maybe uh maybe five dollars an hour or something when i was working i don't remember exactly what minimum wage was it's minimum wage plus tips and so i started off working in the afternoon and it was like me and like one other person we like split the tips and so i'd make like a couple more bucks an hour you know i'd make like eight bucks an hour instead of like 5 25 or or whatever and so they just sort of assume that that's because that's what most of the young kids did it's busy owner would come in early in the morning they would open up and then you know they would kind of go home like around the time that things got super busy and so that's kind of what was assumed and so i i kind of like i didn't really like working during the busy times i found that the actual money that i got was not that much more people were cheap tippers i didn't always get eight bucks an hour sometimes it was like you know 625 instead of five bucks an hour or something like that so the tips like i'd work for eight hours and i'd make like maybe like somewhere between five and ten extra dollars for eight hours of my time which i just didn't feel like was a good use of my time so i asked the boss i was like okay so like you know is there any way i could like open you know and the boss is like sure i mean like you have to learn some things and i like okay please god teach me something like let me at least learn how to make ice cream like that's pretty cool like let me learn how to make ice cream yeah let me like i'd love to learn how to make ice cream i already know how to make the waffle cones because we have to do that as we run out i'd love to tell around to make ice cream it turns out that if you work at an ice cream place making ice cream isn't that hard they've got a machine you put in a bunch of cream you add some flavor chop up some strawberries and toss it in there turn the machine on and then empty the machine into a thing and then stick it in a freezer and then you move it from one freezer to the next freezer it's pretty cool like i made ice cream and so what i really loved is like opening actually the boss is like fantastic like okay so wait so now that this kid is opening i don't even have to come to work until like noon boss loves that kid is gonna you have to accept deliveries you've got to make the ice cream you got to open you've got to get everything ready you're gonna have to show up two hours before we open up and i'm like great because then what happened is like i started getting really good at i was like all right cool so like i'm showing up two hours before opening because i have to do all this kind of stuff and like the boss would also do bookkeeping and stuff during that time right so i got super efficient at it would start my making my ice cream would accept my deliveries or whatnot i'd pull out a book and i'd read for like half an hour here half an hour there i'm getting paid for that like that's great i'd make some waffle cones you know and then like things would open up and things were like pretty quiet like you know the store would open up i'd show up at eight place would open at ten who gets ice cream at like 10 a.m on a weekday like not that many people i get a customer like one customer every half hour so most of the time i'm just kind of like sitting on my ass which is fantastic so this was way better and then things start to get busy around i'd work from like eight to three or eight to four so i'd be like super busy for one hour between three and four make a couple of tips and then at the end of the day you know i'd go home my point here is that if you ask you can actually adjust some things of your job i'm not saying that you can necessarily adjust everything okay not saying that you can dictate what you want to do but you can ask and you can actually change a couple of dimensions of your job and you can make your experience way better so if there's a particular part of your job that you don't like i wouldn't frame it as hey can i not do this so generally speaking bosses don't like that so a more practical tip here is to ask you know talk to your bosses a little bit about hey like i'm interested in learning more stuff or what is the morning shift like or like you know try to be doing some like be wanting to learn something as opposed to avoiding something but the same difference right so you can say oh i love to learn how to make ice cream like that sounds pretty cool can you tell me about opening the back of my eye i'm like i don't like dealing with customers right so there are modifications you can make if you ask and if you ask nicely very important tip under under appreciated for people who are starting out last thing that i'm going to share with y'all is don't suffer alone so there's a lot of research that shows that when we struggle with something and we share it with other people sharing our struggles actually helps us in terms of like managing our emotions and having a positive outlook and things like that so good examples of this is something that we've known for a long time so a lot of times so historically like in in the history of humanity so a lot of times a lot of community came through things like religious organizations right that's a place where people like funerals and things like that like ceremonies where people would pass away there's something healing about suffering with other people or commiserating with other people who are suffering so good examples of this are funerals that take something that's let's just call it an objectively bad experience and soften the blow some other examples of this are things like the you know the sober groups so like alcoholics anonymous narcotics anonymous refuge recovery things like that for people who aren't into the aaa kind of religiosity we can sort of get together and we can talk about things and we can share things and we can sort of like we can feel better right so it's a huge part obviously of things like aoe healing which is what we do so it's on this principle which is by the way very scientifically validated and there's a good example of this stuff like irvine yolum talks about this in his his books on group psychotherapy where he like unpacks what is it that's therapeutic about a group setting and it turns out that it's not some kind of clinical protocol it's the fact that when human beings get together and they share their suffering it sort of alleviates it right this is also why we have a group coaching program by the way so that's like you know we've sort of also figured out that like when you create a space where people can come and share their troubles and you have a coach who facilitates that instead of turning into a cesspool of negativity which is sometimes what happens on the internet which is you'll have these communities that are sort of help seeking communities that can kind of become these toxic cesspools and so how do you share negativity but also as a group work your self out of it and so one of the modifications we made in our group coaching program was that we added a coach right so if you think about an aaa meeting a lot of people there will have experience but it's essentially there's there's no one with formal teaching at all so it's just peers so there's also peer support mental health services which have been studied and stuff like that so the key thing here is that don't suffer alone right so this person kind of mentioned that there are people at work and i know plenty of people there who make it worthwhile so i think this is where when we kind of think about our work situation this person is sort of working alone do you all get that do you feel that from this where they're sort of like working all by themselves and so this is where i'd say reach out to someone and kind of ask someone so if you're starting a new job here's some language right so this is the kind of stuff that a coach would would help you do so because you're like okay how do i reach out to someone no one's taught me how to reach out to someone do i turn to someone who make it worthwhile and then like i absolutely despise this like how do i talk to someone who seems to be enjoying this when i don't really enjoy it right do it how do you say that how do you open up that conversation so here's what i'd say i'd approach that person and say hey um you know it seems like you're really awesome at this job and you also seem to really enjoy it i'm just curious is that the case do you really like like it here then first of all you can sort of you know just ask them a question you can ask them what was it like when you started you know what was your what were your first couple of weeks like right so you can ask them kind of an open-ended question to sort of gauge their sort of experience it's a way to connect with someone at work and they'll say oh yeah first couple weeks are always rough right and you can say yeah i've i really feel in that you know it's it's a lot and then you can even ask hey he's like do you have any tips for someone who's just starting out and they're like absolutely here let me teach you a couple things that will make things easier for you or they'll say yeah it's always rough and then you'll kind of have a laugh about it maybe the next day at work they're like hey hey kid how you doing right so like you can start to form connections and sometimes like we don't even know like the language to open up that conversation because no one ever teaches us this and so this is where sometimes having a little bit of expertise can help right like what do you say to someone at work because they don't teach us the stuff is that some people sort of like they kind of figure it out some people have good modeling and things like that but the key thing here is don't suffer alone so talk to other people at work and and you know this isn't about like you know organizing and putting everything on strike and down with the bosses like i'm not talking i'm just talking about just connect with another person don't suffer alone be like hey this is hard and i mean this is something that i understood really well in residency because residency is hard you're working 80 hours a week you're tired all the time you're not getting paid very much you know we have a saying in in residency that crap rolls downhill and so since you're at the bottom of the totem pole is the intern you have to do all the skutt work so you've got to fill out all the prescriptions and you have to do all the paperwork and stuff like that you have to argue with the insurance company you have to do all the the work the bad work so the cool thing is that when i was in residency most psychiatry residencies do this we had a 90-minute session once a week that was organized by our residency where we would all get together in a room and we would sort of like commiserate around what the experience of being residents in residency was like what do we like about it what do we not like about it what's hard about it that was also facilitated and we were a psychiatry residency so it was facilitated by a psychiatrist um and so like don't suffer alone so i know that oftentimes like you know you'll be in this situation which is like i'm miserable at my job how do i not be miserable at my job and the first instinct may be oh just get a different job the problem is that if you just jump to a different job and you don't really understand why you're miserable in the first place you may just jump to another miserable job and then it's miserable job after miserable job after miserable job after miserable job so if you're looking at okay how do i be less miserable there are actually a couple of general things the first two things we're going to talk about is two particular thoughts which are born of misery but also propagate misery and as we we become aware of those thoughts as we think about them critically as we sort of shape our thinking we can start to be a little bit more constructive even about our job experience and if we have this thought there's no point no actually there's there's some valuable experience here there's there's actually a lot of like good stuff like i'm really glad i worked you know serving ice cream so like that taught me a lot about what to appreciate about my future jobs and what to look for it also taught me that i like autonomy at work like i like to be sort of left alone and do my own thing i don't want someone breathing over my my neck so another thing to keep in mind is that especially if you're early on it may not get easy but you'll get better at it right so if we think about a classic rpg you start off fighting level one mobs and then does the mob become a level zero mob and then the future mobs become level negative one level negative five level negative 50 no you level up you get better at it it doesn't necessarily get easier even now i'm not sure that my life today is easier than even it was in residency there's a lot of stuff that made my life really easy in residency even though i was working a ton so you'll get better at it so have some faith in yourself next thing is we talk about this sort of um thinking critically what does that mean that means diagnosing the source of your misery in the source of your pleasure if there's any at work and so the next time you look for a job start to think a little bit about okay like what do i want to move towards like what do i need to move into what do i want to avoid for my next job and then what's going to happen is you don't like job number one but then job number two you've got two choices right you can get a circle or you can get a square and you're like oh you know what i definitely don't want a circle okay let me try a square okay well now i've got two choices i've got circle over here i could always go back to a circle i've got a square over here or i can get a triangle let me try a triangle oh actually this is pretty good now i've got this kind of triangle right an isosceles triangle or an equilateral triangle okay like let me try the isosceles triangle right but this doesn't happen if you're just mindlessly jumping from one job to another so you have to think a little bit about okay what are the dimensions of this job that make it miserable what are the dimensions of this job that i enjoy another thing that they don't really tell you is that a lot of jobs are actually flexible if you ask politely and there's some flexibility your boss may actually accommodate you and so jobs are not necessarily static so you may be able to you know swap work with someone you can say hey i actually don't mind like cleaning but i really don't like working with customers so how about i do all the you know i do all the mopping and sweeping and you man the front for a little bit and maybe if you don't like customers you can do that the last thing is that we know to not suffer alone a ton of research that shows that commiserating with our our with other people is actually really really important in terms of like forming connections and in terms of reducing misery and this is something that we've seen we've done it in psychiatry training we know it works in group psychotherapy settings we also do this in our group coaching program right where we like share problems but a big part of our group coaching program is we sort of recognize that sharing problems is not enough i mean sometimes it's enough but we also have it facilitated by a coach who sort of will also help you all facilitate accountability and things like that so we have all that kind of stuff baked in there because one of the things that i found that was a little bit unfortunate about group psychotherapy was that there really oftentimes weren't goals right so if you like think about like a group psychotherapy that's oriented towards ptsd i guess the goal is clinical improvement but you know people wouldn't work on a week-to-week basis about okay like if i have ptsd how do i form a healthy relationship going forward right so if i have body dysmorphia how do i develop like a healthy exercise plan oftentimes that component of like accountability and progress was like missing in psychotherapy but this is something that's been very well researched everything from funerals to even our aoe healing all this kind of stuff is really important so if you're at a job and you're miserable don't suffer alone you
