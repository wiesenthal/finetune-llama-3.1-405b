what i find is that people are absolutely herculean with the amount of effort and energy that they put in but if there's something like autism or trauma or depression or something like that in the way you're driving a car with a flat tire if that kind of makes sense hello hello how do i make the the icon bigger uh like okay my face you can click on the face yeah it was fine okay i i yeah can i also turn on my camera you absolutely can we're not gonna share it with stream today because that wasn't the plan unless you really want to which well yeah let's just let's just do i mean you can turn on your camera i'm gonna see it but we're not you know privacy and all that yeah cool hello okay oh my god i'm so much better with cam yeah what do you go by fortunate souls on twitch have no idea yeah yeah my name is clara okay nice to meet you clara how are your friendships going i think at the moment that they're going really good and awesome i don't know can you can you tell us a little bit about how that happened no i mean really for me i think it's come down to being the right people i guess how do you find the right people and remaining open despite rejection remaining open despite rejection that sounds like it's painful advice to follow i'm sorry no no i mean but that's that's you know if that's what it is that's what it is like life ain't life ain't easy sometimes yeah can is that are you comfortable talking about that or you wanted to talk about something else or what i mean i'm actually okay with talking about whatever but um original topic that i wanted to talk about was also about like transactional relationships or transactional friendships can you tell us about that because that i think is really important well it's because okay maybe i will give a little bit of background i guess it was like eight months ago at this point eight months ago i had like a really big falling out with one of my longest friends that i had from high school okay and i still don't entirely know why okay because there were there were a lot of factors to it but one of the things that she was very upset about was that she felt that the relationship was one-sided and in the respect that she was supporting me but for whatever reason she didn't feel like i was supporting her i think it was really that she was he was having a little bit of a you know like a freak out and some like abandonment wounds okay i didn't know how to handle the situation because it's interesting because other people can't see your face but they can definitely hear your size like the yeah uh because i don't know because i can't help but laugh sometimes because i thought it was such a mess tell us about it i mean um if you're comfortable right and we also have to acknowledge that this is your perspective right so there may be another perspective and maybe you're a raging narcissist who's completely unempathic with your friends right so we have to acknowledge that sometimes when we hear stories like this it makes the other person seem really unreasonable but maybe you are the unreasonable one so let's hear you feel comfortable talking about it because i think this is really common where we have long-term friendships and there's people feel like there's a needs mismatch um and so how do we navigate that yeah it's like one question that i had in my mind afterwards was if this was how she really felt about me then why was she ever friends with me in the first place i feel like i've always been this kind of person okay um sorry yeah so um can you tell us a little bit more about the situation do you feel comfortable sharing that or do you think it would be like violating your friend's privacy yeah that's what i'm thinking about um and i can give some details sure the whole saga um sometime around like two years ago i started having like a really hard time um like my mental health deteriorate deteriorated so much and i think that a lot of it had to do with like trauma that i never processed but i didn't realize that that's what it was okay um so i went down the internet rabbit hole of self-diagnosis and and for a year i thought that i was autistic obviously i don't know i say obviously but i do feel like in the end i'm not actually okay um i was having conversations with my high school friend about this and he started thinking that she was autistic too okay and we really bonded over that okay for a period of time at the time i really did feel like mutually supportive relationship okay then when i started to get better because i was like i guess using a lot of your content a lot about processing trauma uh-oh okay got better yeah i got better and one day i told her that i didn't think i was autistic anymore and i told her the reasons and she sent me a couple of paragraphs of a lot of angryness um what was your perception what was she angry about i would i would like to erase it from my mind she was angry about me coming across as narcissistic essentially how so oh again it was a lot of things okay because and like yeah i guess i let my ego out okay i think i don't yeah i shouldn't be so kind to myself i shouldn't be so self-compassionate and say my perspective no well so so hold on a second so and how did you respond to those texts did i respond well it was very confusing because she said i understand if you're angry about this we don't have to talk about this now but it seemed like she really wanted to talk about it now because it was no it seemed urgent so i tried to talk to her about it and like tell her more about my perspective but only made it worse and throughout through the course of the conversation i don't know she she said things like you're the one who wants us to be the same and like if i tried to compliment her i tried to compliment her once where i said like oh you're one of the few people who i felt has ever been able to understand me he took that negatively i'm sorry how so um it was just another like all the i statements you know how when they tell you to use i statements when you talk about your feelings yeah and but then if you use the word i too much it makes you seem like you're very self-absorbed yeah that's what concerns me about when they tell you to do something clara the way that you're talking right now makes me feel this and this and this and i feel this and i feel this and i feel this and i feel this right it yeah yeah so so it's kind of interesting because okay so i can see how that is challenging um let me ask you is this something that has happened with other people yes yes okay and so help help me understand your perception of that you know it was a long time ago again i still don't understand okay but it sounds like it was have so so it doesn't sound so this is like a one-off in terms of recently and it sounds like you've made new friends and that this is not would you say this is a common occurrence for you or less so not a common occurrence okay i don't know okay so it's i would like yeah some of mine some of the friends that i have now i mean they they say i've just been unlucky no what do you think about that i am kind of looking for answers i am looking for answers like is it really me is there really something in me that is making other people react this way or has it just been lucky yeah so i i think chances are so generally speaking when we look at things like this chances are it's both right so let's just like take a 5 000 foot view human beings tend to have particular patterns and those particular patterns are going to evoke particular responses and so do you have a contribution to this i think yes does that mean it's your fault i wouldn't quite go that far because sometimes we think that a contribution equals fault right so so like you know let's say i'll give you just kind of an example where like let's say that like i'm very very giving with my money and if friends need money if they're like on hard times i'm very very generous and over time that may attract a particular kind of friend may muddy a particular kind of relationship and what i sort of find myself in the situation where the more generous i am the more lopsided the relationship becomes and the more frustrated my friends feel with me and then i get really confused by that because it's like i'm being really generous like why are you being frustrated with me does that make sense to you at all we're not saying that this is you by the way but does that kind of compute how that could happen and what do you understand from that situation the hypothetical one actually can you repeat that i really kind of spoke out that's totally fine it was actually like not the best situation but let's say i'm financially generous with my friends and over time yeah you know like i get into weird situations where i think like it's kind of weird because the more generous i am like the worse my relationships become and people should respond by like being generous back to me but that doesn't seem to happen does that make sense to you like that how that could happen yeah and and help me understand how that makes sense to you well because people do things for another person they [Music] actually personally understand this perspective but at least i've able to extrapolate that when people do things for other people they form like an unspoken social construct so social contract in their heads that do something for this person then they're going to pay me back yep in the same way well said right so so so it's it's not so the simplified version of this is oh people you're just going to attract people who use you for your money and even if you're if you're that person who's generous that's what you're going to start to think everyone out there is mean everyone out there is trying to take advantage of me but there may be like deeper layers to that which is that when i'm generous is it truly something that's given with no expectation or is there a hidden expectation in my mind that when they don't pay me back i'm like oh hey here's 500 bucks i don't know it's gonna take me a while to pay you back oh no no you never have to pay me back no no no like don't worry about it like we're friends like what's a little bit of money between friends they're like okay fine if you say so i never have to pay you back where's my money you never paid me back person who says i'm the person who takes people's word for it like i'm the person who's like okay then i don't have to pay you back and then they get mad at me and i'm so confused and i'm like what the [ __ ] yeah right okay so maybe it's it's a hypothetical example but it seems like it's resonating so and this is where well i've never done that yeah but who you know who's at fault here right and that's what's really important here is that we tend to when we think about interpersonal relationships we think like i'm at fault or the other person is at fault whereas what i what i'd love it if you could kind of re-conceptualize a little bit is that is this your fault is this you or is it your friend it's neither it's an intersectional result right and that's what i really got i wish i could have some did that to her but i think she was kind of wrapped up in the expectation and i don't know yeah so i'd be careful about that because if you're sort of saying like explain that to her that could be what what turns people off because if you're like oh like you know so so yeah because anyway so let me take a step back so here's a couple of things that i would kind of think about okay let's just think in general so let's say that you've got a friend things are kind of weird like you all are getting along really well you connect over something and by the way connecting over mental health conditions is like one of the deepest forms of connection that you can have with another human being i've seen it so much especially at places like rehabs where like you know addiction and sobriety really brings people together so much romance on inpatient psychiatric units um so it it's a very actually powerful bond right because like conditions relating to mental health are very very isolating and when you find someone who like connects with you on that level it can form a very strong bond i think that the thing that you kind of noticed which i think is an excellent observation is when your friend came at you with this wall of text that you were not like prepared for your response was to try to explain yourself further and what effect did that have terrible yep right you know i didn't want to explain myself further you didn't want to other people want to i don't i don't whatever yeah so so that's where if i can make a recommendation anytime you have a conflict with a friend instead of trying to explain yourself further try to understand them better what do you think about that what that means so yeah so let's like talk through that right so a couple of things so one thing is that some of this stuff could just be like the mother of all projections right where it's like i you wanted us to be the same maybe like she wants you to be the same like you know so sometimes like there's that kind of thing we we don't know so yeah you know but but i think that's the kind of thing where if someone comes at you with something that's very very confusing if it's an attack you're gonna feel defensive if you feel defensive you're gonna want to explain and the more that you explain the less heard the other person is going to feel does that make sense sure so you're saying sure so i get the sense you're not really buying what i'm selling so what's your hesitation oh i just sorry i feel kind of hopeless often about or like able to have conversations with people when there's like a problem what makes you feel hopeless about having conversations around problems i've never been able to solve a problem a friend but i can't think of a single time when i ever succeeded okay so i mean so then it makes a lot of sense that you would feel hopeless and you're skeptical i'm very skeptical sorry that's fine are you getting the sense that you being skeptical is a problem and yeah help me understand why is being skeptical a problem because it confirms how like you know how my social skills must be be the reason why she thought i was autistic in the first place and i don't listen to other people sorry keep going um she was actually the first person who told me that she thought it was autistic okay have you considered actually seeing a clinician about that i did try actually but all of the doc i mean in the people i saw think that you are or something i'm sorry you cut out there okay and by the way you may want to move your mic threshold or switch to push to talk because i think it's sometimes the discord is clipping the very beginning of your your words yeah so so being skeptical isn't okay hmm i guess so what do you think i don't know i think i just spend a lot of time thinking about what other people think about me okay and if other people don't think it's okay then it's not okay i still kind of have that default mode in my brain a little bit yeah so i i think it sounds to me like you're someone who's very thoughtful about your relationships right like you think a lot about how to and that's i imagine it must be really frustrating for you because you spend a lot of time thinking about it it sounds like you're almost feeling kind of hopeless about repairing relationships like you can build relationships but sometimes like when things get bumpy you have a lot of difficulty figuring out how to patch things up and then you spend a lot of time thinking about it but thinking about it doesn't seem to really fix it but all you can so then you're like calculating like you're playing 4d chess and then 5d chess and then 6d chess and no matter how many layers of thinking about it you do it doesn't seem to really help how does that is that pretty accurate i guess so yeah i i just like the phrase 40 chess it's it's kind of accurate yeah right because you're and so i think a lot so here's here's what i'd say clara so first of all i don't think you're hopeless second of all i think it's worthwhile i didn't catch what you said earlier but i think it's worthwhile getting a clinical evaluation about whether you're on the spectrum or whether it is trauma or things like that because irrespective of which one of those things it is both of those things can impact relationships and one of the things that i find the most difficult is that if you do have some kind of diagnosis at play what i find is that people are absolutely herculean with the amount of effort and energy that they put in but if there's something like autism or trauma or depression or something like that in the way then like you're just kind of like you're driving a car with a flat tire if that kind of makes sense i'm not saying you are autistic or that you have trauma or anything like that does that make sense i mean yeah i just i don't think it's really applicable to me so much anymore like i'm trying to live my life as if i'm a normal person and navigating things by just talking about what i need instead of labeling it as anything um yeah yeah i mean i i it sounds to me like you're a normal person and i think vocalizing what your needs are sounds like a very very good thing to do and it also sounds like based on you know my first question which is like you know how are your friendships now it sounds like they're pretty good are you pretty happy with them yeah yeah so what i would kind of go back to is that you know when you run into conflict with someone i would steer clear of some of the i statements and also try to understand people's perspectives a little bit better as opposed to explaining your own what do you think about that i'm sorry i'm still very skeptical good right so what makes you skeptical because it hasn't worked in the past yeah and can you help me understand how you've tried to understand their perspective i'm sorry my my rabbit makes that's noise in the background well i mean that's a rabbit noise is fine okay she's so noisy um okay how did i try to understand people in the past well i mean i usually use all of the like psychology knowledge that i kind of have gleaned over the years um clara do you do you want to understand other people yeah that's kind of the question isn't it i guess so i think i don't okay yes yeah okay so that is very different no no no no this is very very helpful okay so now the the issue is that i so here's what i'm noticing okay you let me know if this is wrong all right so you have a conflict with someone and when your friend like opens up your bad friend you don't care about me do you want to understand her no right no because i just don't think that it's true okay so this is really important right so like if you're using psychology techniques and like so here's what i'm this you're really i commend you clara for putting together putting in so much effort for something that you is not in your heart i'm like right like it's so this is the kind of thing where we can say like oh claire is bad because she doesn't want to repair a friendship but let's acknowledge for a moment how frustrating it is if you've been friends with someone for years and they just and you're like hey like i think i could be autistic and your friend is like hey i think i could be autistic and you're like hey by the way like i've done some searching and stuff i don't think i'm autistic anymore she's like how dare you and then you're like okay well this isn't good right because i should be friends with this person and like oh my god okay so like clearly something is wrong here let me do some research let me go to google school of communication and learn psychology techniques and like communicate with people but i think what's going on here is that you can use all the techniques that you want to but if your heart ain't in it people are going to figure it out and this is the kind of thing where i think it actually kind of starts with you in terms of my guess is that sometimes people say things that catch you really off guard and you think that they're really really unfair and the hurt of that right and this is what happens when people like this isn't just you but like if someone just shows up and is like hey by the way you're a complete ass and then i'm like no i'm not screw you right i don't want to understand there because especially with criticism like we don't want to understand and ask a lot of questions like about how we're a bad person and how we're like you know like we don't want to understand that perspective but i i've been trying to work in that perspective for the past eight months do you want to though i completely agree you're trying remember you get an a plus for effort yeah i just i don't know i just don't really think it i think it's a bit of a dead end like okay can i say this i hope so it comes back it comes back to the transactional friendships thing because tell me about that because like at least oh yeah this is terrible in terms of like energy you know if you have a bunch of friends who are more or less okay with you being the way that you are and then you have like one friend who isn't like what choice are you gonna make in terms of like like bending over backwards to maintain that friendship yeah bending over backwards to maintain the one friendship versus taking the chance of just that things will be all right without them you know yeah i mean do you feel guilty for doing that let me ask you a different question should you feel good no i'm just remembering sorry yeah go ahead i'm remembering that she said that she was done with me so i wasn't actually the one that broke up technically okay but i definitely did want to leave that was that was that was an issue it was like she desperately desperately didn't want me to leave but i kind of want i don't know yeah this sounds kind of confusing but let me let me share this so so sometimes so this is actually really a good point so sometimes we have historical friendships right and as we grow and change those historical friendships are no longer like worth kind of preserving and i think sometimes that's the case what do you think yeah i just don't i don't know i just i just don't know when you make that determination totally but um i mean yeah i'm sure it happens yeah so i i think that what i'm what i'm hearing from you clara is actually a lot of confidence in how you feel about the situation but almost a reluctance to [Music] vocalize it definitely and my guess is that you're concerned about the perception because you know so like this is a problem that like oh like oh my god it's like your friend from high school and y'all have been so close for so long and then she blows up at you one day and you're like yeah i'm done with this [ __ ] but that's not what a good friend does a good friend like listens and tries to understand their perspective and tries to patch up the friendship because the friendship that you have is so strong and you're like yeah i'm done with that [ __ ] is that how you feel yeah yeah yeah so i hope that there's people out there that can relate to this that's kind of my only that's why we're talking i can guarantee you there's a there's tons of people out there because here's the thing no one ever says what you say which is that this relationship is exhausting now i've grown and like i just don't have the bandwidth for this anymore i don't know what don't you know what is that sorry i have a little bit of a cough um no sometimes i just say i don't know because i guess it's because i want to say yes but i'm not sure if i'm allowed to there it is look at that so here's the thing okay okay so now we're going to kind of like wrap up and it's going to be pretty simple first thing is no amount of psychological techniques is going to preserve a friendship that your heart is not in i can see you nodding emphatically yeah so yeah no amount like oh i agree right so like if your heart's not in it and you're like i'm just done with this then like at least acknowledge that for yourself right so that that's number one and so i can understand why you're skeptical because here i'm like oh like clara tried to understand her perspective and you're like yeah i don't think that's gonna work and i completely agree with you because i can give you all the techniques in the world but if your heart ain't in it if you actually don't want to understand her perspective if you're kind of like done with this then like you're done like no amount of techniques is going to fix that now if you're looking for a license from me that that is okay i'll give it to you i'll say yeah that's okay i mean you don't have to i'm i'm in charge of myself for the most part sure but i think i i do think that this is like important because why do you say i don't know it's because you're not allowed societally to say like this relationship is just not worth the energy anymore because that makes you a bad person i don't think it makes you a bad person i think that's a reality of life that we actually like is happening every single day that we just don't admit and then we get into situations like this where people are like trying to make a relationship that neither party wants to be a part of work because i don't want to abandon my friend right and technically she broke up with me right because you you're okay you're in the clear according to the rules i don't like yeah yeah i honestly i wasn't really expecting that from her though i don't know so i i had apologized to her for my part and i thought that's what she wanted but then when i asked her to apologize to me about the thing that she wrote to me she was done i'm sorry so you sound hurt you sound pissed i'm not allowed to hurt dr k i'm the villain i'm the villain sorry so i mean if you feel hurt and you feel pissed right like i i do think there's like there's a lot for you to learn from this situation and at the top of the list is like being aware i mean i think you know what you want i think you just pretend to want something else and like that's not good in a relationship you need authenticity oh god what you're so right now here's why this is important because somewhere along the way you may run into a relationship that you do actually want to preserve and in that if you run into that then then at some point you may need to like work on yourself in terms of understanding why you don't want the relationship especially if it's good for you so i'm especially thinking about something like a serious romantic relationship i know we're talking about friendships today but you know this is the kind of thing where if you're like invested in a romantic relationship and these kinds of feelings come up for you i think it's fine to leave your friend from high school in the past because that just happens people like you're not the same person that you were in high school and what made y'all friends in high school y'all have grown into different people and you know people grow out of friendship in the same way that they grow out of romantic relationships but when a relationship is important to you the one thing that i'd sort of say is that you be really like careful about not convincing yourself that it's no longer important and at the end of the day just really be honest with what you want and you know kind of who you are and i'd say that you know if relationship if you're not happy with the way that your relationships are progressing if you've been concerned about this isn't just about you this is just in general for people right if you're concerned that you could have been on the autism spectrum or that you have social anxiety or trauma related stuff attachment related stuff i think it's really reasonable to go see a clinician and sort of like get that stuff sort of sorted out i mean generally speaking you know i heard you kind of say you know i want to operate as a normal person i think you're a normal person but even if you're autistic that doesn't make you not a normal person right and so it's just something it's it's a lever to be pulled if and when you're kind of unhappy with your journey without it if that kind of makes sense so by all means get as far as you can without clinical evaluation but if at some point you're not happy with things then get clinical evaluation um i wanted to say i wanted to say another thing okay that's vance because yeah you said in terms of romantic relationships and uh oh what was it that you have to be honest about what you want i also am a person who doesn't really want romantic or sexual relationships i think i'm like a rock okay um that's also been a big challenge in my life because it was exactly that thing it was like i got into i got into like a few romantic relationships without realizing that i didn't actually want it in the way that i think it was expected and i spent so much of my time pretending pretending pretending i don't know what to do dr k why do you like to do anything because i have to face the world so and tell the world that i don't want all of these things that normal relational people want so but that's another topic yeah i think that's i mean i think it's related but i do think that that's a different chapter so here's what i'd leave you with so here's what i'm kind of noticing from you and you let me know whether this kind of sinks in so like the world expects things from you clara the older the friendship the more important it is and the more you should care about it we're friends since we're three years old and i can't sacrifice that for anything even if the friend has grown up into a raging narcissist or you have right who knows so it's it's it's okay for a society to have certain expectations of people i think not living up to those expectations is actually okay like i don't think that your value as a human being increases or decreases if you decide that you're just not interested in romance or you're asexual or whatever whatever you know you do you i think the fault lies and the hurt comes from pretending and letting someone else be a part of that fiction yeah yeah yeah right definitely yeah so so i think that's where like if you want to hold some kind of accountability or like you know you don't have to tell the world i mean it's not like you have to walk around with a shirt that says i'm not interested in relationships and that's yeah you know like you could be not in a romantic relationship for the rest of your life and you'll probably have to explain it to someone here or there but you know it's not like most people are just off living their lives yeah and so i'd say be honest with yourself first of all and and even like if you're concerned about the judgment of the world like you know that's understandable right because there are certain expectations and people will judge you and stuff like that but that's where the more centered you are i mean i think your problem actually arises not from telling the world your truth i think your problem arises from pretending it isn't your truth and then trying to play the game of the world and being inauthentic with yourself and then it messes it causes problems because your heart isn't in it and then you're like trying to satisfy the world's expectations what do you think about that yeah so you know sum it up you do you girl i guess so you have female pronouns here but you know it's fine i don't really care that much okay how does it sound to hear that i mean how does it feel to hear that i kind of don't really feel anything like i don't feel relief and i don't feel yeah that's okay i don't know yeah right so but i think you're cool yeah so once again it's like oh my god am i supposed to be feeling relief right now oh i don't think that's why you do you right hopefully it's been helpful and even if it hasn't that's okay like we tried yeah i i hope i i get the sense that you understand things a little bit better than when we started this conversation you know and i i think that a lot of people who are listening probably resonated with what you said yeah cool any uh last thoughts or you know closing remarks before we wrap up no i think i'm good awesome thank you very much for calling in i think it was really important to hear what you had to share okay yeah thank you dr k take care bye yeah so that's how it is sometimes like i thought it was good actually right because this is the sort of situation where like we're supposed to behave a certain way we're supposed to like maintain friendships and we have like all of these like you know we have this like social scoring system in terms of what we're supposed to value and then we run into relationship problems and then like if we're trying to play a game that we don't feel authentic and i know it's like it's kind of weird but clara was really great for sharing one really important authentic feeling which is that i don't think this relationship is worth my time anymore i don't want to go through the effort of understanding why this person is upset with me and does that make you an [ __ ] i don't think so like if it happens over and over and over again and you're leaving like you know dumpster fire after dumpster fire of relationship then maybe it is a problem but i think this is the kind of thing where honestly you're going to create more hurt in the world if you try to be something that you're not as opposed to authentically sort of saying like hey i'm sorry you feel that way i i was taken aback by where this is coming from and you know if you're done with the relationship like that's totally fine by me i am too i really appreciated the time that we've spent together your friendship has meant a lot to me but i think we just seems like we're not really interested in maintaining this which is totally fine i'm grateful for the time that we had i wish you all the best adios and that's okay right and then people would be like i can't believe that you threw it away like you threw it away like had they threw it away yeah it's like i mean throw it away it's sure if that's what you want to call it if you want to blame me for it like that's okay but like people grow and they change and they form new connections and you don't have to hold on to the past just because something was valuable to you in the past doesn't mean that has to be valuable to you in the present we sort of even heard that a little bit in terms of like it sounds like there have been some challenges in the past in terms of trying to pretend to be interested in romantic relationships when you're not so it's okay to be that way it's okay to want to move on from relationships it's okay not to be loyal to things that don't really interest you any anymore right and as you are authentic with people i think that too is like not gonna hurt other people because if you're sort of straight up with people that hey you know like this is just who i am and this is what i'm interested in you kind of give the people the choice to accept it or not accept it the hurt actually comes when you pretend to be something else they opt into that relationship and it turns out that
