is this an issue of this person being like not trusting or is it an issue of this the person that they're dating like not being entirely honest or or whatever there's this idea of or like it's not or it's a combination like if conflict avoidance on on her part plus a lack of trust on your part results in like a lack of communication which is like quite bad do you all get that in the past if your partner has tried to communicate with you and the part of you that feels difficult to trust comes out right and you start getting paranoid you may not like lash out at them in sort of an aggressive way but you may like start to be like super passive where were you what were you doing i'm starting to think i don't respect myself i have a fiance who recently went on a vacation i found out later she was talking to a co-worker the entire time she was gone once she got back she started hanging out with him for five to eight hours at a time while lying to me about where she was even one time overnight i have my own issues with trust and feel like i spend too much time living in my partner's life so i found out about this through checking her location i confronted her with this and she said she felt like she needed some space and always felt watched around me i don't completely deny this because i feel like i have a really hard time trusting and she is a compulsive liar due to her own childhood traumas she said that she is not cheating but talking to this person helps her have conversations to work out her past traumas he has had similar traumas he has overcome and i and that i am emotionally uh closed off not completely true where i'm starting to have issues is that i do somewhat believe her that she is not cheating but let her know that i need openness and honesty if this is going to work she quickly disrespected this by lying about where she was two days later to again talked with this guy for five or so hours i don't know if i am the abuser or the one getting abused is me checking in on where she's at and glancing over her shoulder when she's on the phone causing her to feel a lack of privacy the real issue or am i just getting my boundaries stream rolled by le and letting her lie to me by blaming myself for this i'm starting to get creeping doubts that i don't respect myself enough to enforce my boundaries and enact consequences for when she crosses them like leaving the relationship she doesn't want to lie but has extreme conflict avoidance that makes telling the truth extremely hard one of these things she is trying to fix a recurring thought that i have is that because i have these unhealthy trust issues that i deserve this or that even if i break this off it will just happen in to the next relationship reflecting these two past these past two weeks i believe my invasiveness untrusting nature is what caused my relationship previously to deteriorate and end do i try to work this out with her how do i enforce or communicate my needs of being open and honest to work on my own issues when being open and honest is one of her core issues i want to make it clear that i do not con that i do not condone my behavior even if she does lie i need to work on myself and to not immediately jump to infidelity just because she is talking to someone of the opposite sex this situation has just been a wake-up call that these deep-rooted issues need to be addressed and worked on i think this answered the question right this is fantastic so this is i mean the situation is unfortunate but the first thing that i want to point out is that relationship problems are not usually a me thing or a them thing so we have this kind of idea our mind tells us is me checking on her where sh where she's at and glancing over her shoulder when she's on the phone causing her to feel a lack of privacy or am i getting my bounty stream rolled and letting her lie by blaming blah blah blah right there's this idea of or that is this an issue of this person being like not trusting or is it an issue of this the person that they're dating like not being entirely honest or or whatever like that it's not or it's a combination so this is what i want y'all to understand so like a relationship is not something on you and something on her that's not that's not how it is it's a combination of what each of you bring to the table so i bring a certain set of like thinking and conditions and reasoning and stuff like that and then my partner said brings a another set of stuff up right so and then like these two things blend together and you create something new that is like half from you and half from her now this relationship to me the one thing that i can say is that i don't think that this sounds like a healthy relationship moving in the right direction now some people may say oh just just break up with them other people may say oh no like it's on you no i don't think it's either or so if you're in a relationship where you know you don't trust your partner that can create sort of a situation where if you don't trust them they may paradoxically feel like they have to keep things from you so if she tells you yeah i'm gonna go meet a co-worker of mine and then like that sort of sets you off in some way your partner may decide that the simplest thing to do is just not tell you because then she doesn't have to deal with like your reaction now if you have conflict avoidance there like if conflict avoidance on on her part plus a lack of trust on your part results in like a lack of communication which is like quite bad do you all get that so if i don't trust any lack of communication is gonna like any question mark in the relationship i'm gonna see the worst options so any uncertainty becomes a doomsday scenario for someone who has difficulty trusting on the flip side if someone's conflict avoidant anything negative or positive there's all kinds of stuff that's going to be more question marks because the conflict avoidant person does not want to have a conversation is troubled by the conversation doesn't want to get things out in the open it doesn't even mean that there's anything to hide right it's not necessarily that they're doing something wrong but conflict avoidance leads to a lack of communication a lack of communication leads to question marks and if you have trust issues question marks are going to get translated in your brain as infidelity so this is like absolutely a scenario where these two things are like combining in a terrible way does that make sense so what do you do about the situation the first is that i commend this person for this level of insight where they're like i think the last reason my relationship deteriorated was like a lack of trust and so in the past if your partner has tried to communicate with you and the part of you that feels difficult to trust comes out right and you start getting paranoid you may not like lash out at them in sort of an aggressive way but you may like start to be like super passive where were you what were you doing and even though they say things like you don't believe it and they see that you don't believe it and they see that you're upset and they're conflict avoidant and they don't want to make you upset so they conclude like because even if they weren't doing anything wrong they can't keep you from getting upset because you have trust issues does that make sense because how are they supposed to reassure you if you don't have trust right does that make sense so if they can't reassure you then they start they stop talking to you and then that exacerbates the problem so this is the kind of thing where i would say a couple things first is you should work on this trust issue yourself right this is something that you need to work through if it's a pattern that extends beyond this relationship it's something you should work on yourself second thing is y'all should probably work on this together as well in terms of like you know help me and what you've got to do is be super open-minded so when you sit down with your partner don't try to judge or convince or even share your perspective at all just try to understand your partner's perspective okay and what you want to do is say things like help me understand what makes it difficult for you to tell me when you're hanging out with this person like what am i doing like i'm i'm genuinely trying to understand like can you help help me understand what goes on in your head help me understand how you make the decisions you make i'm not saying they're wrong i just want to try to understand them so that i can like make my peace with it right and listen to what they have to say the other thing is frankly some of this stuff is a little bit sus you know i'm just going to toss that out there like spending the night somewhere and sort of being a little suss about it like that's really kind of weird so you know i think your paranoia is maybe a little bit justified but at the same time like they're just warning signs here right like that's what this is and so just because there's a warning sign doesn't mean that there's a problem yet but this is the kind of thing where i don't think this relationship is heading in the right direction so you need to work on your stuff yourself you probably also need to work on this with your partner but it's not like an either or kind of situation and that's where if you lay a boundary with someone and you don't enforce it all you're really reinforcing is the concept that your boundaries don't need to be respected so if i like tell someone i'm like if you don't call me in the next hour i'm never talking to you again and they call two hours later and i answer the phone what am i reinforcing for that person all i'm reinforcing is that you don't have to respect my boundaries now this is where you got to be a little bit careful because what this may mean is like i'ma teach these people to respect my boundaries if you don't call me the next hour i'm never talking to you again and since they called me two hours later like i ain't answering the phone i'm gonna text them if you you didn't call me in the hour blocked which the other part of this is you can't set stupid boundaries like don't sign yourself up for a stupid boundary that you then have to reinforce you guys get that so never set a boundary when you are emotionally upset like never do that voice your frustration but don't set a boundary boundaries should be set with a clear head with also an understanding of what is actually enforceable like what are you actually gonna do i'm never gonna talk to you again stupid you're not gonna do that so don't say that right and then what happens is like it just creates lots of frustration when you set an unreasonable boundary on someone they don't respect it you don't respect it and then like it just gets frustrating for everyone involved so think carefully about which boundaries you're gonna set and chances are you're gonna set lighter boundaries than you think you deserve which is totally fine boundaries should be set based on enforcement not what should be this is something we talk about a lot in parent coaching we spend 12 weeks teaching parents how to set proper boundaries on their kids and like it works really well once you think a little bit parents are like no playing games after 10 pm are you up after 10 pm are you going to watch the kid and make sure they don't play games after 10 pm no they're just supposed to listen well they're not going to and all you're going to teach them is that they don't have to respect what you say so don't set a boundary for no games after 10 pm but then they're going to play games after tempe yeah so you've got two options either they can play games after 10 pm and not respect what you say or they can play games after 10 pm and you don't set a boundary on them and shoot yourself in the foot that you're not gonna enforce anyway they're going to play games after 10 pm either way it's just do you want them to respect what you say or not you guys get that so don't set boundaries that you're not willing to enforce so as for what to do in this situation i mean i think it's like it's challenging you know because because even what's happening is i'm seeing an emotional wedge being driven between these two people and when you have an emotional wedge and you have someone who gets into the habit of not telling you where they are lying about it or things like that and you have someone who's like habitually paranoid then you're gonna i mean that's where this is where affairs and breakups come from right so like she's got you who's paranoid and looking over her shoulder all the time who she can't emotionally connect with and then she's got this other guy who's available and easy and fun to hang out with and that she emotionally connects with and like where do you think that's going right now that may terrify you but like acknowledge where it's going so that you can alter its course sticking your head in the sand and like ignoring the problem is not going to help it's easy to do that it's easy to like be afraid of what's gonna happen and say like oh like but like don't you know you should when when you create a situation with your partner where you cause them a lot of headache and someone else doesn't that's like a dangerous situation to be in now we're not saying that that entitles your partner to cheat on you hopefully what they would do is break up with you first but that's just kind of how it is right so like the relationships are about people who support each other and care about each other and enjoy each other's company and if that's no longer what the relationship is like you don't necessarily need to hold on to the relationship the other thing to say is that like i was saying this is a combination of two things right so you may just need to be with someone who is more open to communicating and is more able to reassure you and is like more like able to do that emotionally now that could be this person but then she's got to grow into that so this is where like a lot of times what people will sort of assume is that you should be with someone who dot dot dot but like that doesn't mean that you have to break up with your current person and your partner deserves to be with someone who's a little bit more trusting so you can grow each person in a relationship can grow into what the relationship needs in fact that's how it works because if you're dating if you two you are dating you're both 18 you're going to be different people and have different needs at 24 and they're going to be different people have different needs at 30. they're going to be different people and have different needs at 36. so you always have to grow and change into what the relationship needs and when you're sort of committed to the relationship that's what that commitment means it means growing and changing into what the relationship needs you
