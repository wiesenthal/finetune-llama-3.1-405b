hey like we need to we need to go kill baron or the dragon or whatever right like we need to do this we need to do this we need to do this whereas like being an effective communicator especially in a moba i found it's way way better to ask questions instead of telling people what to do hello hi hello friend how are you i'm i'm doing all right how are you i'm doing well today can you tell me what you go by i go by a boss okay welcome a boss this is kind of crazy yeah um yeah i've been watching your content for a long time and it's helped a lot with learning how to listen to people and how to talk to people and notice my own emotions so it's kind of crazy i'm i'm very i'm very happy that it's been helpful to you so how how are your friendships how how's life going in in the world of your friends and things like that so for me uh i'm kind of keeping a lot of long-distance friendships where we mostly talk on discord we my main group of friends we went to high school together and then after college we all moved to all kinds of different states and so to me this problem has shown itself more recently so i've been going through a breakup and that's been a hard time and whenever i bring it up to them they're very supportive of me which is great and reassuring for me but i feel almost guilty bringing it up a lot because we don't have a particularly formal or regular way for talking through our emotions or talking through our days usually we get on discord play league talk about league um or yu-gi-oh or whatever it is that we're playing and so i think i imagine that i wouldn't feel as guilty going to them with my if i'm going through a hard time like oh i'm thinking about her again if they were also if we were all communally talking about our feelings and how we're how we're doing um i'm assuming that this is largely like a guy thing uh i imagine a lot of guys go through this and a lot of guy friendships where you don't really talk about how you feel or tough times and things like that so i was wondering how to introduce more regular ways of talking outside of games absolutely so so let me just make sure i understand your situation it's it's a it's a i'm really glad you're calling in today boss because i think that this is something that a lot of people do struggle with so if i heard you correctly you had a group of irl friends in high school or college and after college i believe you went your separate ways and you all have continued to stay in touch over the internet and discord is that correct and most of the time the nature of your social interaction is like gaming related so you all will hop on y'all will play league yu-gi-oh whatever is that also correct yep and you're going through a breakup you're kind of leaning on them for support it sounds like they're actually supportive but i'm hearing that you feel guilty because it almost sounds kind of one way it's sort of like you know when they are hanging out with you they're not asking for your emotional support you're not supporting them through a breakup you know they're kind of logging on to have fun and when you're kind of logging on and you reach out for support like it's it's kind of one way in terms of how the support goes yeah i've been trying to kind of load balance as weird as that sounds you know one time i'll have i'll go through a hard time i'll text one friend and then i'll i'll keep a rotation of friends of you know four or five people to talk to so that way it's not like an everyday thing or an every week thing for the same person so what are you trying to accomplish by load balancing uh i'm trying to not to not overbear one person with all of my for me i'm going through a sad time right so i don't want to have the same person feel like they have to support me okay and i feel like it would be easier for the group all together if it's multiple people supporting each other okay so all right so let's let's understand this problem so you feel guilty right yeah and the reason that you feel guilty is because there's one way of support like one way it's a one-way road yeah and since it's one way what you're sort of doing is is you don't want too much traffic down that road so what you're kind of doing is creating five different one-way streets with five different friends so that you're kind of balancing the load of them supporting you yes and then you're also kind of noticing that maybe it's a masculine thing maybe it isn't but definitely in your case and in your friend in your particular group you struggle to sort of understand how to like broach the topic of like how do we talk more about things that are not gaming right exactly and so unrelated yeah it helped for me to turn on my camera just like eye contact wise or uh it's your choice so i'm not gonna stream you um i turn on my camera on discord so that you don't see the stream delay yeah i just it feels weird i i have a personal hard time talking with people if like they don't have their cameras on you're welcome to turn it on i can i can uh and then i'll i'll move things over i just don't want to leak you accidentally that's all good okay so i just can't yeah so oh man this is so much nicer right yeah we should think about next time you know if people are comfortable showing their face then everyone can enjoy because you're it's a check seeing your face makes me feel so much more connected to you yeah it feels so much easier than just talking to uh my discord avi is cloudy and smoke ball you know just a random yeah so i i want you to i want to ask you a boss what did you just do just now by sort of asking if you wanted me to if you if i wanted you to turn on your camera what did you just do there it's great um i wanted to make eye contact so i asked you if that was cool with you okay that's pretty cool right so i somehow don't have a hard time asking strangers for favors and questions yeah do you have a hard time asking your friends for favors oh yeah how do you understand that um so in in high school i noticed this a lot where uh i was in i started joining theater things in high school and it's a lot harder to perform in front of friends than it is in front of strangers um it's a lot harder to ask like if a stranger sees me drop a book and they pick it up for me i'm like all right thanks move on but if my friend does it i feel like oh my god i do this every time uh or if i feel sad and i reach out to them i'm like oh man i'm being sad again um i feel like it's too much i'm noticing that you have a a problem owing your friends things balance with your friendship sounds very important to you yeah um i i view it more as me being guilty i feel guilty a lot what are you guilty of oh so many things um i'm guilty of not doing a good job at work i'm guilty of not reaching out to friends first a lot of times they'll reach out to me i'm guilty of asking people for things and then like a lot of times i'll call people be like hey uh do you remember that show you watched do you recommend it okay cool bye and that's it so you're just you're getting something from them but you're not giving anything in return yeah that's the impression i i get um they haven't said that to me but that is i don't know i'm trying not to do that anymore okay have you ever asked no uh i just recognized from one person one friend has been like hey wait hold on how are you doing i haven't seen you in six months what's going on um and that's only happened once uh but yeah i feel guilty about a lot of things i see that so there's so let's let's kind of talk through this uh in a couple of different ways so the first is that it does seem like you're a little bit prone to feeling guilty and and i'm sort of noticing almost this pattern where if you've got a relationship this didn't quite resonate with you but this is sort of what i heard and i'm sure there's more nuance to it but that like like this one way traffic thing seems to bother you a lot so if your friend like picks up a book for you in a sense it almost seems like i mean everyone drops books but i imagine you would feel more comfortable if if they helped you out with something if you were able to help them out with something oh yeah oh yeah definitely and then also it's kind of like with this this whole thing about oh hey is that show good like thanks a lot okay thanks bye you know so you're getting something from them and you're not giving anything in return and so i think there are a couple of things that we can sort of give you kind of very concrete kind of suggestions for you to sort of think about and see what you feel comfortable with about how to change the dynamic of your friend group but i think a lot of this comes down to something kind of simple which is that i'm noticing that a lot of your guilt or a lot of your mistakes are actually not signaled to you by your friends no they're actually like from here yes right what do you think about that um i think it's overall a mechanism that serves me well to treat people well and to um i think where i got it from was i had a family friend who for context i'm a muslim so he would say that at the day of judgment you know god essentially presents you a book of all the things you've done and you have to review it and the guy mentioned how people who keep a journal of the things they've done in this life even before the day of judgment their process is quicker i don't know why i thought it would be a good idea to do but i started doing it mentally like this is how i did well this is what i did could have done better um yeah and so i i start keeping track of all the things i do and all the mistakes i make and all the things i need to improve on do you think you were doing that before your friend shared that with you i might have but this was probably eight years ago so it's hard for me to remember that okay so um abbas i'm gonna share some thoughts with you but let's start by kind of organizing so i think there's like two or three different layers to this um yeah i i got off track my bad no no it's it's good i mean that's how humans work right so human beings are complex and your answer or solution isn't going to be simple did you just make another mistake did we just add something to the book yeah like even even with therapy i i go in and i plan out the story of like this is how my week went this is all the things i want to cover and then my therapist is like let's talk about that when i'm only five minutes into the story and then i i leave the session thinking oh man i forgot all these things to talk about i didn't do all this and yeah yeah so so you you perceived yourself as making a mistake now something has been written in the book of judgment that yes oh abbas is supposed to talk about his friendships and here he is talking about his guilt and his spirituality in the way that his mind works oh no yeah right so you do you think you made a mistake there um i didn't follow through with my intention so yeah yeah so look at my face do i think you made a mistake no i don't think so but it weighs on me anyway weighs on you anyway what weighs on you um that i didn't follow through with my intent that i deviated from the prompt okay so i personally found it useful that you shared that stuff what do you think about that i feel concerned um because if i'm already deviating this far in um then if i keep talking i'll keep giving more context and then i'll deviate even further and then it's like how do i explain 22 years of my thought processes uh how do i'm 20 22 years of my thought processes in half an hour i can't and then it's like ah it becomes too much okay so you believe you made a mistake yes i don't believe you made a mistake that's nice right so we're agreeing to disagree there yeah i see that so now now here's my concern is like you're talking about a relationship right like a relationship with your friends and right now so i'm let's say i try to reassure you and i say bro it's not it's really not a problem i'll explain why in a second but you have you you play wall right so like you have reassurance resistance so like as i try to reassure you like you have you're resistant to that so 90 of that reassurance you block you know because you got you tank it up and what does that mean for you and your friendships and your guilt uh i play league like it's a single player game and i think it applies here as well beautiful how uh i learned if i want to climb in league i was watching ls who's a big coach and he says it doesn't matter what the other team with your your other teammates do you can only fix what you've done and i think okay yeah i you know i didn't look at the mini map that's on me my bad and so even though there's a lot of information to take and there's a lot of different routes and everybody's going to make mistakes it's my fault and so even if my teammate carries if i had a bad game i had a bad game even if they brought it through and we still won and we had fun whatever but i still didn't look at the mini-map i still didn't track everything i didn't do everything i could yeah so i've heard this a lot so this is maybe a little sneak preview so i've been doing a secret experiment outside of creating content and and i play more dota than league and i know this sounds kind of weird but everyone sort of says if you want to climb in a multiplayer game just play it like a single player game like you can't rely on your teammates you can't you know it's just a single-player game there just happen to be like bots street people like bots and that's the best way to climb so i know this sounds kind of weird but i think that that's absolutely idiotic because it's a multiplayer game so i did this experiment and hopefully we'll make a youtube video about it at some work it's a lot of work where i have i had two accounts and i calibrated it so this is dota so i don't know if this works out perfectly in league but i calibrated on both accounts just me like playing on both accounts simultaneously and the only difference is in one account i communicated with my team and in the other account i just muted everyone and didn't talk at all and the mmr difference between the two i don't know how this translates into league maybe someone in chat can help us out is about a thousand mmr which is like pretty big like it's huge and i know it sounds kind of weird but like in a multiplayer game when you actually communicate effectively and i think the reason that people say don't communicate in multiplayer games is because we don't actually work on communication the way that we do on like last hitting or rotating or clicking buttons or things like that communication is a skill yeah absolutely and the reason that people say mute people is because we don't know how to communicate with our team effectively yeah this is somewhat related but like i realize um i learned over the course of the last relationship that you know if i'm listening i can't do anything else i have to like focus 100 and i've had to work on communication exactly like everything else where like you taught in one of your videos if you want to listen to somebody repeat back what they said and so that was something i had to build like all the other skills yeah so so i think if we kind of come back to your your interpersonal relationships i'm noticing that like i mean you said it beautifully that you play it the same way you play league which is like like a single-player game like you don't so so here's what we're gonna do so here's how i'm kind of understanding your situation so on the one level there's some stuff that is actually a single-player kind of quest so your propensity towards guilt your kind of spiritual perspective which kind of i can't tell if that i want to say you're sort of misinterpreting something there in terms of the religion of islam but i'm not an expert in islam and you're the muslim so like if that's you know i'm not either so but you know something tells me that sometimes what happens is we have religious or spiritual traditions that intersect with particular vulnerabilities in our psychology and then what happens is instead of like recognizing this as a problem within me that i'm prone to guilt and instead of like working on that in sort of a healthy way sometimes what happens is religion will come in and say no no you're not prone to guilt that's not a problem you should fix that's part of the religion you need to be guiltier and it'll kind of reinforce it and in my experience like sometimes that can be unhealthy i'm not saying that religion is bad i think it's you know there are vulnerabilities in our psychology that can be exacerbated by all kinds of external influences whether they be friends family religion philosophy like you know people can sort of get into nihilism and and stuff like that in a very unhealthy way so that's just kind of the the personal piece and then i want to talk a little bit about the interpersonal piece so very concretely if we kind of go back to the core issue it's that you just play league with your friends and you're kind of leaning on them for emotional support so this is where i would really encourage like communication so i know it sounds kind of weird but i'd start with a simple question like hey i've been going through a breakup recently i really appreciate your support what's it like for you when i ask you know when we like talk about this instead of talking about league that's scary what's scary about it um it's trying to tread ground in a totally like the grass isn't cut it's all tall grass trying to figure out how to navigate a new avenue for the relationships uh in my life and so that's scary because i don't know how receptive they'll be to that maybe they'll just want to play league maybe they just you know they had a long day at work they talked about it with somebody else and so they just want to chill yeah but like yeah it it's unknown it's an unknown absolutely right and so you talked earlier about how maybe this is a dynamic with men and i think that generally like culturally like we're not my experience growing up as a man i can't really say if it's exclusively for men maybe women do this too maybe trans people do it who knows right we can't really comment on them but i know that generally speaking we just we just play games and we don't really talk about stuff much you know yeah yeah i've had to bring emotion wheels with my friends of like yeah they say i'm feeling bad and i say okay what do you mean pull up an emotion wheel please and we'll go through it and they'll they'll say oh i'm feeling guilty anxious yeah so i mean do you think you're helping them in that moment i hope so that was one time success rate so far okay for one so so that's also the kind of thing where i think you should ask for feedback in that situation be like hey was it kind of weird that i like brought up this emotion wheel or was it you know just like talk to them because i think the issue here is that you're not you're kind of operating alone and you're not getting any feedback and you've got to be careful because there's that reassurance resistance where even if they say oh no it's totally fine a boss it doesn't bother me at all like you've got to be a little bit careful about your reaction to when you ask a question you really have to listen and try to accept what they say whether it's good or bad and even if they say hey it's a pain in the ass i just want to play league how would that make you feel i get it right another time so that's like pretty cool because even if you're cutting the tall grass and there's a gigantic snake underneath now you know what their boundary is and you're not going to burden them anymore so like communication is really important the other thing that i'd recommend and this is also this is going to be even scarier is that you actually tell your friends like hey do you all have time for like a call to talk about stuff that isn't league i think that'd be cool it's a lot easier to do that in person because you know you wrap up youtube video or whatever and you just chill um but online like so so i mean if you've got a group chat or whatever like i would actually orchestrate that conversation and almost take something of a leadership role where i would share with your friend group hey here's what i've here's been my experience i went through a breakup recently i've leaned on you all for support one thing that i noticed is that it feels kind of one way to me because i don't know if it's just because you all haven't gone through a breakup or you know what's going on here but i i just wanted to let you know that i'm like i've really appreciated y'all being there for me and it means a lot to me and my door is always open if anyone needs support and also i'm kind of curious like how do y'all feel about talking like getting together and talking about stuff or like you know that isn't league and just communicate with your team you know you're not saying and this is what where people kind of screw up with communication is that oftentimes they think that like communication means telling your teammates what to do hey like we need to we need to go kill baron or the dragon or whatever right like we need to do this we need to do this we need to do this whereas like being an effective communicator especially in a moba i found it's way way better to ask questions instead of telling people what to do so like you can ask people like hey do you want me to ward on the top side of the map or the bottom side of the map like where do you want to play as a carry yeah and then like the neat thing the reason that you gain 500 mmr from that move is that if you ward somewhere and your carry is playing on the opposite side and they get killed instead of raging at them if you ask them ahead of time hey where do you want me to ward they like subconsciously they're going to go play around your vision oh yeah yeah cause you'll and then they won't feed it's like bizarre but if you tell him hey dumb ass go play around the vision you're on the wrong side of the map they're just gonna rage at you they're gonna in down mid you like you get like so like this is where i know it sounds kind of weird but maybe video games are a good analogy for real life and what i would really encourage is that you just have a conversation with your friends and be like hey i really appreciate what you all have done i'm kind of curious like if anyone is like have y'all gone through anything you know that i can help you with you can even like open the door in that session or just kind of talk to them about is this okay is this not okay and the one thing you've got to be kind of careful about is your reassurance resistance because this may be the kind of thing where if they say like oh no it's totally fine or maybe they'll say something wild which is no like i actually like it's so nice to hear that you appreciate it it makes me feel like i did something useful with my day instead of just playing league to be able to help a friend of mine now i don't know if they're going to be able to tap into that quite yet i i don't know about that one they're yeah we're all still in the man that's crazy face so yeah so so so i i mean i think the key thing though is that you know have a conversation with them like you can solicit feedback from both individuals and even get together as a group because like this is what needs to happen right someone needs to take the lead and change the dynamic of your communication and open the door for a conversation that is not just video games how does that sound to you uh it sounds like it's exactly what i'm looking for i'm now i now need to think and reflect on how to do that more pragmatically like once we get in the call i imagine scheduling will be fine once we get in the call how do we start talking about our day um i guess i just have to have questions lined up like how's work been the past month yeah so so i'm gonna give you some pragmatic tips this is great we're not gonna leave you hanging here a boss so i would schedule a call right and i would tell people like hey i wanted to if i were in your shoes you don't have to duplicate this precisely but i would say you know hey um i was just hoping to hop on a call with everybody for like maybe half an hour and i wanted to talk a little bit about communication a couple of things i noticed that most of the time when we talk we talk about games as you all know i've been going through a breakup recently and i found a lot of like really awesome support from you all so first of all i wanted to thank everyone the other question that i kind of had is that as you all have been supporting me i sort of feel like that's a little bit lopsided and that i want to just tell people that i'm here to support y'all and i was just curious about having a conversation about whether we want to like intentionally talk about things going on in our lives that are not gaming that's why i'd like to meet and to just basically see it figure out if people are on board for this kind of thing are you interested yeah and then you can go to like i wouldn't come in with like hey what's going on in your life like hey like are you dating and like you know don't come in with a set of questions because you got to get people on board they've got to like queue up first right you got to accept the party invite and then you have to sign up for the queue you don't want to just like queue up and then like they're in a game and they're like hey we didn't sign up for this does that make sense so i think frame setting here is very important yeah and i i liked how you framed it as thank you for the support because personally six months ago you know i would have said sorry i'm such a uh sorry i've been so down or sorry i've been relying so heavily on y'all so yeah yeah what's the difference there beautiful uh i got this from a day nine video where he he talked about showing flipping apologies for appreciation so instead of saying sorry i'm rambling thank you for listening uh sorry i've been so sad thanks for your patience type of thing yeah absolutely yeah so that's going to help with your guilt right because it's like there's a lot of good subtlety there one is the acknowledgement that it's okay to be struggling and that that's not something you need to apologize for and then you can express gratitude so i think you can give that a shot just be mentally prepared that this is often like sometimes it's a lot for people and they don't really know how to respond so if it doesn't work out you know come back to discord talk to us talk to the community about it and or maybe post on subreddit or whatever whether it goes well or doesn't go well like you know give us an update because we'd love to hear and for other people who are listening as well if you want to like deepen your relationship with your friends this is kind of exactly how you do it especially because there's a there's like a i don't know how to say this there's like a unwritten set of rules and no one knows how to like broach like no one knows how to like enter the unexplored territory of like talking about feelings we'll kind of get on you know help each other out with here and there and things like that but like this is like you just have a conversation about it and ask people if you're worried if you're feeling guilty don't sit with that guilt on your own ask people hey what's it like is it okay that i do this like i'd love to help you out you know i'm always available to talk um i kind of feel like i owe you you know and and you know people will say oh like if they say that like what what if you say that a boss what are your friends going to say uh i don't know i kind of just want to do this for me because like for me i love uh our my friends get together we play yu-gi-oh once a week i love that but honestly my favorite parts are the half hour as we're building up and we just catch up and we just talk like oh yeah i went to this food place i saw this move like that to me is my favorite part of the night when we just talk to each other um yeah and so i hope they're receptive to it and if they're not i don't know i there's like eight friends in the group so chances are at least some of them absolutely right about that yeah so and in terms of the guilt and the spirituality and stuff like that i think that's maybe a topic for a different day does that sound okay that's that's a different day for sure uh that's something i gotta talk with for my with my parents and you know figuring that out yeah awesome so um any kind of would you like to kind of summarize takeaways like what's the situation that you're in and what do you think you should do about it like what's it swallow so [Music] my current situation i guess as a recap would be i have a group of friends and we're long distance so we don't see each other in person very much when we talk online over discord it's usually about games and through games exclusively and i want to try to bridge the gap of having a more personal interpersonal relationship and so to do that some ways would be framing why i want to do it saying like i appreciate how you guys have been supporting me in tough times and i either open the door or uh my plan would be to schedule like hey saturday night can we hang out and just talk um and seeing how they respond to that and also at least for my personal situation if i feel guilt recognizing why and asking the person more directly and seeing how they how they feel about it maybe they don't see the same thing i do at all so um what else oh i think uh having face cams helps a lot it's a lot harder to keep track of conversations yeah absolutely so great tips so just to clarify a couple things so i think asking your individual friends how they receive and perceive you're leaning on them for support like whether it's okay or it's too much or too little signaling to them that your door is open if they ever need that right because sometimes it's like hard to because like i can imagine that they're in a situation where they're feeling guilty too i don't want to burden a boss with my problems but you're you're totally fine with it and so everyone's like i don't want to burden my friend with my problems i don't want to burn my friend with my problems so y'all are just sitting there in a single like you're in part eq but everyone's playing a single-player game yeah right and then you don't you know i'm not going to rotate to their lane they're not going to rotate to my lane and then y'all are just going to lose whereas like we just need rotations both ways and that's how you win a game right and so sort of signaling to people that you appreciate what they've done for you how is it for them and that you'd love to support them if they ever need it appreciate what they do see how it is for them and see what we can do to to build on that yeah 100 okay and then just watch out for your reassurance resistance i will work on that yeah another day just notice it notice like oh like this person is telling me something and i'm not able to take it in that's where you're going to start with that i that's definitely a problem reassurance resistance yeah keep these noted all right cool thank you very much thank you very much abbas take care you too you
