right and because gifted kids spend so much time trying to make other people happy they just have no cognitive energy left to actually perform you're trying to live up to your own expectations trying to live up to their expectations when all you need to be doing is like learning how a circuit Works welcome and today I think that the topic is what are you afraid of right or what scares you yes since it's Halloween we're going to be focusing on fear and what do you go by my friend Eleanor okay nice to meet you Eleanor so what are you what what scares you or what makes you most afraid generally called it in like two terms but it's failure and disapproval okay um uh it's it's more on it can come from others the the that feeling of failure and disapproval but sometimes it comes even for me and I guess along the way I've been I've been granulating the two together and it's so scary trying to monitor everything you say and do in fear of that okay can you tell me a little bit more about how the two have been combined recently um so uh uh to give a bit of context I think it started back in high school um how do I say this so in a simple term I've been called a gifted child so like it's it's something that stuck to me ever since childhood and until it went and I went to a specialized high school I guess wow and then that sort of thing yeah it's piled up and then along the way um I grew a bit arrogant if I can call it that I I started I began like comparing I think it's more of comparing my others first comparing myself to others to feel a sort of validation so like oh I you got over a hundred you got um this person got a 93 and I got a 95 and like in inside me I'm like oh I am higher so like I sort of felt validated for that and so it went on for like three months like I that comparison thing and then I didn't realize that others including the people that I've began comparing comparing myself into um began being so annoyed and irritated with it and they began talking behind my back that that yeah about that and wait so they were annoyed they were annoyed that you would make comparisons yes yeah it's so I think it's in a way they think it's sort of arrogant of me to compare myself to them and you would you would compare yourself vocally to them yes I used to do that in high school um yeah in high school okay and I think I was around how old was I I think I was 16. I I think I was 16 or about to turn 16. okay um and then that's and we had after a few months I think three or four months we had that intervention about that they like they call it an open Forum where everyone just goes up to a person and say whatever they want to say about that person like may it be complaints or anything related to that anything they want to say to that person they can say it So like um so I went up there like they asked me to go up there and they began vocalizing the things that um yeah the things that I've been doing for the past few months and I'm not gonna deny that I'm wrong like deep inside I know that there's a part there's I play the YouTube um that uh it was not good of me to vocalize what uh what uh what my scores are and all that sure and then yes it's paralleled into oh my God like in the like right now like what if I say something wrong and I do something wrong and it happened again since after that intervention I began watching what I say what I do like every miniscule detail I've been focusing on that so like I don't offend them and how many years ago was that wait um so it's 20 22 today um I think three years okay nearly four years yeah during four years since I'm in University right now um and after a few months of that um some of them came up to me during a forum again it was a notes thing like instead of speaking out loud we give the person notes where they where they write things that they want to say to you but can't vocalize it so like yeah they give me notes during that forum and it was a subject related thing like you have to do that you can't escape that it's something mandatory for a specific subject so like all so like all the things that I've seen from previous classmates during that moment they were like um um you've changed so much and I can barely uh recognize your compare you towards the person that you were before and I think that's a good thing and so um and some of them even say I hope it continues like this and I understand that coming from them it's it might be a good thing like they were definitely observing the differences of like how I acted but how I took uh what I took from it was like um so I have to keep on like watching what I say every every minute of the day like if I reply to them wrong well they like will be counted as disapproval well like yeah I started from that so it sounds tough because like okay so you had a problem quote unquote right and then you started acting very very carefully being very thoughtful about what you say almost like a little bit paranoid and and want to make sure that you are very careful with what you say and that everyone's like hey this is great you know yes I guess and and it sounds quite tiring to police yourself that way um is that how is it and is that what you feel like you have to do even a simple message from even my closest friends I would go I would just say a simple greeting of hi hello good morning and even that I would get so nervous like did I did I use the right emojis did I write or did I type the correct things even greetings I'm so scared of that okay and so where does the failure and disapproval come in um that's I think it's more of an internal when it comes to the academics um it's uh I've mentioned before that I like the comparison thing that I've used to do so instead of um I think since I've started University that's where it came from like comparing all uh I I I don't have any good study habits that's what I'm gonna start with I'm the type of person that I would study the same day and I would pass so that's how it started and it turned into like now I'm in college so and everyone's viewing me like um you can do this specific thing since you came from this specific School and and right now all I'm trying to do is not fail even though I failed two subjects already and that's like I'm just in my second year and yeah it sounds tough to try to not I mean so it sounds like you're not really focused on learning you're not really focused on succeeding or anything like that you're just trying not to fail yes uh I think that too since um I'm a scholar so I need to pass actually I can't afford to fail okay so snakes are high too so it's not just about ego or expectations sounds like there's a real Financial reason to to I mean because if it sounds like if your grades aren't good then you're not going to be able to go to school anymore yes yes um yeah I mean and when you say disapproval whose disapproval are you worried about um myself my parents and even I think it generally encompasses my family members and some of my um from my friends it's not really disapproval it's more like disappointment that since what what if they ask me for help and it's something I cannot help them with especially in subjects that um they've they or other people have heard that I'm good at I see so so it sounds like there's this okay so let me understand this see if I get this Eleanor so what I'm getting is that there's like there are two eleanors out there one is this image that other people have of gifted child went to a fancy school things are easy for her since she's accomplished so much and went to the school like she should be able to handle this and friends should like oh like Eleanor's good at math or good at whatever so like if you're good at math or science or or chemistry or whatever then if people come to you for help you should be able to help them yes basically that's it and then there's this other Eleanor who's struggling that hasn't developed good study habits um is kind of like struggling not to fail but heading towards failure and those seem like two very different people foreign which one's the real you generally can't answer that but I think it's leaning more on the latter actually the failure is the real you right yes and that sounds really scary like you've already failed two classes you don't know how to study and if you lose your scholarship like then who will you be I don't know well who I will be after that right you certainly won't be that first person anymore yeah so Eleanor I think it's how this sounds very scary because what I'm what I'm getting as I listen to you it almost feels like I I mean maybe I'm coming on too strong here but it feels a little bit inevitable to me that I'm not saying this is true but what it feels like is I hear your story is like almost like despair like I've already failed two classes and I don't know if I can turn this boat around and save myself before it's too late um I uh it's for a bit of context I'm actually in an engineering program and I'm shifting to another engineering program that I actually like the two subjects that I failed were in my previous one and I'm hoping that I'm hoping that maybe it will change once I actually started doing what I like okay I think that's a good step in the right direction so Eleanor I I don't know if this kind of makes sense are you familiar with the term ego or ahamgar um I think I have heard the word ego from previous classes in high school what's your understanding of what the ego is um I'm so sorry I can't remember it oh that's all I can remember is that it has something to do with oneself yeah that so so the ego is kind of our opinion of ourselves and so I don't know if this kind of makes sense but I think the problem is that neither of the two eleanors are actually real they're both constructions of the Mind what do you think about that um trying to think of it and yeah and it was okay so help me understand what in what way does it feel right to you [Music] um it's so uh you've mentioned that it's not the two sides are not really me did I understand it right yeah um so it's like uh I'm not the other person because the the one that's like good grades um the one they asked for help since uh since I think that's more of a mask more than anything and it's built on expectations others have for me and the latter one that's like the one that's failing is oh it's not really me but more in a way that but more in a way that I'm trying my best to prevent that from happening so I'm somewhere in the middle but not really yeah so so let me put it to you this way do you think the Eleanor who is a failure could exist if you did not have these expectations from the outside um without this expectations I don't think I would have a concrete definition of what the failure would be exactly right so so this is what I'm saying is that both sides of those are actually like they're based off of expectations so it sounds like you had expectations of who you are or you other people placed expectations on you and then almost as a response to that like it's kind of like here's the real you and people expected this but out of any positive charge like we have to create like a negative charge does that make sense so this is why like gifted kids struggle so much like gifted kids feel like failures all the time the gifted kids who are actually successful don't even view themselves as gifted kids does that make sense yes so once you become because yeah um because um uh most gifted most gifted kids that people would call gifted are actually very hard-working individuals is how I view them that's how you view them because yeah because they're different from you right those are the successful ones they're the hard-working ones and what are you if they're hard working what does that make you I would always call myself the lazy one absolutely right so that's actually false too so that is a comparison that your mind is making do you see that in the same way that you used to compare oh I'm smarter because I got a hundred and this person got a 93. now you're looking at other people you're making a comparison this person is is hard working they're a real gifted kid but I have a lazy gifted kid do you see how your mind is making that comparison yes so this is kind of weird but the ego makes comparisons so if we if I have an identity of myself if I say Eleanor I am smarter than you or stupider than you both of those are a comparison it's a sense of identity that is not established by me it's established by a comparison does that make sense yes yes so even if you look at people who are arrogant or egotistical they can't be arrogant or egotistical without making a comparison to someone else does that make sense yes yes I'm envisioning it right right now actually right and so this is the key thing so feeling like you're arrogant or feeling like you're a failure or both determined by your relationship with the outside world yes yes does that make sense what are you on affected yeah it's affected by external factors absolutely now let me ask you something when you decided to switch engineering majors was the was the desire to switch coming from some kind of expectation from the outside or some kind of like desire from the inside um I can say it's a mix of both but desire is the thing that comes out of comes out of on top of those okay very good right so there's certainly an element to it that comes from the outside and and that the other interesting thing is like so for example let's just look at that so what what part of your desire to switch comes from the outside why did you like if that kind of makes sense if that question makes sense um it's if family think they they want me to take an engineering major but but I did not get into that University with that specific major so I have to pick something that relates to engineering that they might approve of and I did not like that so a few after a year I realized that I can't do this so I'm gonna do what I like even though I've heard that it's so difficult even it's as difficult as the one that I'm taking so I went and go I I went ahead and planned everything since at least if I'm suffering I'm suffering in something that I like if that makes sense oh so so hold on let me understand this so you're picking a harder major it's what they categorize it as hard every day yes but but hold on a second Eleanor aren't you like so here you are a lazy gifted kid who's already failed two clashes you're on a scholarship and you're picking a harder major like oh my God that doesn't sound like a good idea when you think about it it does not so what are you doing there oh one thing that I actually noticed was since I started studying for the subjects of this major I'm searching at I actually like studying studying these subjects compared to my previous ones in my previous ones I would just go do I have to do this again like I have to study this again so so yeah keep going so oh wait I'll reveal my previous is it already we reveal my uh my the sub the major that I'm taking right now if you watch it okay I was I I mean I currently I'm taking an electrical engineer in major subjects and I'm switching to a chemical engineering a major so like when I whenever I see circuits I will just go is this what I'm gonna do for the rest of my life I would I would go stare at circuits like I would connect wires compute voltages currents and all that and it does not make me feel like it does not make me feel like I want to graduate okay it makes me feel like if like it doesn't even it if if I'm sorry I'm I'm stuttering as I think about it I see no future where okay with that major so let's just pause for a second okay I understand you've got more to say but I don't want to miss a couple of these statements so here's here's an idea maybe if you're in a major where you it makes you feel like you don't want to graduate and yes if you are in a major that you see no future in maybe that has something to do with why you're failing right and I I know you recognize that so I think the rest of it like whatever else you've got to say is actually sort of like you've already said the most important things so my point is like let's just think through this for a second okay so here you are afraid of disapproval afraid of failing and there's kind of this Eleanor who's like this gifted kid and now you're not sure if you can kind of live up to those expectations all of those expectations come from the outside they don't actually come from in here and so you're afraid yes that you're not going to be able to live up to them and your families like go be an electrical engineer because they make good money and they have good jobs and things like that right they're like that's what they said yeah like you you touch all the topics and you're gifted right Eleanor you're not like like if you were stupid then you couldn't learn electrical engineering but since you're gifted you know like you're smart enough to be a brilliant electrical engineer you can invent a computer chip you can make so much money you can do Quantum Computing there's all these kinds of things and so even the part of you that's afraid of disappointing people that the part of you that's kind of like afraid of being a failure but that's like disappointing other people and then being sort of being a failure yourself but that's the the even the failure yourself is you don't want to disappoint people right so it's their disappointment and then your disappointment with yourself for disappointing them does that make sense yeah yeah it's actually has nothing to do with you even your disappointment is like in disappointing other people you with me yes so all that is not you and here's what here's why I think it's it's good hopeful I'm hopeful that you'll switch to your your chemical engineering because as long as you're living your life for other people like you know disappointing people hurts but it doesn't hurt as much as calculating voltages and looking at circuits right actually that's what I've said I I just went like after doing I after doing a subject I just after doing exams for that specific subject I just went on I can't do this I cannot do this so after I saw my parents I just went Mom I'm switching to chemical engineering I cannot do this anymore yeah so Eleanor let me explain something to you I've seen this a ton of times so some gifted kids live a life to avoid disappointing other people and if you're living a life to avoid disappointing other people you're living a life to avoid pain you with me yes and if you live a life to avoid pain what you end up signing up for is almost certainly more painful than the disappointment so it's like you have a choice between studying electrical engineering hating looking at circuits for like 30 hours a week and then you go get a job as an electrical engineer and then you hate your job for 50 hours a week for 40 years that amount of pain is so great that you will never succeed in that field because your whole strategy is to avoid pain that's why you're majoring in electrical engineering in the first place to avoid the pain of disappointing other people right yes and so like you can't live a life where your strategy is to avoid pain like it's not going to work you're never going to become successful or live up to your potential using that strategy you're trying to pick the least bad scenario and that's like you're not going to become your best self that way does that make sense yes yes I understand it so I think all of that crap about discipline like there's two eleanors that's actually the same Eleanor and neither one is you what you really are is like if you like chemical engineering then do chemical engineering and like I don't know how to say this but the way to make people proud is actually by like living your best life right because you're gonna do you can do electrical engineering and you may have the IQ to do it but you're not going to make your parents Proud by doing something that is painful day in and day out for like 40 years of your life you're probably going to make your parents Proud by doing something that you like giving it a hundred percent and then excelling in that field the last thing that I'm going to share with you is that I do think you have some growing to do especially when it comes to study habits right so I'm glad that you recognize I don't think you're lazy I think you just never needed to learn how to study and that can be and it's good that you picked a field that is very like enjoyable to you because that helps some but chances are if you really want to excel like you're going to have to learn how to study what do you think about that yes in a way that I just look at them and feel overwhelmed so I never start anything I'm at that pace okay okay so that's that so like when you say handle your time management well how so uh I've started uh like right now during the semester I've started like making tables so for this specific day I'm going oh I still do online classes by the way I don't have any like in campus classes so um for this specific day I'm gonna finish this topic this lecture and in a few days I will take the quiz but like on this day I have to finish it and then understand so for the next day I'm gonna do this subject and I think it's working pretty well it's not all I don't always follow it but I mostly follow it okay and when you say it's working pretty well what does that mean um well ever since I started doing that I don't feel as overwhelmed as I was before okay so let's let's do a little bit of quick teaching okay that's fantastic I'm really happy to hear that so you're doing great Eleanor because you figured out a couple of things that will help you break away from The Curse Of Being A Gifted kid so we're going to talk about the curse of being a gifted kid so the curse of being a gifted kid is knowing what you need to do and always in your mind thinking about the what I need to be just more disciplined I need to wake up on time I need to get better at time management it's always about what you need to do goals goals goals goals goals but what you're actually what the gifted kids miss is the how they don't they never think about the how they don't think about scheduling and breaking things up and like to-do lists and like they don't focus on the how they always look at the goal of what they need to accomplish does that make sense so you're already doing great there yes yes the second thing is that gifted kids get really easily overwhelmed because they are used to being able to fit everything in their head so like when you're growing well when you're like 15 and you've got five subjects or seven subjects to study you actually don't need to schedule anything because in your mind you can hold all the things that you have to do does that kind of make sense like you can handle it when you're 15. but as you get older you can't hold there's too much stuff to hold in your head and you try to hold it in your head and then you end up getting overwhelmed because it's too much to hold right so there's like yes there are kids that are average IQ that have too much to carry so they go and they get a backpack and they learn how to use a backpack when they're like 13. but what some of us do when we're gifted kids is we can hold a lot of stuff we've got really huge hands so we never need a backpack and then we're like holding more and more and more stuff and then we start to feel overwhelmed and our brain can't break apart or manage the tasks anymore so I think it's really great that you're doing scheduling and that it's working for you there's one last thing that I want to share with you which is some interesting research so a group of researchers tried to figure out what kinds of thoughts so if they if you take kids who are have good grades kids who have medium grades and kids who have bad grades and they tried to figure out what kind of thoughts are in this person's head so the first thing that they looked at is they they saw a bunch of kids who had this this kind of thought I want to get an A and that did not correlate very strongly with getting an a so if a kid is thinking all the time I want to get an A I want to get an A I want to get an A they don't actually study very much and they don't get very good grades you with me so far then they looked at another group of kids who I need to get an A it was very important for them it's not something that they want it's not a desire it's a need I need to get an A because I need to bring my GPA up so I don't lose my scholarship does that make sense like do you understand that kind of thinking and how it's different from the first one yes yes it's a need not to want yeah and do you think that leads to higher grades the same grades or lower grades higher yeah that's what one would think but actually leads to the same grades is not any better okay absolutely the same so then they look to the third group of kids they asked the kids okay for the kids who actually get A's what's in your head and it's really interesting they the kids who get A's in their head they don't think about what they want they don't want an a they don't need an a what they think about is I'm gonna go to the library Wednesday at 3 P.M and study for an hour they actually don't care about the goal they focus on the how oh so there's there's like data on this that you can look at kids who get good grades and they don't think about what they want or what they need they just not just but the strongest variable that correlates with good grades is actually like being very specific with scheduling I'm going to go to the library Wednesday at 3 pm and I'm going to study chemistry Thursday at 4 pm it's going to be physics Friday morning at 10 A.M is going to be review for my chemistry test on Friday afternoon okay yep I understand so so this is what's so tricky is once we get once we're like a gifted kid we develop this like ego or this idea right like oh I gotta be this I have to live up to expectations and then we're so to think about this your mind is so busy like every time you sit down to study you can't even think about the studying all you're thinking about is I hate this all you're thinking about is if I hate this how am I going to get an A if all you're thinking about is if I hate this and I can't get an A what am I going to tell my parents I'm gonna lose my scholarship and then you sit down you have a textbook in front of you and for one hour you're not actually doing any studying you're not lazy how do you feel at the end of that hour you feel exhausted you're just spending a bunch of energy doing stuff that isn't studying and then people think I'm lazy um it definitely do that yep and and so the reason you're failing is not because you're stupid not because you're lazy it's because your mind is doing a lot of work that isn't schoolwork and it's you know like it's that simple and so I think the more you can let go of what other people want like they can be disappointed in you if they want right because something else hopefully you'll learn at some point in your life is you can't make someone else happy right it's kind of weird simple to say it hard to really realize and the more that you kind of listen to what you want and what I love about this more than anything the reason I'm actually pretty hopeful for you is like because you're actually you're scheduling this stuff out and the more that you schedule like the better year that you just show up you do your work for the day and is it are you going to get an A a b or a c who the hell knows but the kids who get A's are the ones who show up and do the work and that's what we call disciplined right those are the hard-working people yes and here you are scheduling tasks and actually doing them maybe you're more hard-working than you realize any last thoughts or questions before we wrap up um I have no questions I'm actually trying to digest everything [Music] kids I'm sorry yeah I'm sorry no go ahead Chris if the gifted kids is really something yeah it's really interesting what it does to people's mind right and because gifted kids spend so much time trying to make other people happy they just have no cognitive energy left to actually perform you're trying to live up to your own expectations trying to live up to their expectations when all you need to be doing is like learning how a circuit works right but you're doing so much other stuff so good luck
