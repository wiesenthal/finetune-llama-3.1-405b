so this is where like you know this is what technology kind of does is that the sensory overload kind of like short-circuits us and so we're sort of there's like all these kind of um technology like conflictingly does things to our brain so it stimulates some parts of our brain it exhausts other parts of our brain i'm just going to check tic-toc for five minutes before bed right i am just going to check tick-tock for five minutes before going to bed and the irony here is that this is a tick tock about checking tick tocks for five minutes about that i am just going to check tick-tock let's keep going what you know about rolling down in the deep end i have i have depression but you yeah right so it's kind of wild because like i know it sounds sort of weird but we've got a phone here that's designed to help you limit your phone usage and we've got tick tocks on tick tock with you know a ton of likes that are designed to raise awareness about how you can get sucked into tick tock and i know it's kind of weird because like it's almost like you know the the internet is becoming self-aware in terms of these things like we're starting to recognize that we can actually use the platforms for good instead of evil that phones can actually be designed to help you limit your technology usage that tick-tock can be a platform that can actually be used to raise awareness about how addictive addictive tick-tock can be and so i know it's kind of bizarre right even like when we talk about what we do here it's like we can use a twitch stream to help people who are depressed because they watch way too much twitch right we can make a youtube video about spending less of your time watching youtube videos about motivation and actually doing stuff so i know it sounds kind of weird but it's my firm belief that if we're going to tackle these problems we actually need to use these tools at our disposal that to a certain degree you have to fight fire with fire that abstinence only is not really going to be an effective strategy when it comes to technology because you can't not have a phone right you can't stay off the internet i mean maybe you can i don't know maybe you can pull it off but for me it's hard anyway and i think for most people it's hard so what we're gonna have to do as individuals is we're gonna have to figure out okay how are we gonna like actually do this right how can we develop limits around the technology that we use how can we use technology how can we use some of these things to raise awareness about the problems that they themselves are creating and because that's the only way that it's going to work right and i think generally speaking if you look at historical like wars and stuff like that if there's a if there's a there's a tech imbalance you're probably going to lose and what you really need to do is use that tech for your favor got to fight fire with fire um so i thought that those were kind of interesting because it's sort of like self-referential and aware feels kind of mc-usher-ish to me anyway let's take a look at some more so this one i think is really cool so i think this is from a psychologist so we'll watch that one more time so this is actually really important to understand part of the reason that it's hard to get off of these content platforms is actually because there isn't a consistency of what you get right so like every time so you know my poison of choice is reddit and every time i click on a reddit post i don't really know what i'm going to get right is this going to be a reddit post that i'm glad i clicked on or is it going to be a reddit post that's a little bit of a waste of time and so this is a psychologist that's talking about partial reinforcement or random reinforcement which is also a big part of why gambling happens so there are lots of studies that basically show that if you can predict a reward and there's a consistency that gets you to a particular word you're less likely to engage in the behavior so for example like if i'm playing an mmo and i am looking for a piece of loot if there's an rng component it's more i'm more likely to engage in the behavior and this is the big thing with loot boxes so if you like look at what companies do right so they'll institute loot boxes instead of just letting you pay for like a cosmetic item so instead of just paying 50 bucks for a particular cosmetic what i have to do with what they sort of discovered is that if i spend 50 on average and i'll get the cosmetic they can actually engage my behavior more if it's on average and some people get the cosmetic at 20 bucks and some people get the cosmetic at 70 bucks so most people get it around 50 and what they sort of figured out is that if we make it a random reinforcement schedule it's more likely to engage in the behavior and we've seen this with rats as well so a lot of studies on rats that basically like every four presses of a lever you get like a little hit of cocaine so they'll actually use cocaine when they do rat studies but if there's a 25 chance of success you're more likely to press the lever if you're a rat because what happens is sometimes you hit you hit the lever and you get you get the cocaine you hit it again you get the cocaine you hit it again you get a cocaine it's like 100 success rate three times in a row and that experience lodges in your brain and reinforces the behavior so this is also something that i think we're sort of seeing in content alg aggregation platforms is that interestingly enough you're not guaranteed to enjoy what you watch and it's that kind of lack of guarantee which sometimes makes it really really really positive and that you really love and sometimes it makes it really really negative so you're you're you're you know trying seven times eight times nine times no reward and you get frustrated to the point that you may think about stopping but if the reward schedule is too low then you will stop but this is just a dry spell if you keep going you're gonna you're gonna get get what you're looking for so it's really interesting how this works there's one other thing that i want to bring up with y'all which is that we also see this actually as a reason why abusive relationships persist so a lot of times people are super confused about i don't understand like why this person doesn't leave an abusive relationship right because like this person mistreats you like i don't understand why you're in that relationship and if you talk to the abused partner in a relationship what do they say oh but you don't know the real person they're just like that sometimes sometimes they can be so sweet they don't really mean to right so people don't usually stay in abusive relationships that are consistently abusive what they stay in are in relationships with dr jekyll and mr hyde where depending on the day you can get the person who you fell in love with or someone who's incredibly toxic so we can even see this partial reinforcement and if you yourself have been stuck in an abusive relationship or if you stayed in an abusive relationship for a long time ask yourself why did you stay it's probably because the person that you were with wasn't like that all the time right sometimes they were sweet sometimes they were caring sometimes they were compassionate and supportive and so what you're doing is you're hoping that over time they'll grow more into that person right you're hoping that like they'll be less toxic over time and like more awesome over time whereas the truth is that unfortunately in abusive relationships what we tend to see is the opposite that as people recognize that i'm not going to be punished for my mad bad behavior the bad behavior comes out more and more and more because early on and this is sort of from the perspective and abu of an abuser which may be in our audience as well you may have noticed this even if you don't think of yourself as an abuser that as you sort of let your temper out as you kind of like let go a little bit and become a little bit toxic if your partner doesn't set limits on that what you may find yourself doing is giving into that more right you give into it more you give into it more and then you find yourself turning into a person that you don't even want to be so it's interesting because this random reinforcement schedule is something that's like a fundamental part of how our brain reinforces behavior so it's the kind of thing where like you know it's just the way we're wired so we'll see things like gambling explicitly take advantage of this i think these content aggregation platforms or social media things like that i don't know that they're quite as predatory as gambling is but it definitely sort of is a factor there we even see it in video games so there's an interesting study that was done many many years ago which sort of discovered that the reason that video games are addictive is not because of the reward it's because of the denial of the reward so why are from software games so damn satisfying to play because they're so freaking hard so when you finally beat melania blade of mikala why does it feel so good it's because it was so hard and if you think about it fighting against that boss is a random reinforcement schedule because you know sometimes you do pretty well sometimes waterfall waterfowl dance doesn't come out very often or sometimes because of the rng you manage to like you know roll out of the way and you kind of like handle it okay and you're kind of fishing for that rng that confluence of events where they don't use the moves that you don't really know how to dodge and as long as you can get them to use the moves that you do know how to dodge eventually you'll win so we see it in relationships we see it in abusive relationships we see it in video games we see it on social media so be aware of this principle be aware that it's part of the way that your brain works and the more awareness you have over it the better control you'll have of it and for those of you who haven't played elden ring apologies for the the deep deep reference someone saying so dark souls fans are abuse victims sort of but i think it's interesting because i think even i remember um seeing something about miyazaki's design philosophy and a part of i think how they make the game is they actually were he was talking about like he has to channel his hatred or something like that i i'm misquoting this but he channels like a dislike for the end user he tries to punish you but i think what makes it so cool like that's what makes it so triumphant right is that like at the end of the day like the game is designed to be hard and like punishingly hard and at the same time the game has a lot of like it's such a beautiful game design because you can play it whatever way you want to you can run around naked with a short sword and you can still beat the game so he it's beautiful because he equips you with so many things to overcome the sadistic stuff that he like asks you to beat does that make sense right because i i don't think like it gives you so many tools like mimik tier right so if he really wanted to you know be abusive they just wouldn't have put mimic here into the game but they did and that's great okay let's keep going [Music] so there's a lot about this that i think is like really significant one is i like this tick tock because of the discrepancy between the facial expression and the lighting oh whoops sorry so this is where like you know this is what technology kind of does is that the sensory overload kind of like short-circuits us and so we're sort of there's like all these kind of um technology like conflictingly does things to our brain so it stimulates some parts of our brain it exhausts other parts of our brain and i i saw a really interesting post recently where people were asking why is exercise healthier than like stimulating the heart through caffeine right because like when you exercise your heart rate increases and that kind of heart rate is healthy for you and when you drink caffeine your heart rate increases as well but why do we think about heart rate increasing from caffeine as being different or not as healthy as heart rate through exercise and the reason for that is because our body is like a whole organism right there's a whole concert of different things and exercise does a lot more than just stimulate your heart it also increases your respiratory rate it alters your co2 levels it alters your o2 levels it it does all kinds of other things it affects blood pressure you see muscular contraction and the cool thing about muscular contraction is that the veins in your legs move that blood back to your heart through the movement of your muscles so this is why walking is really healthy for you because if you kind of think about it how do we get how do we transport the blood from our calves back to our heart we have to push it against gravity and the more that we move our legs the more that we contract our calf muscles the more we push that blood back so you sort of get like a bunch of stuff when you exercise happening all over your body which all is very healthy because that's the way the body was designed enter caffeine and it's sort of this isolated effect doesn't do anything to your respiratory rate doesn't do anything to your muscular contraction in your calves doesn't do anything to your venous return doesn't do any of that stuff it just targets one part of the heart and what we're seeing with technology is sort of the same thing where if we look at being stimulated in sort of a healthy way let's say we go to a party even right when we go to a party and there's music there and we're having a good time we get all kinds of influences on our brain we get social exposure right there's the empathic nature of even when we were talking to charlie earlier today if i change my facial expression versus if i do this right facial expressions will create like notice what you're doing right now chances are you're smiling like when i started smiling like you started smiling and so when we go to a place like a party there's all kinds of stuff that's going on for our brain we're engaging with people we're talking to people we're like having good conversations we're maybe feeling a little bit anxious we're overcoming that anxiety and falling into a conversation right so there's all kinds of different stuff that happens in a natural setting when we use something like tick-tock especially depending on what kind of you know tic tocs you look at we're going to get more of like a caffeine-like effect we're going to get sort of this isolated effect which is not nearly as healthy so you'll get bombarded with all this like high stimulus like you know sound and light and like all these different songs and entertainment and all that kind of stuff but what it's going to kind of do is like veg you out it's going to fatigue your mind it's going to fatigue your eyes you'll get sort of some amount of emotional suppression so we sort of know this as well that like different kinds of social media and video games and technology are going to have sort of paradoxical effects on your brain so on the one hand they kind of numb out negative emotions and over time it appears that prolonged use even though in the short term if i watch a funny tick tock it's going to numb out my negative emotion but when i spend hours and hours and hours on some kind of content platform even though each individual video seems to be numbing me out a little bit over time my mental health will globally kind of get worse so we kind of see is it's almost like overwhelming and stimulating kind of at the same time and paradoxically so be super careful about that um so i see that someone's legume bra is asking so would reading be similar to the use of watching something or playing it uh so i think reading is a good example of something that's a little bit more globally effective it's like globally harmonious in the way that it kind of calms you down you can still read an exciting book that's going to keep your attention but the way that the book affects you physiologically is going to be like somewhat different so your eye strain is going to be different even the amount of kind of like uv the wavelength of uv light that a book is going to be giving you is going to be different from a screen so there are all kinds of other things that that are involved with books as opposed to screens that are going to sort of affect your brain in different ways yeah books are op so twitch too right so this is where like it's it's not i mean hopefully this isn't turning into bashing tick tock which once again remember that all this stuff is coming from tiktok so that's like pretty cool right so twitch is something like each of these content platforms is going to have their own balance of pluses and minuses so what i love about twitch as a platform is that it allows you to form connections with other human beings it is a platform that involves engagement right we are not responding to the people who are making tick tocks what i'm doing is i'm talking to chat which is fantastic that's why personally i love twitch as a platform because i like to engage with people so one thing that i really hated about the pandemic is all of my teaching became virtual i love teaching a group of like actual people like it's so much fun and so what's awesome about twitch is that we can like develop some amount of relationships it turns out that the poison is actually the same thing the downside of twitch is that we can develop relationships right because sometimes those relationships get out of control these parasocial relationships become kind of bizarre we start to really like connect with this person on the internet and that relationship will never be reciprocal it's not capable of being reciprocal it's not how the platform is designed so we feel close to people we feel connected to people we can genuinely be inspired by people which is all fantastic and at the same same time there's like there's a there's a lack of reciprocity which is sort of how we just can't fix that problem right it's just the way that twitch is built and i don't think that it was built that in a way to um try to create that in a malicious way it's just you know someone came along and realized like how awesome would the internet be if content creators could directly interact with people with their audience and the truth is it's awesome like i love it like even this question that i'm answering this twitch allows for this kind of connection it allows for this kind of interaction and if we're not careful that parasocial relationship can actually impact your real-life relationships you can start to feel more connected to streamers on the internet you can start to like you know neglect your real-life relationships because you're spending time too much time watching streams right that it's kind of bizarre but i think that like what the internet is and what all these content platforms are is their fire and fire can be used in all kinds of amazing ways and it's incredibly dangerous so we need to just be super careful about all of these different different influences on our mind questions isn't that the same with a live audience sort of so here's the big difference so when you're with a live audience you can interact with them right there's some amount of connection there's definitely interaction but here's the difference when you are when you're part of a large audience okay great fantastic question when you're part of a large audience what is the duration of your relationship what is the duration of your relationship with someone on twitch right think about that how are those things different so i gave a talk yesterday really loved the talk it's one of the best experiences for me is someone who who goes and gives talks i really loved who i loved the questions i loved interacting with people all that kind of stuff i also personally liked getting in and receiving hugs i mean giving and receiving hugs so that was nice to be able to do but the challenge with in-person live audience interactions is that they tend the duration is short like it's limited right you don't i mean maybe you'll have something like a professor who you can build a relationship with over the course of several lectures but if you go and like give a talk like let's say you go to a you know a university because there's a there's a talk being given by someone there's like 300 people there and so you can do some back and forth but then it ends what's different what's both good and bad this is why we're playing with fire here on twitch is that you can always come back and the streamer's always going to be there right not always but they're going to stream every day three days we stream three days a week a lot of people stream five days a week people stream for a long time so the time span that you have to develop that parasocial relationship is way longer and then it can start to feel more connected right and and so it's different it's different and then what we sort of see is that when you have a quote-unquote live audience that's persistent over time that's when you form real relationships so you may have gotten you know there may have been a professor you really enjoyed one class you went took a second class you got to know them somewhat they start to become a mentor of yours you all form some kind of like lasting relationship that's healthy and wonderful and all that good stuff hopefully no abuses of the power dynamic there but that's the big difference is that the twitch relationship is a lot easier to maintain we didn't evolve an intrinsic understanding of the bizarre disconnect between real life and internet life says flatbug completely agree so here's it goes even one step further we didn't evolve to understand the distinction it goes one step further than that the internet has evolved to take advantage of and activate the circuitries that are active in real life right like that's actually how it evolves so this is something i want all y'all to understand the internet is undergoing a rapid rate of evolution and we're not evolving to it it is evolving to us so if you want to understand this all you need to do is look at content platforms and look at the evolution of social media we used to have myspace and then facebook came along and facebook allowed for more connection more interaction more of a network right because that's what people wanted like facebook was more connected than my myspace is more connected and then social media evolve evolved even further so text messages turned into snapchat right and then like we sort of developed whatsapp groups because the internet sort of figured out is people made a thousand different applications in a thousand different startups the ones that were the most aligned with our current neuro circuitry in psychology were the ones that blew up we also see this in terms of content so there used to be blogs right there are still blogs people would like sit down and they'd like write stuff out right and it would be like well thought out and then you'd publish a blog post and over time what does that become people sort of realized oh it's more emotionally engaging if i make a vlog instead of a blog because there's facial expression there's color there's light there's sound there's so many things that are much more engaging than reading stuff so along came the video content and even the written content so what we realize is oh written content is boring it doesn't hold the attention as well so what happened to the written content on the internet what is the most popular readable app or internet service right it's twitter i think and what's different about twitter twitter blew up because it was restricted and how short it can be and so what twitter sort of figured out is that the way to get people to engage consistently the best engagement with written content is going to be if we keep it short reddit i think is another good example right and so are we seeing that similar thing happen with video content so people used to make vlogs and video essays and they still do but what are the most popular channels on youtube right and what tick tock figured out is oh it seems like the most popular channels on youtube tend to be shorter in nature and people really like short content so let's make a platform that's all about socially engaging short segmented emotionally engaging content and thus tick tock was born and that's what all the kids are using nowadays so i don't think things are going to get much shorter than that by the way because i think we're sort of discovering where the sweet spot is and that's what's sort of happening so technology is evolving to adapt to our brain and people are making all kinds of different stuff and you even see this in terms of video game development right oh yeah someone was mentioning vines right so vines is a good example of that people started making vines and then it became tick-tock so even if we were talking about from software and and miyazaki and and stuff right so what's cool is like why is alden ring so much more noob friendly it's because there are all these built-in difficulty modifications that aren't done in settings like if i'm losing against a boss i can just go explore another place upgrade my weapon two more times and go back and fight the boss and suddenly i've modulated the difficulty i can choose to use summons or not use summons so what we sort of discovered is that like the more that we adapt to what people want these are the these are the technologies that are successful and i think so far um you know i think this has been done honestly in a pretty unsophisticated way so we know that for example game developers will employ things like behavioral economists well to a certain degree employ psychologists but i think that like you know i think that there's a lot that they haven't even touched and so crypto is actually a good example of this where like you know i've i've sort of looked at crypto for a while and like analyzed the psychology of it and there there are uh 12 or 13 discrete like psychological principles that are at play in crypto we made a video about a couple of those but there's like a lot more there and i'm sure that what's going to happen over time is like people will make cryptocurrencies that um activate these different things or sort of take advantage of them and then like those cryptocurrencies will be more successful and so we're just getting started so be careful and also you can sort of see like the evolution so it's not that we didn't evolve to tell the difference it's that the technology that's being developed is being developed to shrink that difference right those are the things that are the most successful why is twitch so successful as a platform it because it's because it adds the element of interaction to the internet why is discord so successful because it allows for interaction it allows for community building it allows for all this kind of stuff great question yeah healthy coin i mean this is going to be an exaggeration but like once a week we someone reaches out to us asking us about hey do you want to start healthy gamer coin or nfts or something like that it's not literally once a week but it happens a lot um uh okay should we keep going um anyone else gets so overwhelmed by something that they go on for a break but then non-stop scrolling just makes them even more overstimulated 100 right and this is this is the challenge is that like so let's understand the neuroscience of this for a second why do we take a break on some of these platforms when we feel exhausted and how do we feel more tired afterward it's interesting right so this kind of comes back to what i was saying earlier about understanding the amygdala and the hippocampus oh sorry a limbic system so the limbic system and the amygdala are emotional circuits of the brain especially the amygdala's responsible for fear and anxiety and our survival emotions and so what happens is we've discovered how to self-soothe so human beings are really good at sort of figuring out what calms down their emotions so this is where sometimes if we sort of discover i don't know if you all have like a friend who every time they're stressed out they give you a call and they like talk to you and you're like you're like the good you're like the therapist friend so you kind of like talk them down a little bit and they calm down and they feel better afterward and then what happens the next time they're upset they call you and then over time you fall into the role of the therapist friend and so they start to use you as a way of emotional decompression maybe you're guilty of this and you use other people for emotional decompression and so when that happens like human beings will figure out what works for them and so this is also what happens with substances right so if you're like 13 and you're you know struggling because you like someone at school and you tried asking them out and they laughed in your face and everyone else around you laughed because you had the audacity to ask them out was really they just you made them come uncomfortable and they didn't know what else to do but laugh i don't know that they're actually that malicious but it hurts a lot and then you're hanging out with your older sibling who's getting high with his friends and then you get high too and what happens all that crap goes away you feel so much better and so what happens the next time you feel upset you've got a solution that's going to take it away so that's what happens right so we've sort of discovered that if i laugh at memes for a little while then i'll feel emotionally better now the challenge that we run into is that even if i laugh at memes for a while there's another long-term more global effect on our brain that these different kinds of applications are causing stimulation riling us up right because what gets propagated it's the emotionally activating content so you may see stuff you may see some like you know parents like crying about losing their children and stuff like that you're going to see like other kinds of new stuff about the the russia ukraine war you're going to see stop stuff about you know this cat that lost a leg that is now able to walk on one foot or you can see all kinds of like random like emotionally charged content and it's going to be all over the place too so on the one hand you're kind of numbing yourself up and on the other hand you're kind of like activating yourself and like emotionally engaging yourself and so what you're left with is kind of this like a very unnatural emotional activation and an unnatural emotional suppression so it's sort of like doing uppers and downers at the same time right so there's there's something that back when i was doing a lot more addiction psychiatry sometimes people would use something called a speed ball which is they'd inject heroin and cocaine at the same time do not do that do not use drugs kids seriously and so that's what we're doing technology has now become somewhat of a speed ball so like when i sit down and i play a video game that both calms me down and pisses me off do you all get that like think about it like i'm gonna play a game to have fun and relax and after three hours it's gonna be like uh i don't understand i'm gonna i don't understand why i play this game right it's kind of it's kind of weird but that's what it does that's literally what does because it activates some circuits of our brain doesn't it suppresses other circuits of our brain and almost and why isn't that healthy like so all those circuits getting activated is actually healthy like but you have to activate them in a natural way because then they all get activated together and that's okay and if you look at sort of the way that emotions you know rise and fall in a healthy situation let's say that you know your friend gets dumped and then you all get together you'll have a good cry they tell you what happens you have a good cry you're feeling all that negative emotion you hug each other you know you say some inspiring words i'm so sorry you're going through this all this kind of stuff and at the end of it like both of you feel tired but you feel good about it you feel light you feel like you've let something off of your chest so it's not suppression it's like processing so when our brain handles emotions in a more natural way like there's more processing involved and when we handle emotions through technology all we do is suppress it and as we suppress it what happens it comes back roaring again and again so when i'm afraid that i'm not going anywhere in life and i manage that fear through video games what happens when i stop playing the game fear just comes roaring back or you know this is a lot of people in our community are going somewhere are actually very successful so if you're at your job and you think you're afraid you're gonna get fired because you made a mistake on an important project same damn thing load up a video game forget about the problem for a little while because it's so terrifying that your career could come to an end you're an engineer at one of these highly coveted positions you're making a bunch of money and like what if i get fired then you go log on to the video game and you forget your worries for a little while and then you wake up the next day and you've got to go to work and you're terrified of what your boss is going to say you get a message on slack hey can you swing by my office when you have a second you're terrified can you come by in the afternoon you go on your lunch break what do you do on your lunch break you grab your food you grab your phone and you veg out for a little bit right so it's it's not it you don't have to be successful or unsuccessful that's not the important thing the important thing is what's happening in your mind and how do you respond to it and what role does technology play what role do these platforms like twitch and stuff play all right okay um so we're gonna maybe take a look at one more okay [Music] hey [Music] so you've got a lot of potential you know what you need to do and that's the problem is there's a lot of stuff that you got to do right but why is it so easy to engage in the technology why is it so easy so this is important to understand if we look at why fundamentally technology is addictive a big reason that it's addictive is because it offers you the same rewards that you would get from real life but at a cheaper cost same reward but easier so if you log on to twitch you connect with a streamer they laugh you laugh dr k makes a facial expression you make a facial expression you get that empathic connection but it's easier to do because you don't have to leave the house you don't have to shower you don't have to do laundry right you don't have to sit in traffic you don't have to worry about like whether that one person that you don't like is gonna show up or not and if this is horrible but we've been hearing about this more and more recently in your friend group your ex isn't gonna be like you're you know if you have a friend group and you now were dating someone from your friend group and now they're your ex every time you go hang out with the friend group the x is there so you don't have to deal with that if you form an empathic connection with someone on the internet if you have a friend on discord it's so easy because if you screw up you can just block them you can ignore them you never have to do any kind of damage control in a relationship it's just easy to find someone else to connect to so the challenge with technology is that it gives you the rewards like in your brain it gives you the rewards without going through all the effort and we see this in video games as well right so like we'll see this a lot where people will say i don't understand why i can grind on a video game and like really try to be like one of the best you know top 200 players in the world but i can't bring myself to study for school like both of them are a grind but i can do one very easily i can like i can grind on like this video game for 12 hours a day and try to be the best at something but i can't do that when it comes to like being the best at you know writing haikus and like studying english literature i don't understand because being the best is important to me i get a lot of value out of it and that's where like yeah that's why the games are successful because they give you that reward of achievement right is one of our oldest videos back when dr k was a small childer who first showed up on the internet we posted a video like one of our oldest videos on our youtube channel about the triumph circuit and the whole reason that games are addictive is because they give you that sense of triumph they give you that difficulty with the reward at the end and what our brain has learned to value is not easy things but hard things that we can win at that's the sweet spot if it's too easy it becomes boring if it's too hard it becomes overwhelming both of those lead to a lack of motivation both of them take your motivation why are you motivated towards video games and not motivated towards the other parts of life it's because the the rest of life is either overwhelming or boring compared to video games and this is the key thing to understand is that now your brain has option c it's not which one do i want to do do i want to be boring or do i want to be overwhelmed because if it's irl like those are your two options right either i go to the party and i feel socially anxious for an hour before i kind of get into it and have a good time or i stay home i have no social exposure no social anxiety but then i'm gonna feel bored and lonely those are the options irl and then technology gives us option c ah there's twitch there's discord you get all the conversation with none of the social anxiety and then your brain is like yes i'll take that one so you can study hard and it's going to be boring and you'll get an a at the end which by the way you're going to get the a at the end of the semester so there's going to be a huge delayed gratification and by the way when you get an a in a class how long do you feel good how long does the happiness from getting an a in class last compared to 60 minute game of dota enemy has mega creeps you're about to lose you wipe them in a heroic defense of your base run it down mid and win the game there's no way getting an a in a class is going to reach anywhere near that level of thrill anywhere near that level of triumph and how hard you have to work to get that you just have to sign up for a dota game you don't have to go to a whole semester hours and hours and hours at the library before your award right you don't have to do that so the reward happens so much easier the other interesting thing is what if you're running it down mid after wiping them in your base and they've got mega creeps their throne is at half health and then their creeps are in your base and you lose the game you don't even win at the end it's a base race and you lose what does that do to your motivation do you say screw this game i'm never gonna win play it again no you queue right back up right go next next i was so close i could taste the victory let me do it again i could taste it it was so close now compare that to real life what happens if you get an 89 in a class got a b are you like great awesome next time i'm gonna get an a cue up go next let's let's jump i want to skip the summer break i want to go right into the next semester and i'm going to crush it i'm going to get an a why did i study so hard for an 89 i could have spent half the time at the library playing twice as many video games and i could have gotten 80 would have been the same damn grade waste of my time tanks your motivation so you all want to understand like why is it different why can i do this in a game and why can't i do it in real life there it is because here's what's happening people are figuring out right game developers are figuring out i don't think it's malicious i don't think it's predatory i mean maybe some of them are but i think they're just figuring out what makes cause if you're like a game designer right like think about this for a second what do you want to do you want to make a fun game what makes fun games these razor thin moments epic saves epic wins you know rubber band mechanics because you're trying to make a fun game you're trying to make a game that people enjoy so i don't blame them for it so what should we do right at the end of the day like what's our responsibility i think our responsibility like so you can blame everyone if you want to okay really you can you can say like oh and we hear this a lot from parents especially why doesn't someone do something about it why didn't someone ban the video games burn all the video games stop them take the video their developers to jail they're addicting my kid i don't know that you can alter the world to make your life easy i don't know if you can do that but what you can do is like be aware right you can do things to set yourself up for success you can do things to help yourself set healthy boundaries and i'm not kidding like part of the reason i'm serious like the reason that we took this sponsorship with oneplus is because they actually have a device that like helps you set limits on your device right so there's like tools out there you can do things to set healthy boundaries you can uninstall stuff from your pc if you need to you can also like be more aware of like what the game does to you you can limit the amount that you play and you may say like limiting oh it's so hard but like think about this for a second if i'm going to play 10 hours of video games is the amount of fun the same during all 10 hours no the first couple hours are fun the last couple hours suck you don't even know why you're playing so just be aware of this stuff and the more that you become aware of it the easier it'll be to set boundaries like literally grab a piece of paper and if you're if you play video games for 10 hours a day write down one one through ten for each hour that you play and next to each number just look like rate each one so how much fun did i have over the last hour on a scale of one to ten ten being the most fun i've ever had in my life one being absolutely awful and just do that for a week and look at the numbers and then ask yourself like why am i doing this like what's going on here be aware of what what's going on when you ask yourself why i'm doing this the answer isn't there's no reason to do this no there's a good reason to do it that's why you're doing it and raise that awareness of yourself and as you become aware of it you'll gain power over it so here's the last thing i'll leave you with awareness precedes control everyone is trying to think about how to control things how do i change my behavior how do i control my motivation how do i do this how do i everyone's focusing on the action or the behavior how do i transform my life awareness precedes control if you want to understand this very very well hopefully you all have had or i don't know about hopefully but if you've ever had a situation where you've like had a part of your body that's been numb so often times for like dental work right they'll numb some part of your body and then what happens when you numb it you can't use it properly your control over it disappears since then you like talk all funny right and they tell you not to eat because you're gonna bite your lip and you'll bite your tongue or whatever and so before you're aware of something you can't do anything about it so awareness precedes control in medicine this is also good diagnosis proceeds good treatment sort of similar so be aware of what you're doing and then do the best that you can to set up situations where you can sort of like move in a direction to like account for these things and that's where i think ultimately a healthy relationship with technology comes from because this stuff is here and it sounds like it's here to stay and at the same time like we don't have to despair because it's here it can be a tool for good it can be a source of enjoyment it can be a source of social connection even during the pandemic i was really surprised to discover that a lot of times like the gamers were the ones who were doing the best because we were the ones who had relationships that were virtual that sustained us for years so i know that was definitely the case with me whereas like we had a game night like easy fantastic we've been doing this for years right so we we we're able to keep some of those connections so don't be afraid of technology it's not evil but respect it understand that it is playing with fire and you can accomplish a lot with it but if you're not careful you're gonna get burned okay so just uh a reminder that this is a segment of a sponsored stream we're going to actually wrap up so we're being sponsored by oneplus which is a phone company and part of the reason that we're we took this sponsorship is because the oneplus phone actually has features that are designed to limit your use so they've got zen mode they've got work life mode they've got these different things that you can do that will sort of disable notifications or allow some notifications in and out so that if you are in work mode like you know you'll get some things that are work related but you won't get things that'll distract you from work this is exactly i think what phones need to be doing or what tools we need to develop and so that's kind of why we took it the other cool thing is that oneplus has been kind enough to sponsor coaching for y'all so that's another thing that we tend to look for from our sponsors is we want people who are actually willing to like help our community as opposed to just help us and so we're grateful to them so you can use the the command exclamation point giveaway if you're someone who's looking for coaching whether it's career coaching or group coaching where you want to like practice social skills and and things like that or you're like looking to get life purpose understand yourself better like try to figure out why you're you're struggling with motivation all those kinds of things are what we sort of do with coaching and if that's something that you're interested in you know use the exclamation point giveaway command um and the last thing is what we're grateful for is we also recognize that there are a lot of people in our community who may not be able to afford our coaching services part of what we really do believe in though is that our coaches are not volunteers that you know they get compensated for the work that they do and so thankfully oneplus is is offered to sponsor some of those coaching packages so that's why we're doing this you
