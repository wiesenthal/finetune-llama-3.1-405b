i i'm noticing that y'all are sort of almost answering the question from like a developmental psychology sort of way where we're focusing on parenting as to why they were the way they were but i'm more thinking like on a more existential level do you all ever wonder about why your life is the way it is hello okay we're live all right we live we're live no baby so we're gonna hop right in okay so welcome everybody how's everybody doing today you're doing good uh i i i i'd be kind of tired not gonna lie me too slight oh someone's paying attention all right zell what's the not polite answer uh i have a lot of things going on okay trying to figure it out so uh if we're being honest with ourselves i'm doing fine but on the edge okay so would zell have said that three weeks ago probably not on the first day you know i don't think so so have been like wow this guy's too real yeah right so so okay so it's interesting because metric says this person is too real so how is zell like how have we made him more real what's changed or we didn't make him more real but you know how is he able to be more real by not being polite just to make everyone else comfortable okay like yeah and by opening up a little sure and what do we have to do that allows zell to be able to say something like that we have to bring it up in a you know kind of authentic way right yeah so like zell like did y'all i don't know if y'all were kind of paying attention but we're going to teach all over the course the next couple weeks to pay attention to all kinds of minimal things right so zell kind of put his toes in the water did you all get that sense yeah what did he say do you all remember right you mean for right now or yeah like what did he say when he's like i was like how's everybody doing today right that's a polite introduction yeah polite answer i'm okay i'm fine and then i said i'm good and then he was like actually i'm fine but there's a lot on my plate yeah right so he like started off polite just like ash said and then as smirky kind of pointed out he kind of put his toes in the water and that's where we've got an interesting opportunity so if we pay attention people are going to say things like that they're going to be like oh you know i've got nothing to complain about does that mean you're doing well and so sometimes what we've got to do is like dig in a little bit right and then now we're going to see because we're going to go to our standard check-in and things like that but then the group basically has a choice do we want to try to support zell in a more explicit way and the group also has a concern because is it okay to ask why zell is borderline fine like what's the he's at the edge of the cliff what's the cliff what's going on in your life is this a safe enough place to discuss that are we interested in hearing it are we okay with zell sharing it right makes sense so i i think we've also heard from other people so so part of i'll lay out a couple of other things so at let's say we do explore it with zell we're just going to preempt this i'm going to give you all a road map for today as we start to ask zel questions how is zell gonna feel the more we get into his stuff nervous good why targeted yep i don't know good why we're just focusing on him yes right we're putting you under the microscope yes yes how do we help him feel like he's not under the microscope maybe we make it feel more like a conversation and less like an interview and how do we do that metric um we don't interrogate him so much but find ways to get him to share of his own volition okay that's gonna be a goal ruby maybe we could share how we're feeling but 100 and then ask them if they want to talk about it absolutely right so i think metrics right so metric pointed out a very good word interrogation what are the hallmark what's the hallmark of an interrogation question after question after question after question if we fall into that pattern then zell is going to be he's going to feel under the microscope so this is where i don't think it is a coincidence that zerg girl and ash were the two that sort of shared how zell could potentially feel because i think if we got into y'all's stuff y'all would probably feel the same way right yeah so this is where what we can try to do to take some of the heat off of zell as if something says something that resonates with us we can share something ourselves and then we're going to shift the conversation a little bit towards ourselves but the key thing is since it's related to what zell is saying hopefully as we share a bunch of different experiences the group can get an overall like global understanding of like how to deal with these problems make sense questions yes we don't necessarily have to do that i'm just kind of laying that out okay so i'm gonna be looking to and i want you all to understand what's your responsibility here if it feels like something zell is saying is resonating with you you can share yourself that'll make help zell feel more comfortable and but we still don't want to ask him questions and then we'll sort of like as more people start to share hopefully those people will start to invite questions okay so before we jump into that um what i'd like i love to start off with if people are okay is why don't we do check-ins so tell us a little bit about how the last week or two has been for you um uh do i guess we should also do introductions because i think there are some people here that haven't met each other so um i think uh you all feel okay with that so i think especially zerg girl and probably miss ashrocks need to because i think everyone else has met both of them right y'all are the only two that so just introduce yourself a little bit um ash and zur girl and then you know what you go by tell us a little bit about how the last week has been for you ups and downs um and then the last thing is we talked a little bit about homework last week if you all have had a chance to do it you can share what you kind of learned who remembers what the homework was um one or three expectations where is it rooted from and a couple i forgot the rest but those are the main points of our homework yeah so the homework doesn't have to be followed literally it's not graded we also understand that y'all are content creators have jobs et cetera so you may not have time for it the goal is to really solidify some of the understanding from the last week and does anyone want to start by sort of sharing a little bit about what did y'all take away from last week expectation is the source of suffering okay that's what my notes say i was just sat here trying to remember last week i'm like huh [Laughter] yeah so it's it's okay to forget right we're not but also wasn't that one of the things is like actually paying attention to stuff and like taking new small nuances in of when people talk and share and sure and so here's the thing ruby even if you can't when put on the spot remember what we talked about last week it's okay because some of it was sinking in and we'll build on it over time so expectation is the source of suffering what do people think about that i mean he had it's part of zell's notes but is that just the wisdom of dr k or do you guys think that that is like actually it's not my wisdom but you know what do y'all think about that i mean i think i feel like that but it's not necessarily true um so okay good yeah so good i feel like there's good expectations and then unrealistic expectations okay yeah that's that's kind of something that i kind of got from the homework was i wrote down like what my expectation was but i was like by writing it down and showing someone else they could say well that's a really good thing and i my expectation was that i'm i'm always expecting myself to be improving and growing and learning and it's something i've had since i was a kid and most people would say that's a good thing but i think healthy expectations is probably the key word when it comes to it because people be like oh improving growing learning that's all great not when it becomes anxiety-inducing um and overwhelming so yeah okay great so i think this is a great time to segue into actual check-ins so who wants to go first i can go first i'll take it i'll take the totem so excuse me sorry hold on water well let's see we chatted last thursday and the next day i was diagnosed with alopecia i've been seeing a lot of my hair thinning over the last year and a half so i figured it was going to come to that point but i wasn't sure but i felt validated i went to the dermatologist and got the diagnosis i did a scalp biopsy so that's been interesting to recover from and it's kind of like okay black women are affected by this how do i feel about this new diagnosis so i'm trying to figure out how do i feel about it how do i move on with life with that diagnosis and deal with it especially after i get answers i'll have to figure out what's my next steps and i'm with the thought of that i don't want to think negative because it's something that just happened it's out of my control so i'm content with it i feel okay with it and it's something that's just a part of my journey now that i can share with my community and the world and bring awareness to it what black women are going through so that's been the number one stressor of the last week but i'm finding a balance i'm just trying to figure out how to make it into a positive thing um to share with my community and um every day since our last session i've been thinking about expectations and i say unrealistic for me because my expectations were i expect to do my best in everything that i do i expect to treat myself with love every single day i expect to bring energy and joy to every space that i'm in and i think they're they're good expectations i don't think they're unrealistic but sometimes it can be if i don't feel up to it so you can have your bad days and i think it's important to talk about that as content creators you can't be happy all the time so i'm trying to focus more on that especially with i'm grieving right now i've been grieving since last year since october so it's like i have a lot of things that i have to work through to be okay every day i wake up every day thinking about my grandma you know um i don't want to cry but it is something that i deal with every day because it's affected me every single day ever since she passed away and i'm sorry don't be sorry um but it's just always things piling up and i'm just trying to set those expectations to wake up and be okay with her passing and trying to be happy this day so i have a lot to work on and i think grieving affects people differently so i'm working through it and i hope to learn from every single one of you how you do with things because i i like how i started off and i was in a good headspace and then i immediately went to the negative and yeah that's kind of how my brain goes i'll be like oh i'm on a high path right now and i'm like wait this is also stressing me out and i need to think about how to deal with that but then i'll run away from it i'm like no it's okay i'm thinking about happy thoughts about her it's fine i'm okay with this she's gone so yeah that's what i'm dealing with on a daily basis and on top of the new diagnosis um figuring out how i can do better with it and spread awareness in the best way possible so i just try to utilize content creation to be the best version of myself still learning how to be a creator and still learning how to be a better human being all around so that's where expectations really affect me sometimes so i have to figure out a balance between healthy ones and ones that are realistic so didn't want to cry sorry nothing wrong with it yeah i i think everyone in here is with you and like you know if uh if we're feeling emotional or something you know i think it's better for us to let it out than versus trying to keep it in and being you know quote unquote polite so yeah so thank you i just did my makeup so you know that's money [Laughter] so that was a little bit of my homework and how i'm feeling so for the sake of ash's makeup let's keep it positive today thank you for sharing this but not false positive just correct genuine positivity authentic positivity yeah yeah i remembered and what is that metric it's it's it's it's not platitudes and and um you know just building people up for no reason when we could actually be supportive for a cause as opposed to just being like you can do anything or yeah don't worry ash you got this that that would be terrible yeah it's okay it sounds like temporarily but it has no concrete progression yeah like it's okay to like embrace the negativity rather than like always running away from it right at least at least that's kind of the perspective that i see because like um i know that it is you know because when you try to stay positive so much as someone who tends to be positive all the time and that's how people see you it can be um a little not daunting but kind of like i don't know you just kind of get like an entire new perspective when things aren't always positive and maybe you are dabbling a little bit in the negativity of a situation but i think you know when yeah when it when when you're able when you're able you have the strength to embrace it to tackle it head-on um i think there's a lot of like value in that i wanted to say like you say you always go to the negative i didn't feel like any of that was you going to the negative like i felt that you were just sharing how what you're what you're feeling and what you're going through and also by sharing you are doing all of those things that you were saying because by sharing you're helping other people and you're sharing your story as well which is a very like human and if you were to have hidden those parts away then that would have been the toxic positivity and so i really appreciate you for being so open and honest and and sharing like you got me all choked up my my name means a lot to me as well it's i don't want to take too much time i'm sorry um yeah i think her passing just really shifted my life and i'm still trying to deal with it um if you want more details um my mom was working for my grandma doing in-home care for her taking care of her so that was her job and now that that's gone i am head of household which i'm totally fine with but the reasoning for it is like why did this happen um really with her passing it's really traumatic i don't want to go into details but it's just really traumatic i i don't want to cause any kind of visuals for you guys it just i just found her so it's just still an image that pops in my head and that's like my daily stress pretty much and i'm trying to work through it i am going to therapy and talking about it um especially taking care of my mom that was her mom so try to stay strong for her and myself is it's a lot i think i'm doing good because i'm crying when i can but not i feel like i'm not crying enough because i keep sheltering my feelings and just trying not to think about it but i think i need to talk about it more and just talk vent it out i think i mean literally coming back to you know today's topic feeling like you're not crying enough isn't that like an expectation that you're putting on yourself as far as handling your grief yeah which might not be you know helpful to you right so i think i think if you're gonna cry you're to cry like i remember i lost my grandfather and i i was just so weird about it because it was very i was not close to him at all but it was something that i was almost expecting to maybe come to terms with them one day because i'd been estranged from him for like about 95 of my life and only in like the last couple years did i actually like get to talk to him again and then nothing really got resolved i remember one day in the supermarket i was just buying stuff and it reminded me of him and i just broke down and yeah i was like oh i definitely got to deal with this because i'm you know it's like kinking the hose it's it's you don't have control when it snaps right so um yeah i would i would definitely talk more and if you're gonna cry you're gonna cry so yeah thank you so much for sharing that i know i didn't really say much because i wanted to hear what everyone else has to say it's like my grandma she's i think she's got alzheimer's or going through some dementia so it's been really hard to experience that as well i think you have incredible composure and even just coming here to share that with us and everyone else on the stream i have a lot of respect for you because i know if i talk about it more in detail i'm going to be a mess i probably can't even articulate well so i definitely can't right now i'm like well the lashes are staying on so we're good you're looking good you look great but yeah i just wanted to share that with you all i opened up another can of worms for myself because that's it's just it just keeps packing on and stacking up and i'll find myself doing really good for two or three weeks i'm like oh we're good we're we're great and i'm like nope i'm crumbling again because i'm thinking about her and that how i found her and why it happened i tend to question a lot why did this happen why did i have to do this why did i have to find her this way so that's another thing that doesn't happen as often but i tend to question a lot of things that happen in my life just speaking into a void i don't know if anybody else can relate with that oh yeah yeah why did this happen no answer you're like okay let me try to figure it out or maybe it's best that i don't i just try to do better the next time or whatever maybe so i am done for now right now so we'll give other people a chance to check in so awesome interaction you know i think um don't worry by the way all about sharing too much or you know i know that y'all may be concerned but keep in mind that i'll be keeping track of stuff right so that's part of my role here is to make sure that people get the time that they need um and that we also acknowledged right at the you know the first group that like particular days we're going to spend a little bit more time on particular people which is totally fine i do think it'll be worthwhile if other people want to take a moment to check in and tell us how your week has been if you managed to do the homework you know if there were any kind of takeaways from it or lessons that you learned um yeah so since last week it feels like i've blinked and we're here at thursday again um it's been one of those like weeks and i've done the thing that i normally do which is i can do everything and um i went to a festival at the weekend and i've still managed to stream my same amount of hours and not really take any time off um so i i think like today that hit me because i just wasn't in the right mindset for stream today and i should have probably taken today off um and yeah then i didn't go to my like pole class i normally go to like a exercise class before i come here so i did one good thing you know i even though i paid for the class already like i i cancelled and and relaxed before coming here because i knew that like coming to talk after like knowing that i've over exerted myself and trying to do too much and put too much expectations on myself would just end in me being really like either emotional for no reason um kind of like a little like mental burnout um [Music] or yeah not not focused or not get much out of this session um [Music] so i did my homework on stream today just asking chat and i i only i picked i only found like one thing to always be improving growing and learning but i think it kind of covers a lot of things and [Music] i realized it's like come from [Music] um [Music] as a kid i started dancing when i was three um and i've always been like graded as a person um on my performance and the more i started to like think about this so you'd get marks for like appearance you'd get marks you know for you know how your hair how neat your hair was um and your uniform and um how you presented yourself and how polite you were and and all of these things would like you'd get a grade and that expectation to be always this shiny happy performing child um [Music] kind of like it fell apart in my 20s when i actually just didn't turn up to an exam and didn't answer the telephone um i actually went to work instead i decided not to go to an exam and went to work instead and ignored my telephone and um yeah i didn't do like one of my final exams um rebellious 21 year old um but i i still enjoyed dancing and stuff and i realized that i've carried some of that into my life now in my expectations of myself um in my expectations of being able to do it all as well because as a kid i would get signed up to do like a gazillion different dance disciplines go to this school do that get this scholarship do this thing and um [Music] there were a lot of expectations for me as a child um that went through into like my adulthood which then i've realized i've carried on into my own expectations of what i'm doing um so yeah that's kind of what i was thinking about today um but i had an amazing time at the festival and i danced i haven't like i found really like sheltered i haven't gone out to like a festival or something and just like i was doing around 16 000 steps a day just dancing um and yeah just enjoying myself until i like ran out of energy and meeting lots of really nice people and um it was a bit of a wellness festival so there was like some sound baths in the day there was some like different things going on in the day but i just allowed myself to be for a weekend not to be like the only events i normally go to are twitchcon streaming events places where i have to be ruby the streamer and it was so nice to go somewhere where i bet if i asked people there if they knew what twitch was nobody would know and that was really nice and kind of like a bit of a um like i don't want to quit streaming but also it was like oh hang on there's this whole thing out there and there's people out there like connecting and like i know you can do that online but yeah it was a nice it was a nice like quite literally putting my feet back in the mud um experience like you know you can become quite clinical and quite in a little box at your computer and your world like can become like a fish tank online and it's just the same fish like swimming around you check all the same social media and um i can yeah i feel energized but also i know i've done too much and like i maybe should have taken a me day which i'm very i find it very hard to take me days um even if it's a day off um my mods joke like if they see me online like this is a day off get off discord like get off get off here what are you doing like you better not be working i'll be like i'm just researching this and they'll be like why it's a day off i'll be like i'm just going to do a bit of this course over here that i'm reading about and they'll yeah i find it very hard to not always be productive so that comes back to my expectations of it everything has to feel like it's getting somewhere but i did nothing all weekend except for dance and that did get me somewhere so you can yeah it's like a reminder that i can have enjoyment and stuff and it doesn't have to be connected to twitch and my work and yeah so yeah that was my week so i'm hearing that ruby was able to get somewhere by going nowhere yes exactly that's deep you should have had some of the conversations this weekend well absolutely where you're dancing 16 000 steps a day those conversations would have been deep we made touchdowns oh go ahead comment it's cool how like when you're when you i guess like envelope yourself in a whole different um kind of performance like you can get so much out of it right whether it's doing dance or for me all throughout school like singing in choir and like connecting musically with my peers um i have like some of my best experiences doing things outside of content creation and you know i think like a lot of people especially while i was in school were asking me like the million-dollar golden question like how do you balance having a life and then like having content creation and um like you know and doing both of those um and i don't know i don't see it as like a perfect balance but it's something that like can be done and you can't you can't take the time to you know invest in those other areas that like personally interest you so i don't know like hearing you share about like your you know experiences outside of twitch with like dance kind of made me uh reflect on those days and how important it is to like have some kind of outlet or some kind of connection to that other thing that is like really valuable to me or to that other person i i i definitely think it's important so um thanks for sharing that ah thank you yeah i i'm one of those people that gets really emotional if i see someone doing something that they are clearly passionate about it doesn't matter what it is if it's like a creative thing or they're just dancing or they're just singing you don't have to be the best they just have to be like trying to swear really enjoying it and doing it do you know what i mean and i just love seeing people do that and i saw so much of that this weekend and it just like reminded me that everything can get so stuffy and picky and and like yeah with especially online and just like go outside and just sing if you want to touch grass if you want to sing sing like if you want to dance dance like i sound like i'm giving some big speech here but like like smirky was saying it's it feeds like a different part of you that some people i think can forget when they spend so much time creating content you've always got to think about what am i creating but when you go and do those things i actually have come back and i'm like even clear about what i want to create absolutely um so we'll talk a little bit about that i just want to kind of acknowledge the time so we've been doing this for about 35 minutes and we've checked in with two people so we also have to decide as a group do we wanna i think it's good to do tangents we should just be aware of whether we wanna check in with people or we wanna go off on tangents how do people feel i don't mind the tangents personally um and i also want to make sure everyone gets the chance to check in too so it's just like internal conflict for me at least yeah i'm i'm okay same so so what i'll do today is let's try to have a little bit more focus check check-in make sure we give everyone a chance to check in and then what we'll do is sort of like there are a bunch of different useful themes that we can kind of dive into um and and so then we'll kind of like put that to the group and sort of pick one particular thing so it's also nice to have tangents and at the same time i also think if we do focus the discussion like if we kind of pick something and and work with a little bit more intention that we can sort of learn something that we can kind of take away which also has to be balanced with sort of like sharing and getting things off our chest and things like that so why don't we have other people kind of check in i can go since i was talking just a moment ago i feel like it flows well um uh it's kind of interesting for me because i've always like associated the idea of expectations as like this kind of negative idea or negative thought like as as it's like um you know if you have too many expectations on yourself you can burn out you know it can result to all these different things so i mean like i certainly do put expectations on myself at times especially like you know being in school is one thing but streaming as well um but i guess i've always like kind of silently nodded at them rather than being like yeah like i have all these expectations and this is how i want to go about it because i i guess maybe it's on the topic of avoidance i guess um just like i don't know i've seen it as this like negative theme for a while but i just kind of like put that to the side when i was like thinking about you know just straight up all things you know to the side because i overthink a lot so just putting all that over here and being like okay in this moment like you know what are my expectations um and i guess like a couple things that come up just i want to you know inspire others to like be inspiring with their lives and the people around them um so i want to make sure i do my best and you know uplift uplift both myself as well as others and then um i also you know just want to make sure that whatever it is i'm creating i'm truly having fun with it um that you know because the whole reason i started streaming getting into content creation is because i just thought it would be fun when i was playing toontown to share my own experiences with other people and that was that was the baseline that was it um and it's so easy to lose sight of it so i kind of like um not like hammering in this expectation but just like reminding myself every now and then of like you know why i started it um why i started getting into streaming in the first place um i think it kind of just sets the stage for so many other things whether i'm doing a charity fundraiser or i'm just chilling out with my community um you know it's kind of like the backbone to everything so yeah that's uh those are my i guess expectations that i came up with cool thank you for sharing who's next i can go next um i can share what my week what my weeks were like uh apologies for missing the last time i was at a work off site but past couple weeks i was going to pax west in seattle and then after that i had to go to work in san diego like immediately after seattle so it's just been really hectic and ever since these sessions started i think i only streamed like two or three times even though i told myself i was gonna start up streaming again after work like having a schedule going but i feel like i've been kind of overwhelmed because i was moving from one city to another so just setting up my whole station here and then dealing with moving and then all these events that were happening and during pax derude was playing at one of the nightclubs and i was very excited i was like this is great timing there's the rude it's the gamer's meme and there's packs happening and i was just so tired i couldn't even go i thought that was so sad the stars aligned for that night and i just couldn't make it i went to bed at like 10 p.m or something so i'm kind of the opposite of you all that i could not really get back to content creation and then for this week i just had so many work meetings and at the end of it i was like i'm so exhausted i just can't play starcraft i can't really talk or do anything i'm just gonna watch tv shows and veg out or something um i think i just need to get my [ __ ] together so that that's been my week my weeks okay i'm kind of curious um and by the way so for miss ashrocks and zerg girl can y'all please just share with us what y'all prefer to be what y'all prefer to go by in terms of how we should address you oh oh sorry miss ash or ash whatever is shorter and easier for y'all those work for me yeah whatever is easier um i think zerg girl is kind of a mouthful so kathy is good okay call me cathy so i'm i'm curious when y'all hear kathy say get my [ __ ] together what do you all hear i see zell smile smile knowingly i i was gonna ask like what does that mean like what is what do you what do you mean by getting your [ __ ] together because i think like it means so it's uh you know we talked about it week one talking about our ambiguity and digging in a little bit so yeah there's a lot more things i didn't mention i feel like it's kind of macroing my life like i signed up for a new credit card so i have to look into that it was all this paperwork that came in i was like i'm gonna read this later so i procrastinate on that there was a health appointment that i had to forego because another meeting was scheduled and then just even missing this group session um i'm so i'm so sorry producers i didn't even give notice because i was just so distracted with everything so that's why i'm like okay i need to you know be more on top of things my scheduling like um doing the things that i want just just trying to balance everything i hope that makes more sense maybe we'll dig in a little bit let's dig in a little bit later let's give people a chance to finish checking it i think we've got metric and zell left right you want to go or i'll go doesn't matter to me uh okay i'm okay with it either um i'll go uh so uh like almost two weeks ago i accidentally damaged a tendon in my foot that almost made me thought i like fractured it or broke it or something and i couldn't walk for a bunch of days and uh it was it was very painful i couldn't sleep but my folks were like how about you come up here and put your foot up because i live on the third floor of a house and it's all stairs so you know having a wrecked foot wasn't exactly easy to deal with on my own which it worked out um and i ended up reading four books while it was up there because i can't stream while i'm up there and there's nothing else to do so i felt really good just reading because i feel like one thing that died when i started streaming was actually reading um that that was actually really cool to to get that back and i was worried that like my reading speed had gone down since i used to i used to just consume books um and then like initially when i started back up again i was like why is this taking so long um am i stupid now and then eventually it just uh the books just like osmosed through my skull or something so i'm i'm i'm glad i have that back um but yeah uh and then i finally got back monday no tuesday tuesday tuesday and then i had my first stream back yesterday after like ages and it felt really good and it felt like i didn't even like miss a stride at all so i'm really happy about that and i can't wait to to just hit the ground running with like an actual working foot i came back to it anyway um so um as far as like expectations and stuff i think i have a few that kind of messed me up and as far as like they they go against each other uh so i kind of one thing i do is i i expect to procrastinate on anything that i intend to work on i know that it's not gonna happen right away um it's that idea of like i don't expect to wake up tomorrow and like adopt all of those habits that are supposed to like automatically fix my life um and even then i'm gonna wreck that like it's gonna be even slower than other people would adopt it so uh i'm really good at waiting till the last minute until it's absolutely critical and then like possibly even begging for an extension on whatever work it was i'm i'm so good at that it's a talent and i it shouldn't be um so i know that's something that keeps me from seizing opportunities uh or even pushing ahead for myself and the other thing is and this probably goes against the idea of like dreaming in general or like putting yourself out there is i i thought about this really hard is that i expect to be put down or like made fun of or like i expect a negative reaction from the things that i do and say uh in in groups or streams and stuff and it's it's it's really weird because like i fostered this really caring community and everyone's really nice to me and stuff and it's great but i i always have like these hairs on the back of my neck that go up just ready just ready for somebody to like be brutal to me and it's not because i don't trust them it's it's a matter of i i had to think really hard i spent two decades of therapy um because of my father he was an extremely violent man who never um adjusted to life in canada or the first world really after immigrating here and um he kind of saw family as like the wife stays at home you marry off the daughter and the son takes up your work and uh it it i i was not following his footsteps because i was kind of an egghead still am but uh he he didn't even like the day that i got glasses because i couldn't see um and uh so he was particularly violent he stopped being violent with me when i got bigger than him um and then one day i just couldn't take it anymore and uh i kicked him out of the house when i was 16 and that was the only fight i've ever been in um and i packed his bags for him and threw him on the driveway and he's gone uh so i don't have a relationship with him or anything but like those 16 years were constant like shame and abuse and i think i've sort of internalized that to like you know all these waking moments of even trying to be happy or or entertain or whatever um like i expect somebody to just come out of nowhere and be like well you suck or that's not gonna happen or why would you even try because that's how i grew up right so yeah anyway sorry to bring down the moon you're not bringing down the mood has everyone gone yet oh i guess it's i guess it's me um austin so all right i uh the check-in part um so anyways uh like i right now it's just a big transitional period in my life so it's like the time to start uh reassessing a lot of things taking a lot of self look at stuff um and uh yeah it's been it's been difficult so um just kind of reassessing everything in my life really just like from the ground up and redefining myself and um that's just been kind of the the big theme and like on top of that it's like i i'm starting to think about you know working a full-time job again uh and like making content creation maybe a secondary thing um also moving sucks you know i you know like when uh or kathy uh you were talking about moving i was like i hate moving moving is the worst thing in the world um so yeah i uh i they're just a lot of stuff physically mentally emotionally everything so that's my check-in um i know i was being vague there but uh they're just some stuff i'm not really ready to share quite yet um and then moving on to expectations uh so for me my expectation is i always want to be the best like pokemon song i want to be the very best like in everything that i've ever done i want to be the best like oh i pick up a new video game i better be like top one percent uh if i play like sports i want to be mvp i if i sing a song i want to be the best singer at that song i want to be the best guitarist i want to be the best violinist i want to be the best at everything i do like it's like a it's like an all-consuming thing and i know where that comes from because like you know i was just pushed super super super hard as a kid you know kind of classic scenario immigrant family it comes down to the us and um and especially being korean like the korean education system is just about grinding grinding grinding grinding being competitive as possible um you know so like i go to school and then my parents have well it was really my mom who had like extra textbooks for me to go into and stuff i think the funny thing was that my parents had nothing no idea how to educate children like my parents had to arrange marriage they didn't know what the heck they were doing and so all they knew how to do was to just push me in whatever direction that i was able to go into and and so that turned into like me doing sports me doing academics at any rate possible like i was in a i was in an accelerated program that was like meant for a little bit i think older kids but i went in at the minimum age so i start i stopped i i did math i did calculus by the time i was in eighth grade and i did multi-variable uh ninth grade like i was done with college math by the time i went into high school and then i was a violin competitor so i competed nationally uh in violin i was less good at sports because i'm not like a big dude so i played soccer but even in soccer my my club team made it to state and so did that like it was just competition all my life just be the best be the best be the best and um my parents were just doing the best they could but like you know culturally and just from them too that's a whole other story um with like how my parents kind of didn't know how to do anything really and so i sort of had to even though they were pushing me this hard they weren't actually helpful to me right like even though they can throw these textbooks in front of me and say like oh you have to practice this much violin or practice this much whatever they don't play violin they don't know calculus they just knew that if they just push me uh you know you you just the kid does it and so for me like um part of the expectation is like my own self-sufficiency i know i think it was last week or maybe the week before we talked about like you know things that i want to work on which is like asking for help well turns out that was a learned like behavior for me to never ask for help because i've never had anyone to rely on uh in my life and like my growing up i was also very poor so i knew financially like i had to take care of myself and um it's different now my parents actually are doing pretty decently good for them um but like i you know i i just it was always just about figuring out things for me and so now as an adult i yeah i just have this expectation and part of it isn't on my own because like i like being good at things so i think there it isn't just like this forced expectation that uh that every like came into my life i guess like just i i want to be there too and then like i um another expectation is just about like financial stability being like independent and yeah so that's kind of the nutshell okay to the korean parents just real fast yeah i mean it's like as classic as it gets and but the devils i think in the details i think that's the part that was kind of funny about it is just like how much they just didn't actually understand because i don't think they were really ready to be parents like yeah like i said they had a arranged marriage and then uh like literally my grandparents were like have a kid and so like nine months later there i was so my parents had known each other for a year and a half maybe by the time they had me and like yeah so when did you sleep so i also had really bad um insomnia as a kid like i normally just didn't sleep very much it wasn't until like college where i started to have a more normal sleep um thing i i got sleep testing done uh recently too yeah god that's crazy kathy i'm curious if there was something that resonated with you about zell's upbringing that he was sharing yeah the korean parents they're just like oh why aren't you doing well in school there's all these people here they can't even speak english and they're getting better grades than you i'm like thanks mom that made me feel amazing thanks mom very cool yeah so it's just tough so we've got a couple of choices all right so we're almost about an hour in we've got half an hour left so i i'd like to wow so i'm just trying to think about can i think for a second yes of course so the challenge is that there's so much to talk about so i'm going to just start spitting stuff out so first of all i want to point something out so metric was like sorry for making things like toning down the mood and everyone was like you didn't tone down the mood like what did patrick do to the mood absolutely nothing it's hard it's hard when you say something and you're like oh man who wants to say anything after that like what do you say after that that's that's the part like i'm i'm gonna go out on a limb here and say that a lot of y'all have said stuff right whether it's kicking out your dad at the age of 16 whether it's you know doing violin competitions i thought he said violent competition so i was like wow like real like cage match kind of stuff here i've heard a lot of things about korean parents but never whenever quite that and then also we're hearing about you know kathy has a loved one who's got dementia ash has has lost someone and has just been given a diagnosis like i actually think a lot of y'all are bringing down the mood so here's the wild thing is that okay yeah yeah so we have to talk about these things right be comfortable so so we have absolutely like we have this reflexive reaction that i'm not allowed to bring down the mood for anyone else but i mean what what the [ __ ] do you call it when you have a violent dad that you have to kick out of the house at the age of 16. like you know that's not fun or exciting and this is the challenge with negativity as we try so hard to block negativity that like you don't have to block it like my question is so so many of y'all need to be better kathy's got to get her [ __ ] together ash has to be positive i try to think about the good things when it comes to my grandmother zell has to be like straight up perfect right and like is it okay to not be okay like everyone's trying to be okay and y'all are nodding your heads as if the answer is yes but i don't think the answer is yes like think about it for a second yeah i was like like i had to catch myself i was like i'm about to say yes but it's so automatic like something i always tell people but like think about it right right so i'm gonna ask y'all does kathy need to get her [ __ ] together yes yes therefore it's okay it's not okay for her to not have her [ __ ] together right doesn't ash need to get over her grandmother who died a year ago zell or at least well i mean i i would just feel terrible for her if if you know it ate away at her for the rest of her life like i think coming to terms with it in some way that would be yeah right so so i was like i didn't want to say yes but i wanted you to get better like feel better yeah i don't think getting over the right word good right so so i'm remember my my my aspect is that i'm purposefully hyperbolic and i want you all to push back yes right but like i'm almost i'm very confident that there are times in ash's life where her mind produces the thought you should be over this by now right absolutely there are times where just like kathy she says i gotta get my [ __ ] together there are times where just like zelle who's at the cliff which he's not by the way thank you for telling us that you're not ready to go into it yet totally fine really love that limit setting right so like th this is one theme for today i think a couple of things so we talked a little bit about i almost want to say like we can just talk about struggling because i think something that we haven't really talked about sort of quite as explicitly like we recognize that people are struggling but like what does it mean to struggle what is your struggle actually like can you tell us about that another thing that we can talk about this is also a little bit off the beaten path not part of our original curriculum but we can talk about meaning and this question of like why is this happening to me and there's some very interesting science behind that question and that exploration it's not something that i had anticipated because frankly i didn't know about y'all's backstories but now that i hear about your backstories like there's a lot of stuff to learn about meaning and like why was why did zell have the parents that he had why didn't kathy have the parents that she had why was she destined to be in a city where darude was playing and she was too tired to go you know or ash who's struggling with diagnoses and stresses and stuff like that and that story by the way we haven't heard the full story yet right there's a lot more to learn there about relationship with parents and alzheimer's dementia like there's a bunch of stuff to talk about so i'm i'm going to kind of put it to y'all so we can sort of oh and then the fourth thing is i feel like at some point we're going to have a have to have a frank conversation about how we feel about ourselves so like i i don't know how else to put it i mean i don't know if that makes sense i can explain it more if you guys want but like i have a feeling that and that's where we got i don't know if we're ready for that if we're if we leveled up enough to where we can have an authentic conversation because what's going to happen is if as we really start to get into it about how we feel about ourselves the group has to be ready to listen to it and not shut it down so i'll i'll put it to y'all in terms of how we want to spend the remainder of the time we can sort of dig into how we feel about ourselves we can dig into meaning we can dig into a couple of these other topics like grief loss um and i even forget what the other stuff that i said at the beginning was but oh yeah just generally speaking like heaviness and that it's okay to be heavy and it's okay to not be okay what are you all feeling i want to dive into meaning and and how the yeah the path of how you want to talk about that among us all here dr k okay people have like oh can i ask like because meaning just sounds kind of broad yep exactly and the grand scheme of things so like because are we gonna focus it from a content creation angle or are we going from a general perspective yeah that's a great question so here's what i would propose since we've got only about 20 minutes left what i would really propose is that next week we're gonna do more focused dives into meaning and people's experiences i don't think we have quite the time to open that up and this week what i'd probably do is maybe ask a couple of questions but then in about five or ten minutes i'd share some perspectives and i'd offer some kind of like educational stuff about the science of meaning and narrative in someone's life so if that kind of makes sense just given time so i think we do exploration next week but we can frame things this week with some explicit teaching i think that sounds good that sounds good to me okay so i'm going to start with somewhat targeted questions okay just a couple of like questions why does stuff happen like why what do y'all think life yeah but because i exist i feel like my one of my friends put it best like when i was i always felt like i was on the back foot because it would always go against my plans or things i was trying to do and she told me like life is a thing that happens when you're making plans so it's just you're you're basically you're trying to strategize your next day but you don't even know if you're gonna get hit by a car tomorrow so like you're just rolling with it basically or trying your best to yeah but what determines how life happens so like you oh okay so so that's one perspective right so i i'm gonna challenge that perspective a little bit so like i'm gonna put myself in i don't know if it's just you know i'm the child of immigrant parents as well so i can sort of i'm sure that my experience is somewhat similar to metrics because i think we're both indian but yeah um you know i think i resonate a lot with zell's experience and and kathy's experience as well and like i'm imagining that they asked themselves when they were growing up why are my parents this way why can't they be different like did y'all ask yourselves that question oh yeah so what was i i'm curious you don't have to have the right answer i i really want to know though what was the answer that you came up with it doesn't have to be rational or justifiable or defensible i mean for like the way i always thought about it because like i feel like i've more or less come to terms with my parents in my like upbringing and they just did the best they could based off their own experiences and i think that's kind of like this cycle that happens right you know where your parents did what their parents did for them in hopes that that was good for them and then that just kind of continues down the cycle and then the why a lot of it i think comes down to just existentialism a little bit where like i think people want their offspring to do well what whether like the things that they're doing to their children is for that like actual goal or not like that's their intent uh and so i think like why things happen just kind of comes down to well they want the best for their kids they just are doing things based off their own experience and knowledge that they have as best they can okay in my experience it wasn't really like that because my both my parents came from very abusive homes like in from in other countries and they both immigrated at the same time and my mom made sure to get therapy and come to terms with everything that happened to her whereas my father didn't do anything to recognize what was going on with him um and it always blew my mind when he was watching tv we would like watch sitcoms or whatever of like happy families and he could never like understand or at least put himself in that situation like well this family isn't like this why are we watching people on tv that are acting in a completely different way like it always sort of the disconnect blew my mind so i mean i think in most cases people try to do the best for their kids but for him i don't know it might be a little laziness or something or i don't know kathy what about you honestly i don't think i thought that deeply when i was young at that time but looking back now i can see why they were like that i was a first child they had no experience they had me kind of young like looking at other people have children early i'm just like i can't do that i don't have time i just don't know how to raise a kid so yeah when i was young i wouldn't know so i didn't question myself like that i i i'm noticing that y'all are sort of almost answering the question from like a developmental psychology sort of way where we're focusing on parenting as to why they were the way they were but i'm more thinking like on a more existential level do you all ever wonder about why your life is the way it is there was a big bang and then cosmic dust and then we crawled out of the soup and all that stuff but yeah yeah what yeah okay so i'm noticing that the question is hard to tackle which is exactly why we're talking about it so let's start with a little bit of science so people are kind of wondering like okay what's the meaning of life right and so i don't know if you all follow a particular religious tradition so i have two major biases that i'll sort of share right now when it comes to how i'm gonna approach this the first bias is a scientific one so there's actually like research that we're about to go into about like meaning and how human beings the role of meaning and purpose and crap like that in people's life and like how you find meaning because the cool thing is scientifically we actually kind of have answers around this the second thing is going to be that i i come i was raised sort of in the hindu tradition but that really didn't mean much to me and then i spent a couple years studying to become a monk and i found the stuff that i learned that's basically sort of a perspective from the karmic religions so the karmic religions i'm referring to basically hinduism and buddhism in their various offshoots they have some interesting perspectives around karma and things like that which if you all want to learn about that and even some of the things that i kind of teach in terms of the correlation between expectation and suffering those that kind of thought originated from that tradition although you could make strong arguments that it was independently discovered elsewhere so stoicism for example in greece and things like that that these are things that people have like discovered in multiple places so let's talk about science so when you take someone with trauma okay so i don't know if that applies to anyone here but when you take someone who's gone through a traumatic experience there's actually some really interesting data that people who are able to make meaning out of that experience are the ones who do better so there's research on this there's a cool kind of budding field of psychiatry and psychology called post traumatic growth so everyone has heard of ptsd we all know that people will go through particularly traumatic experiences but the really interesting thing is not everyone who goes through a traumatic experience winds up with ptsd some of them actually like wind up oddly like stronger better more confident themselves and that's the research into something called post-traumatic growth and what we've essentially discovered from post-traumatic growth is that when i have a sense of identity something happens to me and it shakes my sense of identity so for example if you look at abuse towards young children so there's some really interesting research here where as a young child i have impaired theory of mind and what theory of mind is is this the acknowledgment that other people exist so when i'm like six months old i don't understand that there are other human beings that exist that have independent thoughts and feelings and actions and stuff like that so that's what makes uh trauma so devastating towards kids is because if i don't think anyone else exists and something bad happens to me who's responsible the child feels absolutely and that's evolutionary because if i'm learning how to walk and i stumble and fall like i need to be responsible for that right so a lot of things like basic early on i can't be blaming my parents for like not learning how to walk at the age of nine months otherwise i'll never learn how to walk 12 months really is when we learn how to walk so there's this kind of impaired theory of mind which which sort of makes trauma towards children so devastating because in their mind they're the only ones that really kind of exist so they accept more and more responsibility so we sort of here here i am i have a sense of identity trauma happens shakes that sense of identity and then if i am able to develop a good narrative around that if i'm able to find meaning in my traumatic experience then i will grow from it and i will be less likely to be like have ptsd or some kind of psychiatric diagnosis and this this research comes out of like you know conditions where like genocide or stuff like that where you have massive groups of people who have a shared traumatic experience and so you've got refugee camps where not everyone develops ptsd and then researchers will go in and they'll try to figure out like why doesn't one person have ptsd why does another person have it so this is why it's really important to find meaning there's also evidence from psychotherapy that if you want to help people you need some kind of explanatory system so this is where some people may be asking is there some meaning to life and the short answer is scientifically it doesn't matter it doesn't matter that your meaning is correct what matters is that it's internally consistent and relatively comprehensive so you have to derive some sense of meaning that can explain the range of things and that you can continuously apply does that make sense so for example if i'm a psychoanalyst and i love sigmund freud and i'm all into sigmund freud's various theories about edible complexes and anal phase and phallic phase and oral phase and all that kind of stuff that's actually totally fine it's not whether it's like scientifically correct or not as long as my system is consistent and can apply to things and people can kind of buy into it it'll actually be therapeutic this is why we have so many different perspectives on psychotherapy and they all basically work the same even though the core belief structures are quite different so when it comes to finding meaning what we need to do is figure out okay how am i gonna formulate meaning so i personally for example i put a lot of stock in the theory of karma when i work with patients i lean into that sort of internally and then i'll try to figure out whether they're open to that crap if they're open to that crap then i'll talk about it if they're not open to that crap that's actually totally fine i don't have to impose my beliefs on them but in terms of my mind the reason that i put stock in the theory of karma is it's kind of scientific for me it's that all causes have effects and all effects have causes right like that's like to me a scientific principle that gravity is cause and effect physics is cause and effect chemistry grows out of physics that has cause and effect biochemistry grows out of chemistry that has cause and effect biology grows out of biochemistry uh cell biology grows out of biology cell biology becomes neurobiology neuro biology becomes neuroscience neuroscience becomes psychology psychology becomes human behavior becomes economics becomes advertising and we know that we can have scientific principles we can deduce equations of economics psychology advertising behavior so cause and effect kind of happens and then the question is does it end at some point so to me scientifically this is a question that you all have to answer to me it doesn't make sense that there's an arbitrary endpoint and in fact if you look at the history of scientific progression essentially like we've been able to better explain causes and effects and now they're even sort of scientific equations for economics right so we can sort of try to deduce things mathematically to like interest rates and like raising interest rates and lowering interest rates and we have all these kind of principles so the key thing for y'all is going to be to think a little bit about you know why does stuff happen to you and i encourage you all to think about this because until you have an answer to that question it can feel like you're rudderless so this is the other sort of scientific finding is it's not that a particular god exists or that the theory of karma is correct or anything like that i mean that may be true but that's like a point of religious debate we're not really concerned with that what we do know is that from a scientific sense if you're trying to figure out what the hell is going on in your life you need some kind of internally consistent and comprehensive like metaphysical system so for some people that's a particular religion nice thing about religion is they package it up for you and it's kind of like a you know you just get the whole thing and it's all set there are various downsides to religion some people sort of espouse kind of a more spiritual perspective or whatever i think it's just important to think a little bit about why stuff happens to you the really cool thing about once you start to explore meaning in your life is that like it helps you through stuff so remember we started talking about about post-traumatic growth and ptsd and the key thing is as [ __ ] happens in your life if you have some kind of internal system to make sense of it then it'll be easy to make sense of it and as we start making sense of things we can start like navigating life right so what is the source of suffering well remember we talked about expectation but what is it the root of it why do we emotionally why do we sort of vent our emotions what does that allow us to do y'all remember okay so i mean we we we we uh we talked about i i could be wrong here we talked about expectations like being the source of anxiety yeah so even deeper than that avidya or ignorance is the source of suffering and so remember that like when y'all didn't understand how crap worked like generally speaking you get screwed right and once you start to understand the mechanics of a video game for example then you can start to perform better you start to understand it more you know how to improve etc so and this is where like i know it sounds kind of weird but if ignorance is the source of suffering and y'all don't have to accept that it's just a hypothesis then the question kind of becomes like do you understand what's happening in your life and as we start to like explore that like why is this happening and i'm talking on a global level and i recognize that i've worked with a lot of people who you know their upbringing has taught them that asking why is a useless question i don't care about the why all that matters you need to get an a plus the why is an irrelevant question i don't care why i don't care what you want i don't care about meaning you need to play the violin you need to get an a plus you need to go to state championship you need to do this you need to become doctor like it the whys are completely irrelevant like you have to hit the like it's all about the destination not the truth it's all about the metrics and the results and so this is the thing early on we talked about getting away from results and tapping into our authentic self the problem is that if we've been conditioned to focus on results we need some kind of compass we can't just ignore all the results and then like magically [ __ ] starts happening right that's why it's so hard to get away from results because you need some other kind of compass and what is that compass it's the meaning and i recognize that for some of you this is going to be really foreign but i don't know how else to say this like so ash shared with us that she apparently if i heard correctly you know she like found her grandmother who had passed away and so sometimes when something bad happens to us we have this question why me why did i have to be the person and then this is where like i don't know how to say this but people say like oh there's no answer there's no real answer but that's so damn unsatisfying then she has to walk around with the question imagine for a moment that you actually had an answer someone was like hey this is why it happened this is why it had to be you this is what it's done to you this is what it's going to turn you into and for zell like sure he was a chad 7th grader doing like 15 things but like look at the legacy that it's left him and like metric here is tossing out his abusive father which is the climax of a tv show that is a feel-good moment for everyone who's watching when it's fictionalized and romanticized but it's done a number on him right and kathy here is beating herself up because she didn't get her [ __ ] together and she has so many opportunities and she can't take advantage of them and so this is where like we're kind of moving into how do you think about yourself but this i don't know how else to say this but if you wanna if you need like what we need what y'all need what we all need is a compass like what am i doing with content creation kathy's like i've only streamed two or three days like are you upset about that is that okay and i'm sort of getting from kathy that she doesn't know should she be doing more should she be doing less is it okay is it not okay how the hell do you answer that and so in the vacuum of this internal compass we fill it up with metrics view counts we fill it up with all the analytics that the world gives us we fill it up with how much money we earn we fill it up with the degree that's on our wall we fill it up with trophies and all this other crap right because like if i have nothing to navigate i might as well go for an a plus because that's where things get measured but if we want to get away from that we have to think about our own internal compass so what i would want is for kathy to be able to answer for herself and be content with is it okay to stream only two or three days kathy is it okay to stream only two or three days yes do you really believe that yes okay great done yeah right so so and this is where like we gotta we gotta figure out you know like how are we gonna make decisions especially for people like zell here is thinking about getting a full-time job kathy has a full-time job we can talk about those kinds of things but as we have all of these discussions where ash is trying to figure out how to spend her time metrics trying to figure out what he should stream all you all are trying to figure out do i expand do i grow do i lean into my authenticity or do i play by the metrics like how do we incorporate certain analytics versus being true to ourselves we need an internal compass and once you find that internal compass it makes all of your decision making easier and if you look at like in the past when people were religious we kind of outsourced that stuff to god we're like god says do this we're gonna follow that that's what i'm gonna make my decisions based on and what we sort of know is people who can do that kind of mentally as we've looked at the science of that kind of thinking we found that basically like it doesn't matter which god you choose or whatever right so i'm sure that people who are religious will have issues with that i'm kind of talking about science here is that you just need some kind of system questions does that answer y'all's question i know we're going to talk more about this but does that at least answer your question when ash was saying like let's talk about meaning and why like what direction we're going to go in that that clears a lot of things up i think okay in terms of the meaning of meaning yeah but i'm yeah i mean i think that makes sense and like i was just kind of thinking again just like trying to answer that question for myself but like finding that internal compass feels really vague and existential and my like when i'm trying to reason myself with like why things happen like my brain keeps just like hitting a brick wall with like yeah yeah because because and this is this is i mean not trying to generalize here but you know we've got kathy you're korean yes got two koreans who have a shared experience around this thing i'm sure that other people it's not exclusive to korean people but like some cultures just don't care about why why is like not an important thing and so it feels like vague what i'm saying is that from a scientific perspective getting a clear sense of why is like very very like healthy in terms of giving us so now the question is how the hell do we do that answer is i don't really know but we're going to try to figure out because like i said this was not part of the original curriculum so i'm going to do my best but so we'll we'll figure something out so damn it you're supposed to fix everything well i'm not going to fix it y'all will figure it out you guys are like kathy's already fixed it right she's she's solid so here's here's what i would start with so i want you all for homework i want y'all to write one page and better if you really do write it out bonus points if you handwrite it out and i'll explain why write one page about how you feel about yourself so when you do this exercise you can do a separate exercise actually yeah so we're gonna make it complicated you can sort of ignore this part but as so i want you to take two pieces of paper and on one page i want you to write how you think about yourself then what i want you to do is as you're doing exercise number one you're going to have thoughts about things that you don't want to put on page number one so you're gonna get some kind of reflexive answer like oh like i'm kinda sus but you're like i don't want to write that and i want you to put that on on page number two okay if that doesn't work for you that's okay you can just write one page about how you think about yourself you don't have to do the second part but i just what i'm trying to clue you all in on is that as you do this exercise you're going to notice and hopefully you all are trained in this at this point that you're going to have reflexive reactions metrics like am i bringing down the mood magic no talking about being physically violent and throwing your dad out on the street no man that's totally fine right like that's you know you're gonna have these reactions and you're gonna have politeness with yourself ash is going to be like oh no i don't want to let myself wallow in the negativity which is totally fine ash we don't want you to wallow in the negativity which we want you to bring it here let that [ __ ] out you don't have to hand you don't have to carry it by yourself i think that's what i struggle with yeah right so it's gonna be absolutely our responsibility to bring it out of you okay so you're gonna keep apologizing and then right now people are telling you don't be sorry everyone's doing a good job of saying how much they appreciate it and then at some point they're gonna say you know what i did want to actually share something you took my spotlight and that's perfectly okay one day maybe we'll get there i don't know if this group will ever get there it's okay we don't have to no expectations not i was gonna say not just that challenge like yeah when you explained the homework i was laughing to myself because i've just been internally doing that this whole session there's almost like a um a separate like there's things i really want to say and i know with my adhd they're like they're there and then they're gone and then there's like these separate like bubbles of thoughts that i'm like can't say that can't say that can't say that out loud either like i've literally the homework is like my constant thought process yeah so maybe it'll be easy for you then we'll see i'll forget by then it's okay so so whatever and i i think once again the homework isn't about you know complete it's not about a grade it's to really get you all to start thinking about this and i think what we really need to dig into before we get to meaning is we have to understand like who are you how do you feel about yourself right and and that kind of vague stuff and so here are the reasons to write it so when i ask that question based on our conditioning your mind will produce a reflexive response okay so if i ask ash ash how do you feel about yourself ash is going to be like i love myself a lot which is true and incomplete so the reason that we write one page is the first half is gonna be what you reflexively believe and that's totally fine it's all good it's good that you love yourself and i'm kinda sus right and by the time you get to the end of the bottom of the first page there's going to be stuff there that you'll have uncovered okay the other reason to write as opposed to type is generally speaking if you write it'll be slower than typing and that that way your mind will be working on it for a longer period of time and you will uncover more stuff and so next week what i'm gonna try to do i don't know i'm gonna have to think about the existential stuff because i don't know like i can't i mean i can teach you all you know a method that works for me but i think we have to learn a little bit more about who we are before we develop an internal compass because i think we've already learned that so far so here's what i think we've taken away so far is that y'all are operating based on a compass for sure but it's not necessarily a compass that you picked it was the compass that was given to you and in order to find our own compass we've got to figure out who we are and point of clarity does it have to be exclusive to the who we are as a content creator or can it be just general yeah so here's and here no i can i should absolutely be be general or i mean you can talk about contemplation but here's the here's the hypothesis here and this is something that is less scientifically valid but i feel you know you just haven't done a ton of research on it that when you align who who you are with content creation that's when you become the best content creator that's a hypothesis we have i don't know that that's factually correct sounds pretty authentic right so that's where we don't want to think about ourselves as content creators first we want to think about ourselves as human beings and then we'll translate that once we take that authenticity and then we apply analytics to it then we start playing the game of content creation that's when we actually succeed we don't want to ignore the analytics but we don't want the analytics to be our compass does that make sense we want analytics to like if i've got five natural impulses i'm gonna let the analytics let me be calculating on which one of those to invest in if that sort of makes sense so we still want to use the analytics and there's overwhelming evidence that content creators who pay attention to analytics outperform those who don't but we don't want them to substitute for an internal compass okay because the internal compass is essentially a substitute for the compass that we already have which centers around things like analytics and metrics potentially so here's what can happen the first is that our internal our our compass can be conditionally given to us by our parents right so like metric for example is waiting for people to crap on him why it's because i mean we don't know this for sure but you know i'm sure it has i would be very surprised if it had nothing to do with the fact that his dad was violent when he was growing up and stuff like that right it's because metric grew up in a situation where he learned that no matter what i do someone is there to crap on me okay so maybe that's not the case we don't really know we haven't really dug into it yet but so sometimes our conditioning gives us a sense of like a compass of what we should or shouldn't do does that make sense second thing is that when we don't have when we're not centered within ourselves we become more responsive to signals from the external world does that make sense so when i don't know who i am as a content creator and i'm looking for a direction i have things like view counts and sub counts and this person blew up here and this is on lsf and this is going on and everyone's playing this game and i'm going to use that as a substitute for an internal compass we even see this in cases of personality disorders where when when there are certain personality disorders where i don't have a good sense of who i am so who i am is determined by how other people treat me so if i'm treated well i'm a good person if i'm treated well i'm a bad person and there's no sense of independent identity this actually happens to content creators because we get so much analytical feedback that we start to value ourselves based on analytics so who i am and my value as a human being starts to correlate more tightly with my value the value of the content that i create does that make sense those get those two things get tangled up so what we if you want to be a healthy and arguably somewhat successful content creator because there may be some evidence that the most successful content creators are completely into the analytic side but they suffer immensely i don't think that's the case but we don't really have a good sample size when you're talking about very very successful content creators does that make sense so we can use external data as a substitute when we don't know who we are we oftentimes will make decisions based on how we would condition to make decisions summary points one and two in order to find peace and direction in life we need some kind of existential approach that is both comprehensive and consistent when we apply that approach to our lives we will be able to find a sense of direction and purpose as we find a sense of direction and purpose we feel better about ourselves as we feel better about ourselves we become more resilient to external data and aren't influenced by it and hopefully then we can incorporate it in a healthy way and create the best content questions okay i have a question but it's semi-unrelated it's more about just like discussion format just because you kind of touched on this earlier but like when people say stuff and you have like you know those thought bubbles that are like kind of like what ruby mentioned where like i shouldn't say this like i mean it sounded like we should say these things as like a part of our authentic self but like also from a respectful slash polite point of view i'm kind of like i don't want to say the wrong thing especially when people are being emotionally vulnerable and so for me like i i'm just kind of curious like you know how we handle that great question um so two things one is we're just gonna have to find what feels right for the group okay so i encourage you all to say something and then we're going to check in with the group one thing i feel pretty good about is i'm pretty sure that people here understand that the intentions of everyone else is positive so until y'all start taking risks i'm gonna have to keep taking risks right so like yeah and then if i do that too much y'all are gonna start to dislike me so that's something so you all need to start taking i mean stop okay so and the second thing is i i remind y'all to remember what our three values are compassion authenticity and presence so we always want compassion to come first so if you're gonna say something it's i think it's okay to challenge someone else it's not okay to intentionally hurt someone else if i authentically believe that you are a terrible human being i don't want to say that because compassion trumps authenticity at the same time i think that y'all do a good job of like engaging with each other and i i don't know like holding hands and singing kumbaya i do not think is going to help you all that much what's going on i mean we can do it anyway but uh i'm not saying it's so that has but but what i want y'all to be able to do is to like get into the negative and then acknowledge that it's okay right like so you're not perfect i don't i don't want you all to strive to help each other to meet perfection i want you all my goal is to help you all be okay not being perfect and then to still move forward we're not saying because that sometimes people think that means apathy we want you to move towards your goals but move towards your goals not to attain perfection but because you want to do this you want to make the world a better place you want to create content that you share with people so that should be the goal and that's once again a bias that i have does that answer your question zl yeah okay all righty thank you very much anyone streaming uh i am okay um okay so we'll we'll toss your right metric okay thank you all right take care everyone thank you for coming thank you thanks dr k thank you everyone bye bye okay all right make sense we're streaming tomorrow chat um questions before we raid metric people understand what we're kind of saying here you know so i think this is like important to understand that so we could do like a lecture about some of these concepts but the key thing about group work is that it gives us a opportunity to apply stuff does that make sense like it's not enough to say like i can share that scientific stuff but like now the real work happens and you can take a concept like you can read 300 pages about finding meaning in your life but we sort of know i mean there isn't great research on this but there's like a fair amount of research that just reading books or information does not lead to behavioral change behavioral change comes from the application of information or the development of understanding and so if you really want to make a change in your life you have to do internal exploration and hopefully some kind of facilitation so like a lot of people will do the internal exploration and they'll get there eventually but this is the key thing we also know that if you have some kind of facilitator support or expert they can increase the speed at which you make progress does that make sense so it's like you have to do internal work but like with a guide of some kind and the guide isn't going to have the answer for you right so i can't show up at group and say okay this is what you need this is what you need this is what you need this is what you need and this is the problem with like generally speaking things like self-help videos or advice or whatever is that it's not personalized so like today we learned all kinds of stuff that we had no idea about right so like when metric beats himself up like where does that come from well like we learned some interesting information when kathy is feeling tired all the time like where does that come from well we unders we learned some interesting information and it's the lack of personal application that gets to just dot dot dot if that makes sense right just get out more just go to the gym just to grieve and move on well why why is it hard to do those things because there's a personal component so you can you can understand grief but in order to apply it to your individual level there needs to be a translation you
