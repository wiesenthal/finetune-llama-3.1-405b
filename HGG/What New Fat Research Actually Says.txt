the first thing that we're going to talk about today is fat and mainly the role of fat within the body and in order to talk about this we're going to have to embark on a couple of like basic physiologic kind of things okay so we're going to explain a couple of systems and basic physiologic concepts with the body so the reason that i personally got interested in this is because a lot of times when it comes to helping people like even when i think about my patients i've been astonished by how much exercise or weight loss can help improve people's mood and like overall well-being so we know that the body and mind are like very very closely connected right so there's a mind-body connection the interesting thing that i'm excited about more recently is that this mind-body connection has been historically sort of like propagated by people like people who are into yoga or tai chi or you know meditation and that's totally fine there's nothing wrong with any of those things we're big believers in the value of yoga tai chi meditation because there's been science about that and that's that's what actually gets me pretty excited is that there have been lots of clinical trials now on on yoga for example um to re uh reduce the effects of osteoarthritis or rheumatoid arthritis um tai chi and osteoarthritis there are a lot of inflammatory conditions that can get positively affected by these sorts of things as well as like mental health conditions so we know that for example like doing yoga and meditation and stuff like that can have positive effects on mood and even clinically reduced symptoms of things like generalized anxiety disorder major depressive disorder so we know that there's a mind-body connection so now what i'm super excited about is like as science progresses what we're sort of discovering is like what is specifically the nature of the mind-body connection so what is happening in our body and what are like the chemical compounds hormones paracrine autocrine factors so those are different things in the hormonal system which we'll explain in a second that sort of relate to and affect our mind and other parts of our physiology and one of the biggest discoveries over the last i want to say decade but maybe even closer to 15 years because remember all science moves slow right so this hasn't really even in a sense hit the mainstream yet even though there's been like 10 or 15 years of research on it um is that fat is not energy storage so there's been a perception that we have these things called adipocytes and that adipocytes are fat storage cells and we've sort of believed that basically as you you know eat for example more carbohydrates so carbohydrates really stimulate adipocytes um and as our fat cells is we make more fat cells and our as our fat cells grow and fill up with fat we've sort of assumed physio physiologically that like that that's what they are it's just like your fat is just kind of sitting there right so your your belly fat other parts of your fat are just like they're just storage and so as we exercise more as we eat healthier as we start to enter a negative caloric state that like we start to burn more calories than we use and so that's then we get rid of the fat so it's just storage it's kind of we're filling up our vaults with fat and energy and as we start you know stop making deposits and start making withdrawals we like burn out that fat but the really interesting thing recently is that adipocytes are actually very endocrinologically active and what does that mean so in terms of our body we have something called the endocrine system so the endocrine system is the system of hormones generally speaking and what is a hormone so a hormone is a chemical compound that travels through the bloodstream and affects distant organs right so if we think about our adrenal glands which are sort of situated like right here like kind of in the back they sit above our kidneys our adrenal glands will secrete adrenaline right so if we get like some kind of let's say there's a uh we're driving down the street and someone like swerves in front of us we'll get a burst of adrenaline so that's a chemical compound that's released from here travels through our bloodstream and starts to have all kinds of different effects so i think of hormones is essentially like body wide signals it's almost like stances in like gaming so there's like tank stance there's dps stance there's going into stealth so it's sort of like a kind of a body wide like let's get all of our organ systems in line let's get our skeletal muscle our heart rate our digestive system our brain all kind of focused in the same direction so a good example of this is that adrenaline will increase our heart rate will increase our blood pressure will reduce blood flow to our digestive system because when adrenaline is active we don't need to be metabolizing nutrients like we're not worried about like digesting things and you know storing things away for later we're worried about survival so it'll constrict blood vessels to our stomach and our intestines and our colon and it'll dilate blood vessels to our skeletal muscles to our arms and legs so what we're basically doing is rerouting blood blood flow from our gi system to our muscles other examples of adrenaline they also affect your brain so when adrenaline is in the brain we start to make we start to see the world as more black and white and we start to see like more danger in things and we tend to start to make like very very like rapid decisions right because when we're if we're being attacked by a tiger for example like we don't want to sit there and like think philosophically about whether you know whether the tiger is friendly or hungry or what like we we need to act so hormones act body wide so the interesting thing here is that they're like we understand a lot of you know hormonal actions and stuff there's thyroid hormone adrenaline insulin glucagon all that kind of good stuff we understand how these things work but one of the most interesting recent discoveries and once again recent is like 10 to 15 years is that adipocytes are endocrinologically active and so what that means is they secrete all kinds of stuff that has different kinds of effects on different parts of our body so rather than being like inert what this sort of means is that a lot of what people may experience if they are overweight or they do have central adiposity so there's even data that shows that central adiposity is worse than peripheral adiposity and what does this mean so basically like when the majority of your fat or if you have more fat that's around your belly that tissue seems to act differently not all adipocytes are the same then fat that let's let's say is around your thighs or your arms or your back or whatever so it's kind of interesting because not all adipocytes because remember that fat is sort of distributed throughout your body like we'll have sort of belly fat we'll have visceral fat which is the fat that surrounds our organs we'll have peripheral fat we'll have some fat like around our thighs and things like that and it seems that central adiposity is like worse for health outcomes than peripheral adiposity so i'm a little bit rusty on this stuff but for example i think central adiposity has worse cardiovascular outcomes so if you have this you know two people with the same grams of fat on their body the person who has all of their fat sort of located around their belly region is more likely to have worse cardiovascular outcomes which includes things like heart attacks than people who have fat that's like evenly distributed through their body and so that sort of suggests that not all adipocytes are the same which in turn sort of uh and as people started to explore that what they sort of discovered is that adipocytes are endocrinologically active so let's take a quick look at some of the measures of what fat actually does okay so i'm gonna go to a quick review article but this is um white fat so if we look uh let me see if there's a better diagram here yeah here we go this is gonna be easier to understand so this is if we look at white fat so what people have sort of discovered is that there is there are all kinds of effects from white fat so we're going to kind of zero in on a couple so the first that we're going to talk about is appetite regulation and nutritional intake so what this sort of means is that the amount of fat you have will actually affect things like how hungry you feel okay the second thing that we're going to talk a little bit about is insulin so glucose and lipid metabolism this is really really important um so for example like diabetes so one of the the things that has been shown to clinically improve diabetes and insulin resistance and healthier blood sugar metabolism is actually losing weight so this is another example of something that's kind of like not really a clinical treatment right so exercise is not a clinical treatment like it's not a medicine that's prescribed but is part of something that you can do to clinically improve a illness so glucose and lipid metabolism are affected body weight homeostasis is affected by the amount of fat you have but there's also all kinds of stuff that we didn't sort of realize one is vascular tone control this means blood pressure um it affects our coagulation cascade and uh fibrino lysis so what this sort of means is like clotting so the the risk factors of stroke or developing a deep vein thrombosis um having things like a pulmonary embolism like these are all things where coagulation sort of affects our ability to for example coagulate if we get a cut but it also does things like if if we're too pro coagulant what that means is that we can develop a blockage within our blood blood vessels and a stroke is essentially like let me just explain this so why is coagulation important so if you're in a pro coagulatory state i've got a blood vessel that's going to my brain and if my coagulation proteins are all messed up what they're going to do is they're going to coagulate and they're gonna stop blood flow and then once i stop blood flow what this means is that like the brain over here is like not receiving blood and then i end up with something called an ischemic stroke okay so remember that coagulation proteins are there to stop blood flow so if i get a cut on my arm it starts to bleed and then my coagulation proteins like show up and then they'll like block the the cut and then they'll you know then you'll scab over and then you get that little like blood scab right which is hard in his blood and it's not really skin you can pick it off and it'll start bleeding again so that's the coagulation process the really interesting thing here is that it seems like coagulation balance is actually affected by like the amount of fat that you have other really important things are just in general immunity um angiogenesis reproduction so what this sort of means is that so for example we also know that sometimes if people have difficulty getting pregnant that um affecting their body weight can actually like increase their chances of pregnancy and there are even some medications that you can take if you are overweight and trying to get pregnant that will help you sort of get pregnant and some of those medications will do things like glu affect glucose and lipid metabolism are also used as treatments for diabetes so the key thing here is that fat affects like all kinds of different things in your body and the reason that i think this is important for like our community is because i've sort of seen this as a mental health professional where like sometimes fixing a clinical issue or improving a clinical issue can involve like non-clinical things so there are you know all kinds of patients that i've worked with who will start exercising for example and what we see is that like their their experience of of a depressive episode gets like substantially better and so we know some of these mechanisms pretty well so for example like we know that sunlight has a protective mechanism against depression um and part of part of the reason for that is because vitamin d deficiency is a risk factor for major depressive disorder so when when i see a patient oftentimes what i'll do is i'll order a vitamin d test and if their level is low then what we'll do is supplement vitamin d or i'll tell them to get into the sun more and it's really interesting because it seems to help there's data that shows that vitamin d supplementation can actually improve clinical depression so the point about fat is that like this is the kind of thing where if you start exercising and you reduce your your the amount of white fat that you have that you may have benefits in all kinds of different parts of your life that you're not really aware of right it could help you potentially get pregnant it could help you with appetite regulation it could help you with autoimmune diseases so we're not really sure there's like different clinical trials depending on what you're talking to and that's why you should absolutely like if you're concerned about this and you do have a medical condition bring it up with your doctor and sort of get their guidance so let's dive into what some of these things are and why i think they're important okay so the first thing is nutritional intake there are two things that we're going to talk about two things that two hormones or chemical signals that adipocytes produce the first is leptin so this gives us a sense of satiety so we tend to have two hormones that will make us feel hungry or make us feel full the really interesting thing is that generally speaking leptin is what makes us feel full and ghrelin is what makes us feel hungry but it appears that something happens when you have sort of dysregulated adipocyte metabolism that causes leptin to be released and can sometimes have paradoxical effects so something about the amount of fat that you have and we'll kind of get into other mechanisms seems to affect how hungry you feel and if the body was simple it would be as simple as oh leptin makes you feel full fat produces leptin therefore fat should make you feel full but the body is complicated right we have dozens and dozens or hundreds of signals having different effects on different organs and what we sort of find is that leptin metabolism seems to be messed up and can actually like affect people's sense of satiety and how hungry they feel what precise effect does it have we actually don't know because it's complicated and we haven't entirely figured it out yet the second uh hormone i want to talk about is angiotensin so angiotensin also affects um [Music] essentially like our salt intake so it's a hormone that will really really affect how much you crave salt angiotensin is also very important for blood pressure because our blood pressure is maintained heavily by our you know the sodium concentration of our blood and so for example if someone has high blood pressure we'll give them a medication or we can give them a medication called an arb which is an angiotensin receptor blocker so what happens is when you block the action of angiotensin it reduces your blood pressure so the other thing here that's important is that it affects um salt intake right and also like we know that for example reducing weight can have beneficial effects on blood pressure blood pressure uh being having high blood pressure is one of the slowest and most dangerous diseases you can have part of the reason it's so dangerous is because you'll never feel it so our body is very very good at if we have a blood pressure of 120 over 80 we'll feel potentially exactly the same as if we're 160 over 100. the problem is if you sit at 160 over 100 for many many many years it can do a lot of damage to your your different organs like kidneys brain etc and since our body is so good at adapting to blood pressure you won't sort of feel it so one of the trickiest things about being a doctor is getting like patients to take their blood pressure medication because if they skip five days they don't feel a difference but if they do take it they'll sort of experience potentially side effects so sometimes it can be really hard for patients to like take blood pressure medication because you don't see a benefit right it's not like taking um like an anti-inflammatory or antipyretic medication like ibuprofen or acetaminophen when you have a fever it's like you feel instantly better it's not like taking anti-nausea medication it's like you you know you don't feel it key thing here is that it seems like uh fat cells will actually secrete leptin and angiotensin so we're sort of discovering is that like fat cells will are endocrinologically active and will affect like blood pressure in your kidneys so the next thing that we're going to talk a little bit about is insulin sensitivity so just to give you all a little bit of background when we have blood when we eat a candy bar and we have glucose in our bloodstream this travels to our pancreas our pancreas detects it and secretes insulin specifically from the beta cells of the pancreas insulin then goes to different cells and tells them hey we've got a bunch of sugar in our blood take those take that sugar in and stick it in your cell and so then that ends up reducing the concentration of sugar in our blood so this is basically how our body signals insulin is the signal to our body that we just ate a meal so what happens when we eat a meal we digest it in our stomach we absorb it in our intestines it gets absorbed into our bloodstream insulin gets triggered and then all of that nutrients all those nutrients will get absorbed by our cells so they get taken up by our brain they get taken up by liver they get taken up by skeletal muscle and they get taken up by adipocytes so one of the things that we've sort of discovered is that adipocytes lead to insulin resistance and what does that mean what does that do so this sort of makes sense physiologically right if you want to think about this from a bird's eye view remember everything that we're talking about is somewhat of an oversimplification but the more fat storage you have the less likely to make fat because this is what happens over here you you need to be so our body has something called a a weight set point so a set point for how much we want to weigh and it's kind of tightly regulated around that set point and so this is the kind of thing where like if we have a bunch of fat like it's sort of telling our body hey we don't need to store more fat that's sort of like the general like physiologic logic behind it physiologic logic you guys like that so the tricky thing here is that even though adipocytes cause insulin resistance like isn't that a good thing well not really because when we have a bunch of blood sugar floating around in our bloodstream and it doesn't get absorbed this is how we end up with diabetes and the reason that diabetes is bad is because it turns out that having high concentrations of blood sugar in your bloodstream is damaging to your cells so for example when we have high blood sugar for prolonged periods of time we're talking like years or decades right for like 10 years what that does is cause peripheral nerve damage for example worsens cardiovascular outcomes okay so what this sort of means is that our bloodstream is not designed to have a bunch of blood sugar there and so like it's supposed to like blood sugar is supposed to be like relatively transient and or it keeps at a certain level so it's tightly regulated if it's way higher than that it starts to cause like damage to our cells you can sort of think of it like a sewer pipe that gets clogged with stuff right like this the sewer pipe is supposed to be like free-flowing and it's supposed to transport stuff right like we want it to be like moving particular things and move from point a to point b but we don't want to like clog up our sewer pipe even with the stuff that it's supposed to carry and that can lead to bad outcomes so the other thing about adipocytes is that they tend to lead to insulin resistance worsen our blood sugar and can contribute to things like diabetes these functions are basically like people sort of get right we know that fat has something to do with nutritional intake insulin sensitivity metabolism etc so this is what gets to be really really interesting inflammatory markers so fat appears to be a pro in i shouldn't say pro high levels of fat can lead to a pro inflammatory state so two markers we're going to talk about tnf alpha and interleukin 6. so tnf alpha and interleukin-6 are two cytokines so these are like uh immunological signals so in our bloodstream we have like white blood cells okay we also have things like macrophages which eat other cells i mean they they eat things like bacteria and they're flowing around in our bloodstream when we have high levels of tnf alpha and interleukin-6 both of these guys go into high alert so like oh this means that there's like let's let's attack something it's like go time and what happens when we enter a high inflammatory state which can be healthy right there's a reason why we create inflammation inflammation can be part of the process of healing can also be part of the process that we use to fight an infection so when you get like let's say i get a cut that gets infected it gets warm and and inflamed and hurts and why is that it's because there's vasodilation so our capillaries are kind of like leaking stuff and what they're leaking is is like white blood cells so they're leaking like immune system stuff and then all of our white blood cells are going to the site of battle in conducting a war against the bacteria that are that are building there so that inflammation can be a healthy part of our body the challenge is that when we have a bunch of uh adipocytes that are kind of like not regulated properly they can increase the level of tnf alpha in interleukin-6 and this in turn will lead to pro-inflammatory states and the problem with pro-inflammatory states is that a lot of the the problems that we face medically are like diseases of inflammation so there are even inflammatory hypotheses for clinical depression those seem to be like not great to be honest so people have even done clinical trials where can you tr treat a depressive episode with anti-inflammatory agents and the answer is like it doesn't seem like there's great evidence for that but we do know that there's low levels of inflammation in the brain when people are clinically depressed so you know question mark for clinical depression but then there are all kinds of other diseases that people suffer from right so like arthritis eczema ibs which is inflammatory bowel syndrome um all sorts of autoimmune diseases so like things like lupus right so if you all watch house like the lupus is always on the differential so all kinds of conditions like psoriasis is another one so like skin conditions like different kinds of inflammation like gastric inflammation gastritis like all this stuff gets worse by like you know all these pro-inflammatory cytokines and remember that like the pro-inflammatory cytokines aren't by themselves bad right it's just that our body wants them to be active at a particular time and wants them to be like not active at other times a couple of other things to remember is that i think alpha and il-6 are the strongest predictors in terms of cytokines that is of covid mortality right so this is just like a simple example of how we've looked at okay if people are more likely to die of covid what's going on in their immune system and it seems like they're dumping high levels of tnf alpha and il-6 the other reason that this is important is not just because of autoimmune stuff but il-6 has been linked to aging so this is another example of like data that is very preliminary so we don't know necessarily that like aisle 6 makes you older but if we look at the processes of cellular aging and we look at the effects of il-6 on those processes what we find is that they tend to accelerate those processes so there may be some links that having and there's also some you know epidemiological evidence that for example like having a low inflammatory state leads to longer lifespan so this is one of those situations where you have to be really careful about connecting the dots this does not necessarily mean that having a bunch of adipocytes will mean you age faster right so i don't want you all to draw that conclusion this is how science works where like what some like you know we know this piece which is that aisle six accelerates um you know certain cellular processes let's just call this process a the other thing that we know is we'll look at aging and what we find is oh aging also seems to be mediated by process a so what this sort of what some people will want to do is they'll say oh that means that aisle six definitively causes you to get older faster which i don't think is fair to say we haven't really linked those but it seems that i mean we haven't sort of made that conclusion but it does seem that there's some linkage another good example of this is that you know we look at cancer which essentially ages our cells very rapidly and il-6 is sort of correlated with that rapid aging within cancer also our immune system is all over the place when we have cancer so this is where once again like just to be aware that there's all kinds of effects that adipocytes could be having on your body including potentially accelerating the aging process which is actually like kind of scary right that's why we're sort of sharing it with you okay so there are a couple of other things that we've sort of already talked about but i'll just kind of mention so pai-1 is a plasminogen activating something so this is like the clotting stuff fibrinolysis so fibrin is essentially something that can form like a a clot and so what we want to do is break down the clot right so over time what we we don't want to we don't have a clot forever so when i get a cut i want it to clot over and then i want to build skin underneath and then we want to break down essentially like the dam which is what a fibrin clot is it's a dam that prevents flow and then like then we want to break it down because we want flow to go back there right so on my hand eventually i want blood flow to be back there so the key thing here is that it's just another example of um you know a chemical signal that's released by adipocytes so we'll kind of review those that sort of affects this kind of stuff so if we look at here's an example of all of the actual compounds we didn't go into all of them that are released by adipocytes and will sort of affect different organ systems the last thing is that it does seem to affect steroid metabolism so like we mentioned already like even things like libido um or the ability to get pregnant may be related to the level of adipocytes you have in your body so we can see that it affects uh sex steroids glucocorticoids or things like stress hormones so glucocorticoids like cortisol is like the primary glucose glucocortis corticoid so when we are in a high stress state it does all kinds of stuff right it messes with our mental it messes with our physical it can mess with our stomach um affects like muscle development affects our rest all of those kinds of things so glucocorticoids will sometimes activate the reticular activating formation which is a part of our brain that causes us to sleep lightly so when we're in a high stress state we don't get as restful sleep which is originally designed to be an adaptive mechanism because if we think about the way that we used to experience stress if i see a tiger footprint like when i go to bed that night i want to be a light sleeper because there's a tiger in the neighborhood our body was not really designed to experience long-term stress so if we think about the way that monkeys get stressed out they don't worry about like paying rent at the end of the month right so they don't experience 29 days of constant stress about things at the end of the month as our society has changed as we worry about things like how am i going to pay for this or how am i going to pay rent or will i be alone forever or i didn't get any tinder matches today it boosts our stress hormones and then that sort of like wreaks havoc on all kinds of different parts of our body including our ability to sleep so we talked we're not going to go into all of these but um you know we talked about il-6 and tnf-alpha which are inflammatory markers and we talked a little bit about leptin we talked about angiotensin these are the clotting factors so this once again is just kind of like a i thought it was really interesting because like it turns out that fat actually has a very profound effect on all kinds of our different systems and sometimes it's really really surprising because when i've worked with patients in the past who will have something like ibs you know it's really interesting what kinds of lifestyle changes can have a clinical impact so this is also where if you all have any of these conditions or you're concerned about this stuff you should absolutely go talk to your doctor about it right say you know hey i have ibs like are there any recommendations that you have for like reducing my body's like inflammatory state and see what your doctor says i think it's a very very good question to ask your doctor um so let me just see if there's anything else in this yeah so this just kind of goes goes uh into more detail so um just to kind of summarize we're going to talk a little bit more but the you know it turns out that adipose tissue is not just fat storage but is actually a complicated endocrine organ the next thing that i want to talk a little bit about is when people sort of discover this what they tend to do is talk a lot about different kinds of like herbs and supplements or food ingredients that will change white fat into brown fat so just this is where let's take a step back so we have two kinds of fat we have white fat and we have brown fat okay and the difference is that white fat we used to think of as storage and brown fat is used for thermogenesis so human beings have a very small level of brown fat whereas bears who hibernate in the winter will have high levels of brown fat and so what what happens is like thermogenesis essentially maintains body temperature is there a couple of other interesting things people in northern climates generally speaking have higher levels of brown fat people with high levels of thyroid hormone also have high levels of brown fat or sorry not tsh t3 t4 very important distinction okay and this may be meat like this these two could be related right so as it gets colder maybe our thyroid hormone goes up and we stimulate thermogenesis the key thing about brown fat is that it actually burns calories so the more brown fat we have like the more calories we burn at like basal metabolic level this is without activity so this is like the amount like you know we maintain a temperature of 98.6 how do we maintain that temperature all the time by burning energy right what what's the cell that burns energy it can be brown fat so what a lot of people will do is as people sort of discover oh fat is an endocrine organ like what are all of the things that reduce brown fat and this is where i think you'll need to be extra careful about like media because oftentimes what we'll see is like a an article that sort of says oh there's a new study that found that green tea reduces like increases fat burning which could be true but i think as we're going to look at this next paper i'm going to invite you all to be a little bit careful about that kind of stuff because oftentimes the media articles won't go into the detail of what kind of study was done and like specifically what they found this is also where if you all are thinking about starting something like a supplement or whatever like absolutely go talk to your doctor about it it's totally fine to you know talk to them because there may be more to the issue than you realize the other thing to remember there's a lot of detail about this in dr k's guide to mental health so we have a video about the safety of using herbal supplements which i highly highly recommend you all check out goes into a lot of detail about how you can get liver toxicity and just how to approach supplements and some of the cautions around like supplements which are tend to be pretty unregulated doesn't mean that they can't help there are a lot of clinical trials which we'll kind of talk about that have shown that herbs and supplements and things like that can have positive impacts for health but you have to be there are a lot of cautionary things to to be concerned about okay so what we're gonna do is talk take a look at a couple of different herbs or chemical compounds like food compounds that will sometimes get advertised as converting white fat to brown fat right and the reason we're sharing this is because a lot of people like watching this they're like oh okay so i need to reduce my amount of white fat how do i do that well if you if you do a google search for reducing white fat what you may find is like articles right from like health line or webmd about here are five things that you can take that have been shown to reduce white fat or to convert white fat to brown fat so let's take a look okay so the first thing that we're going to talk about is capsaicin or capsaid so these are essentially like the spicy ingredient from peppers and capsaicin is a a good example of actually like a pretty well studied thing and i'm going to tunnel down into this so here's one study so snitker published a paper in 2009 where oral treatment with capsinoids in overweight or obese subjects was associated with abdominal fat loss and increase in fat oxidation compared with the placebo group so this was a study that had a sample size of 80 people but there are a couple of important things about it so it's double blind placebo controlled has a sample size of 80 and is in humans okay so this i think like there's decent evidence that capsaicin actually does like reduce the amount of white fat you have and may stimulate brown fat okay there are a lot of other studies that they sort of talk about but we're going to compare this with a couple of other studies so here's a compound that people loved talking about recently not recently like maybe 20 years ago resveratrol so resveratrol is a compound that's it's a natural polyphenol that has been found in red wine and grapes peanuts why is that moving grapes peanuts etc so the key thing about resveratrol is that like people started talking about the health benefits of wine with resveratrol and what they were sort of doing is citing studies and then people were sort of saying like drinking a glass of red wine is like good for your heart and so a lot of people who really enjoyed red wine who had been told for their entire lives that like hey maybe you're drinking a little bit too much maybe you should cut back wine is expensive alcohol is bad for you they're like c c like resveratrol is good so here's another example of like you'll see articles about this where people will say like oh resveratrol has actually been shown to like reduce white fat but let's take a closer look at the actual studies okay so the administration of resveratrol in mice fed with a high fat diet has been shown to reduce the visceral fat pads and suppress adipogenesis okay so like this is very different from the snitker paper because the snicker paper is actually giving human beings like capsaids and measuring what happens whereas like what what's this is this is like giving mice 400 milligrams per kg per day for 10 weeks like i have no idea like look at the i mean this this may not be a one-to-one fair comparison because maybe resveratrol is like less concentrated than capsaicin right because you need just a little bit of pepper but generally speaking with my studies sometimes they'll give these mice like very very high dosages of stuff because they're trying to detect an effect right and it's kind of like mice so you're not worried about compliance you're not worried about like you know like the mice is having side effects and things like that you'll just give them a bunch of stuff so um then you'll also have you know like gene studies or like like uh cellular studies so these are studies that for example will just take a cell culture and they'll measure like how does gene expression change when i when i have a bunch of cells sitting in a petri dish and i squirt some resveratrol like what do the cells start doing differently so this also is like not even i mean they're living cells but it's not even within a human organism i mean it's not even within a mice a mouse organism right um so like the studies for resveratrol tend to be in mice so c is a feeding of my standard diet plus resveratrol induced expression of cert one and ucp genes so there could be something here and this is how science progresses we start by studying things in mice and then we may move on to studying things in primates and eventually we'll move on to studying things in humans but you know this is where we have to be super super careful because like if there's an article that says oh resveratrol did you know resveratrol or drinking a glass of red wine can help you lose weight and like that could be true but just be a little bit careful about the level of of you know evidence that people are talking about um so curcumin is another really good example so curcumin has gotten a lot of uh you know interest recently so um curcumin is the active ingredient in turmeric or one of the active ingredients in turmeric has been used in indian and ayurvedic medicine for many many many years and so what people will do is like they'll say like oh did you know that using turmeric can help you lose weight so um so the turmeric is a good example does have some human studies right so it looks like in this study i think this is a small population size recent clinical trial assess the safety and efficacy of 30-day treatment with cumin combined with phosphatidylserine in overweight subjects undergoing weight loss by diet and lifestyle intervention in the study curcumin administration increased weight loss enhanced fat mass loss and induced reduction in waste to hip circumference but keep in mind this is the other thing that you have to be careful about right because in this study they also administered phosphatidylserine with it so what effect does that have does that mean that i can go to a health food store buy curcumin tablets and lose weight if i just take it right so the answer is we don't know right because in this study like they added this additional compound what is the effect of that additional compound we don't know this is also where some of the study involves uh intra gastric administration of curcumin um 50 milligrams to 100 milligrams per kg daily in mice right so the intragastric is really really important so that means they're not even feeding it they're like putting it directly into the gi system and this is important especially for curcumin because there are some concerns about uh absorption of curcumin through the gi system of especially humans so it's some of the doses that you may need to create this kind of decreased fat pad or whatever humans may not like actually absorb that level so the point here is that you know just be careful because they're all kinds of like caveats when it comes to things like herbal medicine green tea is another thing that has been touted for weight loss for a long time so be a little bit careful about that too um you know so we know that there are beneficial compounds in tea like catechins um so the other thing that we have to be careful about in green tea is like how much of the benefits of green tea are due to caffeine versus the catechins so we know that caffeine has thermogenic properties um and so once again like we've got some rat studies here and we've got some human studies right so with regard to human studies demonstrated that green tea enhances i think ee what is that um enhanced oxidation i think it it improves fatty acid oxidation oh no fat oxidation let's remember blinking what he is oh enhanced energy expenditure so what this sort of refers to is our baseline like energy expenditure um yeah so like like green tea may have a benefit so in terms of uh so this is good so the role of green tea in tackling obesity seem controversial in human trials so like you know there are all kinds of confounding factors which sort of i don't know that popular media will like go into so the key takeaway here is that oftentimes you know especially with things on the frontier of medicine like um you know adipose tissue is an endocrine organ it can be like really really exciting and very informational so do i advocate for having a healthy level like a healthy body weight like absolutely is this you know just a disclaimer i'm not commenting hopefully people are not interpreting this as like having anything to do with body positivity i'm not saying this has anything to do with health i mean beauty standards or anything like that i'm not saying that we should you know lose weight for the sake of being more attractive or fulfilling a society body standard societal body standard what we're talking about today is the the literal biochemical effects of adipose tissue and so whether you're overweight underweight whatever like that that's not sort of what we're talking about we're sort of zeroing in on adipose tissue is a potential contributor to all kinds of physiologic problems and health benefits the key takeaway here is that you know if you are overweight or you do have a very central like fat deposition and you suffer from any of these issues this is something that you should be thinking about and especially if you have like a clinical diagnosis absolutely something you should be talking to your doctor about the last thing to keep in mind is that oftentimes on the frontier of medicine what people will do is like they'll they'll make studies right so it's good that people are studying this stuff oh green tea can help me lose weight green tea can promote thermogenesis green tea can do all these kinds of things they'll make all these kinds of claims and those claims are scientifically valid but they're not really like valid at the level of like human trials right so this is where you all have to be really careful about health related compounds right i know that a lot of people are very interested in neurotropics um so these are things that are sort of good for our brain but just be a little bit careful because oftentimes especially as we sort of you know look at popular dissemination of scientific concepts they're not really like digging down into you know what is the dosage that we're administering to mice are these human trials or mice trials what's the sample size for the human trials in this case it's 80 if memory serves no i don't think it's listed here but um and so just be a little bit careful about that stuff so i think you know sometimes uh i run across things that i think are really really interesting this is something that i personally monitor very very closely because i am really curious about what we're gonna learn about like the endocrine impact of um [Music] fat and and potentially using like weight loss or reducing our central adiposity or even adjusting you know the the genetic activation of particular fat cells so there's some studies that kind of go into that so if we look at like these compounds right this is resveratrol is talking about altering the genetic expression of fat cells and that will in turn adjust all kinds of things so keep this stuff in mind be a little bit careful you know be critical of stuff that you'll come across and if you all have an actual like health condition please go see a doctor about it okay questions looks like we have time for a couple other posts what did i have for breakfast this morning i had half a banana a cup of tea and then a bowl of oatmeal with blueberries is stress an inflammatory state absolutely so stress psychological stress so we can talk about this for a second this is also i think there's a video that goes into a lot of detail about this in dr k's guide so when we have a physiologic state of stress this causes the release of different compounds so let's talk about glucocorticoids like cortisol and cortisol does all kinds of things so i think let me just make sure i understood the caught the question but okay whatever so when we go to cortisol cortisol will have all kinds of different effects so it'll increase blood sugar it'll cause breakdown of fat and muscle why because we want a lot of available energy right it'll also do things like activate our immune system and why is that well let's think about it when do we want cortisol active it's like when we see a tiger in the wilderness right so what's likely to happen if we see a tiger in the wilderness maybe we'll get scratched maybe we'll get bitten all those you know the tigers fangs have all that juicy juicy bacteria which loves getting past your dermis and into your bloodstream so we want our immune system on high alert right it'll also have uh effects on your brain right so it'll it'll make you a light sleeper and this in turn will lead to less restful sleep and so like cortisol will wreak havoc on your body cortisol is a hormone that is designed to sacrifice long-term health for short-term survival that's what our adrenaline system is there for right like we can break down fat and muscle but we need that we need like as much sugar as we can get in our bloodstream so that our muscles when we start to run and fight have an endless supply of energy the challenge is that when we're in this state for a long period of time we end up um actually like you know because we're there's no short-term threat right we're not actually getting attacked by a tiger and so over over time that long-term stress will actually negatively affect us quite profoundly there's another really interesting thing about a cortisol tumor which is that one of the features of a cortisol tumor is something called a buffalo hump so we develop fat pads with cortisol tumors and why is that so generally speaking remember what we're trying to do is we're taking muscle and fat and we're breaking them down into blood sugar and back in the good old evolutionary days we would then use that blood sugar to run or fight so what happens nowadays do we run or fight when we're stressed out when we don't make rent when we're worried about making rent at the end of the month do are we running around and being very active sometimes but usually not usually we're just stressed and then the body gets confused so when we don't use it to run or fight what happens blood sugar starts insulin and then insulin forms creates fat and so essentially what we're doing in high stress straight states is we're converting muscle to fat so i'll just show you all a quick picture okay this is where so this is where like this is literally what happens you get a fat deposition um and then let's look at cushingoid habitus so this is what happens oh this is from facebook but whatever good god so this is what a cushion going habitus looks like so for someone who has high levels of glucocorticoid hormones this is what happens to them oh can you all not see any of this okay gg let me switch over okay let's start from the top okay i'm going to show you all gg okay first thing hopefully i'll caught that but let's start from the top so stress causes the the release of glucocorticoids cortisol is one example cortisol increases blood sugar oh yeah there was absolutely a diagram we'll go through it right now this causes a breakdown of fat and muscle in order to stimulate our blood sugar activates our immune system makes us light sleepers so we get less restful sleep and this this is why like stress is bad for you physiologically right so over time your blood sugar is going to be high your immune system is going to be overly active but there's no infection to fight thus we've got all these soldiers our white blood cells which with itchy trigger fingers that are like in a high alert state and there's nothing to fight so what they end up doing is causing autoimmune problems so we know that stress worsens autoimmune disease also causes us to be light sleepers which means we don't get deep restful sleep last thing that we're going to talk a little bit about in terms of the metabolism i think this is super interesting so if you have a cortisol tumor or cushing's disease you can get something called buffalo hump and what happens here remember that when we create cortisol what we're doing is we're breaking down muscle and fat to stimulate blood sugar and once we have high levels of blood sugar we normally want those so that we can run or fight right so we want like as much energy available to our calves and our thighs and our arms as possible and generally speaking when we see a tiger let's say 10 million years ago if we saw a tiger what we would do is like hike eight miles right like we want to just get the hell away from the tiger so we need a lot of energy for our skeletal muscles but nowadays when we get stressed we're not running or fighting so then then we have a bunch of blood sugar in our bloodstream and then like after a while the cortisol starts to wear off and because there's a antagonistic relationship between cortisol and insulin in some ways and then we secrete insulin and what does insulin do stores all that blood sugar as fat so when we're in a stressed state we are literally converting muscle into fat and what that results in is something called a cushingoid habitus okay so this is where like this is literally what happens to people's bodies you'll see wasting of the arms and legs like muscles and you'll see fat deposition so this is a buffalo hump okay good question so we should exercise when stressed absolutely you should absolutely exercise when you're stressed so there's something really cool about exercise one key thing about exercise which is why it's so good for all this blood sugar stuff when you exercise your muscles will absorb blood sugar without insulin i mean yeah without insulin right so generally speaking what that means is that you are getting you're lowering your blood sugar without insulin and so remember insulin is going to activate your body's physiology to store that sugar as fat and so when you exercise it makes so the insulin resistance that you get with high levels of adiposity exercise counteracts that like almost directly because what because remember with insulin resistance you're not going to be absorbing blood sugar from the from the bloodstream right and so when you exercise it actually bypasses that whole mechanism it recruits a completely different physiologic mechanism where it's like because you're exercising now right so we don't care about like you're using your muscles so your body's like well if you're if my muscles are active like they need energy so let's absorb this stuff let's pull blood sugar out of the bloodstream as the blood sugar gets pulled out of the bloodstream and your blood sugar levels drop then your body's like oh like we have low blood sugar so let's break down fat let's break down liver glycogen let's break down different things so that we can add more blood sugar to the bloodstream so a lot of like you know i don't know if you guys have seen this but the actual caloric change from exercise is quite small right like i think if you run a mile or something you'll burn like 50 calories like it's it's very small i don't know exactly what the number is the key thing though is that all these benefits from exercise are not about the direct energy expenditure they're about adjustments to your body's metabolism the basic way your body is operating and when we have like a sedentary life when we're just sort of sitting in our chair all day like all those effects get like they're in the wrong direction those numbers are really off let's see how many calories does running a mile burn okay so it looks like so it looks like it's 100 calories so according to a chart from the american council on exercise a 120 pound person burns about 11.4 calories per minute while running so if you run a 10 minute mile you'll burn 114 calories right so one mile will burn 100 calories it's not that bad my point is that there's so if we the key thing there is that like when you run that mile it's not just the calories that you burn it's the fact that like you're activating your whole body's like metabolism and so then over the next 24 hours you will like burn even more calories because your body is like doing stuff right so when you run for example presumably your your leg muscles will get stronger so when you hypertrophy your your leg muscles what what's going to end up happening is like there that hypertrophy the building up of the leg muscle will require energy it's not just about protein right it's like the end like the metabolism involved right so remember that like even we're sitting around doing absolutely nothing we tend to burn about 2000 calories a day that's just the maintenance of your body requires 2000 calories like respiration heartbeat all that kind of stuff uh yeah so so i mean you may not get too much hypertrophy yeah so anandamide is is originally a compound that i'm not too familiar in a bunch of details but my understanding of anandamide is it's the compound that is in marijuana right like so i think the original person who coined anandamide was i think they were indian and they were studying marijuana uh isn't the brain the most consuming of our energy if you look at the weight energy ratio i'm not sure i would so it's definitely one of the highest consumers of glucose for sure so we'd you know at some point we may have to do like a very in-depth discussion about marijuana because i think it's like one of these topics where people will make like so someone's asking questions is weed good for stress so that implies that like there's a binary effect right so like either i say yes or i say no but the truth is like hopefully if you all have been paying attention like the key takeaway when it comes to like physiology as well as like psychology is that it's complicated right it's not it's not like absolutely good and it's not absolutely bad the other thing to remember is that anytime you're talking about an intervention for a problem it's a risk benefit analysis whether you're talking about a medication or a substance or even exercise there's like a risk benefit analysis right so running for example is very good for your cardiovascular health but like can be very hard on the knees so we can talk about it the answer is in my opinion it's complicated so like that's where you know there's an individual discussion that i'll oftentimes have with patients about whether like marijuana is like appropriate for them or not generally speaking i don't advocate for regular marijuana use for most people i think there's some absolute exceptions to that like in terms of like i've seen very very good effects for marijuana use in people who are undergoing chemotherapy like um i even saw a study recently that marijuana may have some positive impact on covid related stuff but like that that also is like these studies are you know they're like very initial so a lot of times people who want to use marijuana and are looking for a justification will jump on these studies whereas and then similarly you'll have people on the other end of the spectrum who are like all drugs are bad and will like be like oh never use marijuana all these studies like they can't be trusted because the truth is like just like any other anything else we put in our body like chances are you know this herbs that is like so compounds that are supposed to be in our body right we're not talking about like like clearly toxic stuff but you know when we talk about things that human beings will ingest or inhale like there's a variety of different effects you
