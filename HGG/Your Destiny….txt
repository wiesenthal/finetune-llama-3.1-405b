if i can't even be the one percent in what i'm good at and what i'm passionate about how on earth am i ever going to be the one percent at this engineering firm i feel like i'm destined for mediocrity this post is probably going to come off a little bit desperate slash pathetic but i needed a space to type it out and be heard as the title says i feel like i'm destined to live a mediocre life i'm a more creative person a creative mind person and i get bored very easily doing monotonous tasks that don't allow me to express myself in any way issue is in the real world only the best get to make their dreams slash passions a lucrative reality and i've tried for so long to become the best but i'm starting to think that my best will just never be good enough everyone around me always seems to think that i'm destined for some great thing as if they're seeing something about me that i'm not but they're not nearly as knowledgeable about my craft as i am so they can't see that i'm not cut out for it i'm better than the average person but being better than average doesn't mean you'll get noticed or be able to make a job out of your passions i feel like i need to learn to be content with a life of misery in the rat race as many others have it feels like the only option i have what do you all think i know this probably didn't make much sense but any words would be appreciated so this is something that a lot of people struggle with and what happens is you grow up or you're growing up and you recognize that you're different from the average path of success so you you look around and you look at the people who have like stable jobs and are happy and are quote unquote successful whatever and what you tend to find is like these people are like they're pretty like monotonous right so it's like oh this person was successful because like every day after school they went home and they studied and they did their extracurriculars on thursday nights and on saturday mornings they did volunteering and then they joined the swimming team and then they got into a good college and they studied every day after school and they did college swimming and then they got into a good grad school or they got hired as an engineer here they picked some like boring monotonous major that has a good starting salary and job security and then they became successful and so you kind of look at this and you're like well like if i was living that person's life i would go insane like i couldn't do it i couldn't go into the office every single day and like do the same crap you know whatever that job is or this job or whatever like i just get way too bored with that i'm a creative person and then like the problem is that like you look at this sort of successful path in life and you kind of say okay this doesn't really work for me and then you recognize that it does work for some people right so like some people have like you you visited an art gallery and there's like a painting there that someone is selling for like two hundred thousand dollars and you're like wow like so apparently it's possible but how many people make art and how many people sell a painting for 200 grand how many people have their art featured in a gallery so you kind of realize that there's like there are two paths right you can be the monotonous path where you can still get you can become relatively successful because like they want to pee on or you can go to the creative path where like 99 of people are starving artists right and even if you think about it societally we don't talk about the starving software engineer i mean maybe we they i'm sure they exist but the the idea is the starving artist right and then you recognize that even if you want to you can be successful but like the chances of success in your given your talents and strengths is really low and so then what happens is you sort of end up kind of like resigning yourself to a life of misery you're like i guess the only way for me to like be content in life is to accept misery that's my strategy right because like you're you're not in the top one percent i mean even this person is saying i'm better than average but i ain't in the top one percent and so the only conclusion that you kind of come to is like well it seems like i'm destined for mediocrity so what i'm going to do is learn to be content with a life of misery be a part of the rat race and since it's not my passion i'm gonna be destined for mediocrity because how can i ever be the one percent if i can't even be the one percent in what i'm good at and what i'm passionate about how on earth am i ever gonna be the one percent at this engineering firm so how do you navigate this it's super hard so let's understand a couple of things first so if we look at this post what we see is that this person starts with ideas okay so let's just take a quick look at what some of these ideas are okay so i get bored easily with monotonous tasks in issue is in the real world only the best get to make their passion dream slash passions a lucrative reality right so this is kind of like a key idea so there's like the monotonous people they can be successful i'm not monotonous and only the best make passion a reality so we start with these ideas and then what happens is we become miserable right because if all these things are true and we believe them to be true we're not idiots we believe these things for a reason we go to art galleries and we see you know one out of a thousand artists actually selling paintings as we become miserable we then conclude that the my only choice i feel like i need to i feel like i need to learn to be content with a life of misery it feels like the only option i have is to become content so where is this person's focus what are they going to learn where are they going to invest their energy they're going to invest their energy over here so they're going to learn how to meditate they're going to learn they're going to learn how to journal you know they're going to learn try to learn detachment they're going to do all this really important internal work to be content with a life of misery forget the oxymoron there in a second because if you're content then you're not miserable but whatever this is doomed to failure but this is where they focus on and what do you think this actually does to this part nothing so the first thing to understand is that when you adopt this mentality not only is it true you're making it true it becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy because you invest your energy here instead of changing this because this person doesn't have an option to build a life that is less miserable like literally they say the only it feels like the only option i have is to be content with misery we'll get into why that is in a second but then there are a couple of other interesting things to understand so when i'm miserable about my life enter this this is an interesting thing right everyone around me seems it seems to think i'm destined for great things but they're clueless right it's like when your mom is like oh beta you are so handsome any any woman would be lucky to marry you you're so good child you're the bestest you're the smartest you are so handsome oh and so everyone around you offers you reassurance right they say all these kinds of things oh it's okay you're so talented you're a genius oh beta you're a genius and how does that make us feel when you're like 25 years old and you're alone and you haven't been on a date in two years and your mom is sitting there telling you that you're the most handsome most wonderful man in the world in the world or you're a woman and your dad is telling you that or you're a woman and your mom is telling you that whatever right it makes you feel worse it actually increases your misery as it increases your misery you double down on this and so you kind of like doom yourself to trying to become content with misery as opposed to fixing the misery and when you stop trying to actually improve your life that's when it really becomes true and then as you and then a year goes by right so a year goes by and then like you're more miserable misery leveled up and then you're like man i got to learn me some copium coping skills be content meditate harder i'm not meditating good enough and the cycle repeats itself okay so let's understand a couple of interesting things here so why does this happen why do we resign ourselves to being content like it's kind of weird right because what we actually need to do is be like if we want to solve this problem we don't want to like resign ourselves to being content we actually want to feel kind of bad and use that badness to improve our situation in a weird way so here's the thing what do you all think is the primary emotion that is controlling this person's life pay attention to the question what do y'all think is the primary emotion so people are saying self-pity resentment fear shame so now i'm going to ask you all a different question doubt shame discouragement jealousy fear okay so i'm going to ask you two questions what do you think is the primary motion this person is feeling and what do you think is the primary emotion that is controlling their life and that may sound weird because aren't those two things the same absolutely not right so here's so a lot of people are saying hopelessness despair things like that so let's understand this we're feeling hopelessness but what's actually controlling their life is fear this is what i experience but at the root of this is fear now let's understand this very simply so when i'm afraid of something what which of these three steps is an antidote to fear right so if i were to say ideas misery contentment right it's kind of interesting so this is where i want you all to understand this when i'm afraid of something okay we're going to figure this out let's say you're afraid of something happening what is something that you can do mentally to make yourself feel better about that fear what do you tell yourself so if i'm afraid that you can avoid it right so if i'm afraid that like i'm gonna i'm gonna fail this test what do i tell myself when i'm sitting down to take the test yeah so so some people are gonna say like i couldn't have done it anyways perfect zander on right oh this is already gonna fail there's no way i can pass might as well just try because there's no way i can pass so it's interesting because if you assume the worst case scenario and if you really pay attention to your fears what you'll find is assuming the worst case scenario is actually protective against the fear because the whole point of fear is that it's uncertain it could happen and it may not happen but if i accept the worst case scenario and i learn to survive that then the worst of the damage is done and the uncertainty is actually removed from the equation do you all get that so contentment and resignation is actually a coping mechanism to fear do you all get that because if i resign myself to it if i just assume if i tell myself there's no way that this person will love me they're definitely going to break up with me they're definitely going to break up with me you're definitely going to agree i can tell you want to be out of this relationship i can tell now let's look at that well you're afraid that the person is going to break up with you and how do you does your mind actually adapt to that it moves into resignation it assumes it has true there's no way i'm gonna get this job it's impossible i'm so under qualified i'm afraid i won't get this job and so what does your mind do to protect you from that disappointment it makes you resigned and then the interesting thing is if you're afraid that someone's gonna break up with you and you go talk to your friends about it and they're like no no no you're like the best person in the world like no one would ever break up with you you're so beautiful you're so amazing anyone would be lucky to be with you how does that make you feel does that reassure you absolutely not makes you more miserable so now we begin to see how this this sequence is actually rooted in fear that the reassurance doesn't reassure reassurance makes you feel more miserable makes you feel more resigned because the mind sort of has this thing where like i can protect myself against the fear by being resigned and this is not just humans that do this right so like you'll see this like in animals who give up as well so like giving up is like a biologically conserved thing across species there's no point in wasting my energy when the conclusion is fixed right it's not just humans like animals will give up too so if you want to break out and i know it sounds kind of weird but it's like i feel like i'm destined for mediocrity what you've got to fix is the fear the fear is at the root of all of this you're afraid because here's like let me put it to you this way and you all tell me if you think this fits only best only the best get to make their dreams or passions a lucrative reality i guess i have to resign myself to a life of mediocrity and like doing some kind of monotonous task and suffer like everyone else i'm gonna rephrase this for y'all and you tell me if you think this fits you're not destined for mediocrity i think that this person is afraid that if they give it their all if they actually pursue their passions and if they don't take the safe route if they don't take the monotonous route five years of sweat and blood in tears and they still won't be successful ten years and they still won't be successful they're terrified of taking the road less traveled and ending them up like in the desert where like their sol how does the mind protect you from that it says no no no my friend you are destined for mediocrity don't walk that road it's an unsafe road learn to be content with a life of misery and join the rat race where things are safe this is fear it's all fear so a couple of other things that we'll sort of end with one is that let's talk about destiny for a second so destiny implies linearity right the whole point is that no matter what i do i'm gonna end up here so like there's like a linearity to destiny does that sort of make sense there's not but this isn't what life is like right this is really what life is like so i've got a choice do i want to major in engineering or design okay i chose design do i want to work at a big firm or do i want to focus on my art for a year am i going to do an internship over here or a fellowship over here am i going to [Music] learn how to use this am i going to learn how to use photoshop or am i going to learn am i going to spend some time painting this is really what life is like there's no destiny in life i mean there sort of is but it's not like this because you have a lot of agency in life and you can still end up here from here and so in a sense like you can still you know make a a straight chain kind of like you did here the key thing is though there's a lot of branches there's a lot of choice there's a lot of agency and this is where like this person makes a couple of these assumptions like issue is in the real world only the best get to make their dreams or passion to lucrative reality like i don't know what this person is basing the statement on i don't know where this idea comes from and if you're a creative minded person like just to give you all a simple example i was working with someone a couple years ago who was very creatively minded and they also like to travel and they're like i'm not really sure like what job is for me like i really like art like i appreciate art but i don't my favorite thing to do is like go to different places and see like local art but i don't want to like make these like african portraits and stuff from cuba and things like that i just really like looking at it and i'm very creative i'm really good at like decorating and things like that and so like how can you turn that into a job so they did something really interesting they moved to a city in the united states where a lot of people were moving to from another part of the country and generally speaking these people are wealthy so what they sort of discovered is that wealthy people don't like to have mass-produced art in their home but also like wealthy people can't necessarily afford like a rembrandt so they started like an interior design service where they like would help people decorate their new homes and their big thing is i'm gonna source this with unique art from all over the world that's fair trade so you will get a unique piece of artwork that no one else in the world has and it'll come from some you know every piece of artwork has a backstory so they traveled for a while they took a bunch of pictures they even bought a few pieces and they came back and like i kid you not in the city i know someone else who moved to the city recently all of the interior decorators had at least a three to six month wait list to even get an appointment and this person is like very happy now it's wild like i don't know how sustainable that is i don't know that y'all can go and do this my point is that like if you pay attention to the world and you bring real value to it chances are you offer what you have to give there will be people who will want it right so this is where someone hybrid area says that can't happen for everyone you are correct and also which part of your mind is generating that thought so as i say that as i say hey by the way this is actually a possibility if you say that can't happen for everyone i'll completely agree with you that's not the solution for everyone but the resign part of your mind is going to say things like that right because it's going to say don't bother going down this route just be content with misery and this is where i'd say it's not the best that make their dreams or passion reality it's the people who really try and are open-minded and are flexible with how they make how they actualize what they're interested in because there's a big gap between i'm a creative person and i need to be an artist maybe you could be an interior decorator maybe you could do graphic design maybe you could make nfts on gamestop's new nft market who knows right my point is that it's it's not about like and when you start out like all you see if you want to end up over here your first two choices are this you may never be able to end up here but i don't necessarily know that even if you make it over here that you'll necessarily be happy with this because this we've seen in our community a lot where people are like i did everything i was supposed to do and i'm not happy i got an engineering degree and i find it spiritually unfulfilling i was good at math so i decided to do engineering the whole point is like if you want to be content in life like you got to learn some amount of internal contentment sure but then recognize that like destiny in life is not that fixed you have a lot of choices and recognize that what life is life is like chess it's not like a linear game and so what you should do is every step of the way make this move the piece that feels the best to you at the time because what happens is everyone who makes all the right moves in life usually ends up in the wrong place and so if you want to end up in the right place what you've really got to do is be very careful about making in a sense quote unquote the wrong moves right like oh i like math so i'm going to major in or i'm good at math so i'm going to major in something that i'm good at as opposed to something that i care about so it's challenging we oftentimes feel like we're destined for mediocrity and it's not like it's not like you're there's a lot about that thought process that feels right the problem though is that even though the primary emotion that we feel is despair and so we try to tackle despair and we're going to learn how to be content with ourselves how do i learn how to be content with misery and when i start focusing on being content instead of not being miserable like when i stop actually like when i resign myself to my circumstances that's what actually becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy so this really starts with understanding like what is it that you're afraid of and once we let that fear once we tackle that fear in some way process that fear even vocalize that fear i'm not saying it's going to go away and you'll be fear free because the antidote to that fear is ironically resignation because if you assume the worst and you can manage to survive that you can even tell right so i need to learn how to survive the worst and then i'll be okay so let me choose the worst thing let me actually move towards the worst thing and all i have to do is survive a worst case scenario and then everything above that becomes easier it's so challenging because the way that our mind helps us cope with fear is actually through resignation but the moment that you become resigned that destiny actually becomes true you
