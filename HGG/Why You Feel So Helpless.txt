the problem with obsessive thoughts is that we get caught up in them right we start to think that our mind is correct we start to think that our thoughts are facts and so oftentimes what i do when i'm working with people who have obsessive thoughts is that they can sort of with detachment learn to accept that their mind produces obsessive thoughts and so the solution there is to detach from our mind and just acknowledge that like there's a difference between i want a hamburger and my body wants a hamburger or my mind wants a hamburger it's fine for your mind to produce these thoughts the question is do you want to act in accordance with the thoughts that your mind produces yes or no and that applies for delusions it applies for anxiety it applies for insecurity that your actions and how you behave does not have to be in accordance with those thoughts [Music] acceptance versus learned helplessness how can one distinguish between the two yeah so this is a it's a good question so a lot of people will wonder a little bit about okay what's the difference between acceptance and learned helplessness so let's kind of talk about this for a minute uh some time ago some psychologists really coined a very interesting concept which is learned helplessness and learn helplessness is this idea that over time you learn to be helpless so generally speaking when we face challenges it is the natural human response to try to overcome that challenge and like succeed in some way so in the face of adversity we're going to rise up to the challenge and we're going to learn how to beat it what's happened though is that some people learn over time that like there's no way to win so we'll see this in cases of like complex ptsd or cptsd we'll see this in a lot of other cases of abuse or trauma or things like that where you kind of learn that resistance is futile right and so often times you'll see this in cases of like you know domineering parents or things like that where like you're you sort of get divested of your own power and your own agency and so then when you get faced with a challenge what happens is instead of trying to rise above the challenge and address the challenge and things like that what you end up doing is um just giving up right and so what what happens with people with learned helplessness is that they learn to give up very very easily and so if something doesn't work right away you just kind of like you sort of give up and now recently what's sort of happened is there's been a big push for something called acceptance so even in um you know in in like psychotherapy for example there's a kind of therapy called acceptance and commitment therapy or act which is sort of rooted originally in cognitive behavioral therapy and then what they sprinkle in is this eastern concept of acceptance which is that you have to like accept what's happened in life as opposed to focus on changing it and and it's kind of interesting right so like the the weird thing there is that if we sort of accept what happens in life instead of trying to change it then don't we sort of end up in the same place as learned helplessness which is like we're just gonna let it kind of happen and so this is a really common question and can be quite confusing right so if i accept something how does that help isn't that the same as not doing anything about it and it's a good question but in my experience actually quite the opposite so the first is that we can look at studies on things like acceptance and commitment therapy or act and what we find is that those studies are very very potent at revealing that sort of this acceptance philosophy can lead to good clinical outcomes so act is oftentimes used in addiction kind of scenarios and we sort of see this historically as well so if you look at alcoholics anonymous which is a you know historically effective organization and helping people overcome addiction kind of the first rule of of alcoholics anonymous is you know you go up and you say hi my name is all look i'm an alcoholic and so it's kind of weird because if you're sort of like admitting defeat there right if you're saying i'm an alcoholic period then doesn't that mean that you're gonna drink and paradoxically the answer is no paradoxically what happens when you accept is it actually allows you to gain control over the behavior so let's kind of go into this for a second so oftentimes what happens in in addiction and this is what sort of act posits is that it's our ability to like it's it's our attempts to resist the addiction that actually cause us the most problems and so by accepting the fact that we're addicted once you sort of accept that foundation then suddenly you can actually like gain power over it which i know sounds really paradoxical because if you accept that you're powerless in the face of alcohol which is what aa espouses then how on earth do you get control over it and that's kind of weird but that's sort of how it works we just sort of know that from a data perspective and i'll try to explain a little bit of my understanding of how that works so as long as i can win against alcohol the addict's brain is gonna like have a field day with that and if you look at people who struggle with addictions oftentimes what you find is this sense that i can win right i can manage it i can fix it i can reduce it i can control it but the problem is that all of those thoughts of like okay i can manage it as long as i don't get a dui drinking is fine as long as i don't drive drunk drinking is fine as long as dot dot dot playing games is fine as long as long as dot dot dot you know i can get high as long as dot dot dot right that stuff doesn't apply to me like i am in control the problem is that when you have that thought in your head that i am in control or i can gain control oftentimes that is the thought that your addiction thrives on that's what it uses because it tells you because it knows that it's actually in control the only way that the addiction can guarantee success is if it can convince you that you are in control and so this kind of goes to almost like this saying that you know the greatest trick the devil ever pulled was convincing the world he didn't exist right so as long as your addiction can convince you that you're in control and that you can handle it you're going to keep using and we sort of see that right we see that people who insist on getting in control like you know like they're the ones who end up in the biggest problems and so what alcoholics anonymous sort of realized like what the original person the guy who wrote the big book i forget his name what he kind of realized is like the first step is admitting that you're gonna lose and interestingly enough by admitting that you're going to lose all of the tactics that your addiction uses the trump card that your addiction actually plays it's like secret weapon that you you don't even know that it's using it right like it's actually you think you're using it but it's using you it's controlling you so what you're actually doing is taking away the trump card by sort of saying hi my name is olok i'm an alcoholic and i'm powerless in the face of alcohol because if you're powerless in the face of alcohol like going to the barbecue you're not going to be able to resist so don't go to the barbecue if you're powerless in the face of alcohol it doesn't matter whether you can control it or not control it i got to go to the meeting every single day that's what it takes have any shot of any kind of success and and failure is kind of around the corner and so this is sort of what what a ace kind of discovered with with acceptance aaa has some problems with it i think generally speaking and so you know there are certain adaptations which there's certain things about aaa that don't fit with people which i think makes a lot of sense so i personally think that aaa is a little bit too disempowering like i think it's better to understand the trick that your mind does then assume that you're actually powerless because i think you are powerful you are in control as long as your mind isn't tricking you and so that's the attitude that i take so i think there are a lot of issues with aaa and also it doesn't work for everyone right so then this even it so what then what happened is people took this a kind of uh ability of acceptance and then they applied it to acceptance and commitment therapy and they removed a lot of the bad stuff from aa and they kind of applied it to act act as an evidence-based treatment for addiction so that works really well so then the question kind of becomes okay like let's talk about you for a moment and acceptance versus learned helplessness and what's the difference so learned helplessness is about the future right so if we think about it very simply in learned helplessness i am here now and there is no point in trying because of something in the future i realize that that looks weird in the wrong direction it's like you know we're looking into the future and there's no point in trying because it's not going to work so learn helplessness is forward thinking in its nature it's like looking into the future and saying there's no point in trying now the interesting thing about acceptance is acceptance brings you to the present so acceptance is how you get out of the future and especially out of the past so a lot of times what will happen is you know until you accept what has happened to you you're kind of stuck in the past you're like engaged in contrafactual thinking which i don't know if you all remember we talked about but our mind has this ability to go back into the past and hypothesize a different set of outcomes if only i had dot dot dot so when you're struggling in the present sometimes what the mind does it goes into the past and starts thinking if only i had dot dot dot if only i'd studied harder if i only i had taken classes seriously if only i hadn't dated this person if only i hadn't done this this this then i wouldn't be in this scenario right now and so what your mind actually spends its time doing is instead of focusing on the present focusing on what you can do to get out of this all it thinks about is what you should have done differently to avoid the situation which if you think about it as cognitive energy that will never help you because you can't actually go back into time it's like all of your problem solving energy is going to rewrite the past which is physically impossible instead of trying to figure out what to do in the present so this is where acceptance comes in so acceptance sort of takes all that crap from the past and then sort of sorry this way takes all that crap from the past and then kind of like lets it all go and then you kind of accept where you are now right so if i accept i'll say but i i did i didn't take it seriously right i did end up dating that person or in the case of something like grief like that person did pass away right i did lose a loved one and that i have to accept that because until you accept that you're kind of stuck in that past if only i'd done this if only i'd done this if only i'd done this and that's part of the grieving process so we also know that the grieving process involves acceptance and that's generally speaking is a healthy thing to go through so when you actually accept what it helps you do is sit in the present and then actually look forward to the future in a positive way whereas learned helplessness is all about making an assumption about the future that makes you not act today and this is what's really confusing about acceptance is a lot of people think okay if i accept that i failed out of college does that doesn't that mean that i don't do anything no actually the opposite so when you accept that you failed college okay here i am now i failed out of college what am i going to do about it where do i go from here and generally speaking when you lean into acceptance and you learn how to accept you accept your present circumstances and then there's a natural tendency to start like looking to the future in sort of a positive way but even looking at the future is not about looking out here it's about okay what can i do now what's the first step that i can take that'll help me like put my life together and that's what acceptance entails so acceptance just helps us move to the present helps us get out of the past because as long as we're stuck in the past it's going to be really hard to act and the problem with learned helplessness is that's when we're stuck in the future and we assume that any action that we take is not going to be successful but just because i accept that in the past i have failed does not mean that i'm going to continue to fail right and this is what what confuses a lot of people is they assume that okay if you accept that you are a failure no that's not what you accept right i am a failure is actually learned helplessness what you accept is that you have failed period and that if you had done things differently sure you could have changed stuff but you can still do things differently now right you still have a choice now and how you choose to live the next day of your life the next hour of your life the next month of your life is still up to you and under your control and that comes through acceptance so a lot of this stuff is like all about developing a present focus and this is what yoga essentially discovered all this stuff is rooted in yoga all this mindfulness stuff dbt act it's all rooted in yoga and i'm pretty sure that's a historically accurate statement you know um i i imagine i'm biased there but also it seems like it's pretty historically accurate so if you kind of look at that like this present focused stuff is what's really really powerful in terms of putting your life together and generally speaking when people accept it helps them put their life together whereas learned helplessness is kind of like a strategy to avoid pain through avoiding effort so since i'm gonna fail i might as well not try and then like at least i won't i'll protect myself from the disappointment of hope because that's what really happens in learned helplessness is that you learn over time that hoping and failing is painful so what we're going to do is we're going to like shoot for like neutral and we're going to shoot for numbness and by shooting for numbness and not trying to achieve anything like we protect ourselves from disappointment and the feeling of failure can acceptance be used with obsessive thoughts how do i use it great question that's why i love yoga so what yoga would say is accept that you have obsessive thoughts right it doesn't mean that you have to agree with the thoughts but you can accept that your mind is obsessed with something you could say this is just the way that my mind is right so like sometimes if you've got an old war injury and when the weather gets cold your war injury aches that's just what it's going to do when the weather gets cold when it gets damp my bones ache and is that unfortunate sure does it cause you some degree of pain absolutely does it suck for you yes and you can just kind of accept it and so often times what i do when i'm working with people who have obsessive thoughts is that they can sort of with detachment learn to accept that their mind produces obsessive thoughts and by doing that what you actually do the problem with obsessive thoughts is that we get caught up in them right we start to think that our mind is correct we start to think that our thoughts are facts this is in cognitive behavioral therapy what's called thought fusion in yoga it's called attachment and so the the solution there is to detach from our mind and just acknowledge that like there's a difference between i want a hamburger and my body wants a hamburger or my mind wants a hamburger right there's some distance that you can gain from and especially when i work with people who are psychotic that works very well delusional and it's like i'm i have no idea whether you're correct or incorrect with your delusions it's not my place to say i'm not the arbiter of truth it's fine for your mind to produce these thoughts the question is do you want to act in accordance with the thoughts that your mind produces yes or no and that applies for delusions it applies for anxiety it applies for insecurity that your actions and how you behave does not have to be in accordance with those thoughts you know when i work with people who are delusional what they tend to discover is like that works really well if they practice it and they give it a shot and they may sometimes feel terrified if they think the fbi is watching them it's like you can't convince them by nature of their illness that their fbi fbi isn't watching them i can't give them proof and who knows like maybe the fbi is watching them i actually had one case of someone that was actually being followed by the fbi as it turns out so you have no idea um what's going on it's it's bizarre i know so but but the point is like like the question at least you know when i'm working with a patient like that is like do you want to keep the fbi watching you from leaving your house it's like if you leave the hou like forget about whether the fbi is watching you or not do you want to leave the house or not well i hate being at home well like do they watch you at home they're like yeah right so then go out anyway like if they're watching you might as well go to a park and hang out and have a good time and then eventually someone's like oh okay i'll try that and i'll be like how'd that go going to the park and they're like well yeah you're right the fbi followed me that's like i'm not sure i ever said that but you know at least i had a good time i was like cool so you can do it again this week they're like yeah i'm thinking about going out again this week that's great right so you can detach from your thoughts and that's very possible it's it's hard don't get me wrong it's not easy it takes effort and this is where things like practices like meditation even doing things like psychotherapy can be very helpful um but you can absolutely detach from them how do you avoid falling from detachment into apathy the two are completely different okay so this is the big problem that people have with acceptance they think that acceptance means apathy apathy is actually in the learned helplessness right so if we think about apathy i don't care there's no point in trying that's apathy detachment is not not caring it's acknowledging you can still want things and be detached the the difference is acknowledging that things are kind of like out of your control so i can want to go on a date with someone but i also don't have to be attached to it it's like yeah it'd be great if this happened i'd really enjoy it i'm really looking forward to it and at the end of the day there are a thousand reasons why why it may not happen and if one of those things comes to pass so be it right like life is the kind of situation where you don't get everything that you want and then if you go in to learn helplessness or apathy so then why bother trying no no that's where you cross the line right so this person didn't want to go on a date with me which is okay am i disappointed sure it would have been awesome if they were willing to give me a shot and there are other fish in the sea right so i don't have to let it get me down i can try again lots of different options out there i can also have a fruitful weekend if this person if i'm not gonna go on a date with this weekend i can go hang out with my friends i can play some dnd you know i can do all kinds of stuff so that's where detachment comes in detachment isn't about not enjoying life or being numb it's about letting go of the outcomes of your actions and actually fully devoting yourself to the action itself and this is where like even when i work with medical students a lot of medical students are very interested in getting a's because that's what they've been conditioned to do their entire life middle school a's high school a's college a's applying to med school i've got a 3.98 gpa an and are they so resentful it's not a 4.0 and then they wind up in med school and eventually i have to like have a conversation with them about your grades don't matter i don't think you get it a few years from now like you're gonna be in an elevator and someone's gonna have a heart attack are you gonna be able to save that person's life or not who the hell cares whether you get an a or not i don't think you understand you're here to learn medicine so learn medicine and forget about the grade recognize that what we're teaching you will either save lives or you won't learn it well enough and you may not be able to save that life that's what you should focus on so focus on the learning not the outcome and the med students who get that do really well paradoxically once again right because then they focus on learning the material which tends to translate into doing well on the tests but they're learning the material for the sake of learning the material and so it's that same kind of thing it's really tricky it's subtle but detachment and apathy are the opposite apathy is not caring in the sense of like numbing yourself whereas detachment is about acknowledging that there's only so much that you can do and then actually giving it your all because usually people who are detached can give it their all because once you free yourself from all the shame and all the other crap then you can just focus on the thing right i can ask this person out and it's because i'm looking for a relationship and like i'm going to give everything that i can to this relationship and if it didn't work out it didn't work out so be it i can't control another person's behavior i can't control the circumstances of their life but i gave it everything i could and the next time around i'm gonna do the same damn thing so detachment paradoxically allows you to live life with the opposite of apathy and it sort of protects you against a lot of the suffering how do you know if you are avoiding the emotion by being in the present like rationalizing so that's a great question uh rationalizing is not being in the present first of all so rationalizing is avoiding the emotion so what's happening in rationalizing is the emotion is fueling a rationalization that allows you to discount the emotion being in the present is usually sitting with the emotion so it's not being in the present and avoiding emotion are not those are mutually exclusive the whole point of being in the present is you're there with whatever's there avoidance of emotion is about moving away from the present right like does that make sense because i'm feeling sad right now and i want to avoid that emotion i'm not being in the present the whole point is avoidance like this is what it is and i'm like moving away from that that's where rationalizing comes in and you can't avoid the present in fact moving into the future and moving into the past are the ways that you avoid the present like does that make sense it's like so simple but like you can't be in the present and the future at the same time that's what your mind does that's why we engage in contrafactual thinking which is going back in time and rewriting history because we're avoiding the present that's why we think about the future that's why we you know have daydreams like maladaptive daydreaming that's also why we are hopeless about the future because the interesting thing is if i'm hopeless about the future it gives me a free pass in the present i don't have to do anything right now you ever think about that right it's kind of weird but you have a pass for doing nothing in the present right so if i'm doomed to be alone forever because the opposite sex or whatever sex i'm attracted to is all shallow and and useless and all they care about are things that i don't have then if it's futile then i don't have to do anything right all i get to do is [ __ ] at people on twitter all day long about how unfair the world is instead of actually doing anything to fix my life and i can blame the world and then i don't have to do then my body doesn't have to get up out of the chair and start exercising and clean my house and all this other crap that my body doesn't want to do i don't have to clean out my fridge and go buy groceries and cook every day and wake up at 6 a.m like think about how much your body and mind hate doing that crap and when you give up on the future when things are helpless when you're when you have learned helplessness you have a pass for all that stuff you don't have to do any of that little crap why bother right so really what your mind is getting out of that is the ability to be like completely chill in the present uh the absolution of all responsibilities from today that's what learned helplessness buys you and just think that's why it's so hard to kick because if you can do something about it then it maybe is your fault and if you can do something about it maybe you do need to work your ass off but the thing is i don't want to work my ass off and i don't want it to be my fault so what i'm going to end up doing is leaning into helplessness because that's how my addictive mind can just play video games all day easy you all get that it's tricky yeah as is fern de luna saying take back your agency 100 you don't even have to i mean take back is a good sense i'd say pick it up because it's not like you gave it away you just set it down right but how you start with the smallest thing that you can do today you live in the present right so when people say the smallest thing why do we use the word small it's because if we think about something big what does your mind do it sneaks in oh my god that's too hard oh my god it's not gonna work oh my god i can't i can't afford to mess it up so the second you you start adding because if something is big then the dimension of time enters right i can't you can eat healthy today you can 100 eat healthy today but you can't diet for 10 weeks like that's hard and so your mind is like oh it's hard to diet for 10 weeks so why bother eating healthy today if i can't do it for the full 10 weeks if i need my beach bod in 10 weeks time that's going to be hard so don't bother the second the dimension of time enters you're screwed and when what happens your mind is tricky it's sneaky right because what it looks at is looks like oh my god like imagine how many years it's going to take to put your life together and it may not even work and the mind is like eh don't bother it's not worth it right so the second time enters helplessness enters with it because then your mind says it's futile what's the point of eating healthy for one day and this is where detachment comes in because it doesn't matter because we're not worried about the outcome who cares about the outcome whether it succeeds or whether it fails i'm gonna eat healthy today it's the one thing i'm gonna do and your mind is like no no but don't do that what do you mean we care about the future no no no no you got to think about the future it's not going to be enough what do you mean we're like you're not going to give me a cheeseburger what the [ __ ] bro come on right koji korum is saying what's the point of smoking of not smoking a blunt exactly like why bother just smoke the blunt because what your mind wants is the blunt wants the cheeseburger wants the video games it wants that dopamine wants to relax wants to be numb wants those cannabinoids like whatever whatever you want it doesn't want to deal with those emotions that you've been bottling up and bearing inside you for a long time right because if you start to eat healthy today like the feelings of inadequacy come up the feelings of oh what do you think you're doing you think you're going to lose weight you ugly sucker right you look at yourself in the mirror and all the self-loathing comes up you have to deal with all that crap and it's like no we're gonna set all that crap aside i'm just gonna eat healthy today acid demon says that sort of hit home i had a guy tell me today that we weren't fit for for the long term after i told him i had anxiety and it was sort of getting to me but a lot of my anxiety comes from what i've dealt with yeah 100 so i think the other thing that you've got to be super careful about is assuming that his statement of we weren't fit for the long term is a response to i have anxiety because if you're not careful you're going to learn a bad lesson from that which will protect you because then if you don't tell people that you have anxiety maybe they won't say that which is the lesson that your mind will learn but then what's going to start happening is you're going to start not living authentically which is going to cause more problems down the right line so the hardest thing for someone with anxiety is giving someone the opportunity to reject them which you should absolutely be doing because once you give someone the opportunity to reject you you also give someone the opportunity to accept you and once you show people how busted you are and they stay anyway that's how you get fixed right that's when someone sends you that really important signal which is you matter and i don't care that you have anxiety you have intrinsic worth as a human being that your anxiety does not wipe away and the problem is that that's the message that like you really need to heal the other big challenge is that sometimes that message is most easily delivered from another person right which is what i'm saying is like we have a responsibility to each other to like try to support each other through this stuff because it's not like life is not a solo player game it's just not you
