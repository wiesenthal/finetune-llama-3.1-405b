kudos this seems like a very rigid set of rules yeah so it's rigid with y'all the cool thing is that when you do it properly is it going to feel rigid to other people yes which is what we want to do and you're not going to come across as crazy you're going to come across as understanding compassionate and firm it is rigid that's what people they don't we don't want to be doormats right like there's going to be some rigidity because at some point you're saying no and you're putting up a wall between their actions and what you're allowing that requires rigidity the question is how can we optimize that process for compliance on their part as well as maintaining the relationship so let's talk about setting boundaries so the tricky thing is that everyone sort of says hey like it's really important to set good boundaries men so i remember when i was in residency uh the residency program director at the time i i was kind of asking her you know what's one of the most useful things that you've learned that you wish you knew earlier and she was like the most useful skill i ever learned was learning how to say no and so you know you hear things like this right that learning to say no is is important it's important to like set healthy boundaries like set healthy boundaries around technology and set healthy boundaries with your parents and set healthy boundaries with your friends and set healthy boundaries with your significant other just like healthy boundaries man or woman but like no one ever teaches you like how do you set a boundary like how does that actually happen so today what we're going to talk about is like share with you all five important steps to setting a healthy boundary the first is actually articulating the boundary the second is how to implement the boundary the third is common pitfalls and this is something that i think is like grossly undereducated because setting a boundary is not easy right like actually maintaining it is not just about the other person it is oftentimes about you so yeah i i promise i will you know i'm gonna break up with this person and i'm never gonna see them again i'm gonna go no contact with them and let me text them two weeks from now when i'm feeling lonely on a friday night right so what are some of the pitfalls to setting boundaries and then like some in the moment tips it with enforcing boundaries so we can sort of say okay here's how you articulate a boundary here are the steps to implement it here are some things that you watch out for but in the moment when push comes to shove and you have to set a boundary with someone it can be very very hard right because you're afraid of particular things so how what is the right way to in the moment like lay out a boundary with someone enforce a boundary and the last thing that i think once again is not talked about is after you lay a boundary with someone after you enforce a boundary what do you do then right so like a big risk around boundary setting is that if you have friends or parents or or you know significant others and you set a boundary with them there's oftentimes like consequences to setting that boundary right so how do you manage those consequences because it's the fear of those consequences that oftentimes keeps us from setting the boundary in the first place or enforcing the boundary i don't like it when my friends make fun of me but if i say something to them they're just gonna make fun of me more or if i say something to them they're gonna think that i'm not fun to hang around with and i may not get invited next time right so like when you set boundaries with people sometimes there are consequences and so one of the things that i found is like a really really under taught skill is not just how to set a boundary but after you set a boundary how do you interact with the person to try to smooth things over and maintain a healthy relationship or hopefully repair whatever small rupture you have okay so let's dive in so step number one so at the end of this hopefully what you will be able to do is set a boundary like articulate a boundary implement a boundary troubleshoot some of the pitfalls get some like kind of coaching on in the moment what you should say or do when like push comes to shove and you really want to you know waver on your boundary and then the last thing that i think is really important is like at the end of this hopefully you'll have an idea of okay after i set a boundary and i feel guilty and like i'm afraid that people don't like me how do i interact with that person afterward to kind of patch things up and make sure that things are okay okay so step number one of boundary setting is articulating your boundary so this is where we basically figure out okay what specifically is our boundary and this is a a thing that i think is like you know you got to be careful about because if you want someone to adhere or respect a particular boundary it has to be like clearly laid out and the first problem that people run into is that they don't often times like clearly articulate what the boundary is and so if i sort of say like i want you to stop treating me this way it's like how does that person know what this way is right so like you're kind of setting them up to fail i don't like it when you talk to me like this so i'm not saying that those feelings aren't valid and they're absolutely there for a reason but if we're thinking about a relationship you need to be able to articulate it so that the other person understands what you mean okay so we're going to start by articulating boundaries second thing that we're going to do is how to implement boundaries third thing we're gonna do is pitfalls so what are some of the traps or things that you have to watch out for when it comes to boundary setting number four is in the moment tips right when when you are setting a boundary with your friend and they aggro and the boss music starts to play what do you do in that moment right how do you how do you manage the aggro of your friend and then last thing is after the encounter is over how do you repair the relationship so aftermath boundary setting okay so let's start with number one articulating a boundary so the first thing that i'd say is if you're trying to set boundaries with people okay there are a couple of key tips to understand the first is the earlier in the relationship the easier it is okay this is first thing to understand number two it's easier to loosen a boundary than it is to tighten it so this is part of the problem with like so people who are dealing with let's say entitled parents narcissistic parents entitled family members if you haven't set a boundary with them any kind of tightening that you do on the boundary is going to be met with a ton of resistance right whereas like if you're starting a relationship with someone you can sort of lay out what your boundaries are early on but if there's an expectation of behavior already in place running contrary to that expectation is going to encounter more resistance okay so what we want to do first of all is make the boundary very clear so this should be like actions that you articulate so i'll kind of give you all an example so let's say that you're talking to your parents and your parents have forbidden you to date because you are an asian or south asian person or many other cultures i suppose so no dating in middle school certainly not that's absurd no dating in high school no that's not something that our people do and in in college you should be focusing on studies and then like something happens where like your 25th birthday rolls around and then depending on your gender you may get a little bit of leeway one way or the other 25th birthday rolls around 26th birthday rolls around now it's like okay like now it's time to get married like why aren't you and then 27th birthday rolls around why aren't you married yet 28th birthday rolls around it's like what's wrong with you everyone else is getting married it would it would calm me down so much if you could just get married like don't you understand how much i worry about you and what's gonna happen about your future and now it's time beta now it's time now it's time beta it's time it's time it's time oh my goodness it's time so when you're sort of dealing with this the first thing that you have to do is clearly articulate what the boundary is so like you have to figure out okay because remember this is a behavior that you want someone else to do so the boundaries should be behavioral in nature it can't be like some kind of emotion that you they you want them to prevent like you don't want them to evoke an emotion like that's not a boundary you can set you can't they can't control how they make you feel they can only control what they say so you want your your boundary to be like very very clear and very behavioral in nature so for example for this person what i would recommend is when we talk on the phone don't ask about personal or romantic relationships right so like it doesn't mean it just this is the thing like when we talk on the phone right so i'm i'm assuming a couple things that you know you don't live with your parents or either not physically there with you or things like that and you can kind of say like hey like every time we talk on the phone like you keep on hammering me with the same stuff right you're always asking me when i'm going to get married i'll tell you when i have information going forward i would appreciate it if you did not ask me about this okay this is where you kind of want to like be very very clear about an ask now for people who have like very very pushy parents or very loose boundaries or things like that the other thing is remember that it's easier to loosen than it is to tighten so if we are implementing boundaries for people like remember this is that an overtime process so what you want to do it's longitudinal in nature so what you want to do is like you can't fix everything all at once and it's hard to ask people to make drastic adjustments overnight so what we're going to do is start by implementing a tiny tiny boundary right so this is where we are this is where we want to go we're not going to go like from here to here in one step we're going to go right here which they can manage and then we're going to go here and then we're going to go here and then we may take a bigger step right but generally speaking we want to tighten our boundaries very very gradually much like the way that i tighten my belt over my dad gut right so what we want to do is like be very very clear with a behavioral instruction okay second thing that we want to do is provide a very simple reason this is important we do not want to provide complex reasons we do not want to provide like intense reasons we do not want to provide justifications logic we do not want to provide scientific fact we do not want to talk to them about how they make us feel when they do that we want to provide a very very simple reason ideally one sentence of a reason so here's why when you provide complex reasons i don't want to go out with you because i'm not looking for a relationship okay that's option number one versus i don't date gamers i'm not looking for a relationship i'm celibate right now i have problems with my health the more reasons you provide the more justifications you provide the more argument you will invite so this is something that people like this is a very important thing to understand when you lay a boundary with someone it's not a discussion the more ammo and this is what one of the key drivers okay so when we lay out a boundary with someone we want them to understand because if they understand they won't push us the more they understand about me the more they understand about me the more they understand about me the easier it will be the less friction there will be the more they will see my perspective and the more they will respect me and then there won't be conflict so we tend to do is provide reasons to try to buy ourselves peace but in fact what it does is the exact opposite the more reasons we provide the more argument we we the more logic with more reasons and more stuff we sort of say to them it invites discussion right so what we want to do is ideally a very simple reason and like it can be like super simple right so it's something that you want to keep like not you don't want to justify in a way that sort of like invites argument or things like that if they really want to ask maybe you can answer a little bit more but generally speaking you can say hey when we talk on the phone i'd appreciate it like i i don't i don't find it helpful in fact it like makes it really hard for me to even think about this stuff and it makes me not want to engage with you when you ask me about my romantic relationships going forward when we talk on the phone i'd appreciate it if you didn't ask me about that okay so you want to make it just very very clear and that's where you listen to them we'll kind of getting ahead of ourselves here but generally speaking what we want to do when we articulate a boundary is make a clear behavioral thing uh like a clear behavioral thing an action that they can follow right as well as like sort of circumstances in which the boundary is like taking place so we want to think about when where and what in terms of our our boundary setting right when are we gonna enforce this no playing video games after 10 p.m on weekdays and it's not oh i'm so worried about your future i'm so worried you're gonna do this and oh so-and-so's son is doing this and all you ever do is play video games don't you understand i love you so much oh my god like i'm so worried about what's gonna happen you don't understand cause you're so young none of that crap if you're a parent we unfortunately i hate to break this to y'all twitch but we teach this to your parents too and it works wonders you lay a boundary with people it's like clearly articulated so no games after 10 pm period why because it's important that you focus on your school but i do focus on my school cool this is where with parents and stuff will sort of say like you know you need to maintain a particular gpa then we can talk about games on weekdays after 10 pm okay so very very simple you're right it's difficult jake we're going to help you through that that's where some of the pitfalls come in so you want to provide a very simple reason you want to make it nice and clear okay now this is how you define or articulate your boundary now we're going to move on to implementing a boundary okay some of the stuff we're going to talk about today is absolutely op critical mistakes that people make and how to avoid them okay first thing is that you lay the boundary without enforcing it at the same time this is important this is where a lot of people make the simplest mistake of boundaries if i'm limiting my child's gaming i am not going to tell them at 10 pm for the first time that i'm limiting their gaming after 10. i'm gonna tell them at 2 pm on a tuesday or 2 p.m on a saturday hey come this this monday starting this monday after 10 pm no more games so you don't want to tell lay the boundary you don't want to like explain to someone what the boundary is when you are emotional right and like when it's an active issue because what's going to happen is they are going to dismiss your concern because you're going to be like they're going to be pissed right they're going to dismiss your concern because like you're active like then and there people don't like boundaries they don't like laying out a boundary while it's being enforced so the way that i i want you to think about it is like you know getting arrested for something that you know is breaking the law is very different from getting punished for something that you were not aware of so someone walks up to you and like that's against the rules i'm gonna take your backpack away you're like wait what like i didn't know that was against the rules no one ever explained that to me like i was not aware of this so in that same way we want to give people a chance ahead of time to understand what the boundary is because the other important thing is that if your parents are asking you for example about your romantic life they want to know in that moment so it is going to feel really really punitive and it's going to cost them something additional if you lay a boundary and enforce it so we want to separate those two things out we want people to have a lot of advanced notice about the boundary before we enforce it that way when we enforce it it's kind of tricky i don't know if this sort of makes sense but if you lay a boundary and enforce it at the same time you're going to get a lot more pushback because they want to know in that moment what's going on in your romantic life right that curiosity or that desire that anxiety is there it's going to be hard for them to respect it but when y'all are like let's say you're going out with your parents for grocery shopping at noon on a saturday and y'all are going out grocery shopping you're saying hey like while you're in the car you kind of say hey like there's something i wanted to let you all know i know that you guys are concerned we'll talk about this as well about my romantic situation and things like that i appreciate your concern i just want to let you all know that whenever we talk whenever you ask me on the phone it really makes me like very upset and not want to talk to you so going forward i'm not going to really participate in any conversations about my romantic life on the phone so you want to give them advance notice this is key okay that's going to make it easier for them to digest remember laying the boundary and enforcing the boundary is going from here to here at the same time this is the conversation two days before right and then enforcement is gonna be this don't worry we'll get here we're just gonna do it slow okay so step number one tip number one lay the boundary and enforce the boundaries separately give them advance notice okay tip number two for implementing a boundary acknowledge their perspective once again we're having this conversation ahead of time right so they're not you're not pissed off in this moment but you want to acknowledge their perspective they will be much more likely to adhere to your boundaries if you acknowledge their perspective that does not mean that you necessarily agree with it or that you have to cede to it but you want to demonstrate to them you know like because when you lay a boundary with someone you want to demonstrate to them that you understand so when you lay a boundary with someone here's me here's the boundary here's the person i have a relationship with one of the most common counter arguments is they don't understand oh beta you don't understand you are getting old now you don't understand it's going to be hard things have to be done in their own time right like oh you don't understand so what you want to do is you want to sort of deflate that by expressing your understanding ahead of time and since it's not an argument since they have nothing to lose they're not going to like argue with you there right so what you want to do is ahead of time acknowledge their perspective so you can say hey i understand that you know things should be done in a particular time and that now that i'm 28 it's really you feel like it's really important that i get married can you help me understand a little bit about why it's so important to be married at 28 as opposed to 26 or 30 like what changes so you can ask a question or two right so we're going to use some good old hg conversational techniques okay you can learn this from watching what we do on stream and how we ask questions as we can also kind of this these are things that we explicitly teach in group coaching right so you can ask questions and remember this is not when you're enforcing a boundary so it's a peaceful conversation okay i understand so it's about kids yeah i understand so when i have my newborn pictures it looks bad if i'm bald gotcha mom i'm with you there's kids there's this there's that there's you know things need to be done in their own time or if they can't give you a good answer which i know is crazy but is oftentimes going to be is going to happen and they can't give you a concrete answer they just think that it should be done at that time because that's culturally what they believe you can say i'm not really hearing a clear reason but it's clear to me that you feel very strongly about this and that it's very important to you and then like when you say things like that they can't say this okay oh sorry i can't see that all right so you acknowledge their perspective that's going to be really important okay next thing you can do is clarify their understanding this also is going to reduce the tension when it comes to enforcement so what does clarify their understanding mean that means asking them what they understood about your boundary so step number one we're gonna say when we talk about when we talk on the phone i don't want you to ask about personal or romantic relationships can you help me understand why it's so important i get married now then what you're going to do is say okay so i just want to make sure we're on the same page what did you understand about what i want to talk about on the phone and what i want to avoid talking about on the phone so you want to ask them just make sure we're on the same page so just like so you know what did you understand like what are my preferences about what's off limits on the phone and then they'll say like okay you don't want to talk about manage okay okay great cool okay then what you want to do is offer them anticipatory consequences just so you know mom i'm so glad that you understood and heard me that you don't i don't want to talk about marriage every time we talk on the phone that really means a lot to me if in the future you decide to ask me just understand that i'm going to go ahead and like politely hang up i'm not going to like hang up on you but i'll sort of let you know hey mom i'll remind you i'll say hey remember when i said i don't want to talk on the phone and then like i'm just going to step away from the conversation right so you want to let people know what the consequences are so hey son it's saturday at noon noon starting tomorrow starting this week at 10 p.m no gaming after weekdays until you have a 3.5 gpa okay and then you they're kind of like uh okay whatever because they're not playing then right it's like you're not enforcing the limit so you're not going to encounter game rage by the way if you're playing after 10 p.m no games for the next 48 hours or no games for the rest of the week just so you understand okay you didn't understand okay what are we starting next week i did things kind of out of order what are we what's the rule we're starting what did you understand about what i said okay no games after 10 pm okay cool i'm glad we're on the same page by the way if you do play games after 10 pm you're gonna on a weekday if i if you end up doing that you're i'm gonna go ahead and take away the game for the rest of the week okay so you want to lay out anticipatory like consequences ahead of time so once again the goal here is to lay this stuff out outside of the conflict okay no games for 24 hours no games for the rest of the week you can do whatever anticipatory consequences you want right especially if you're a parent so this is really really important implementing a boundary let's kind of recap so once we've articulated it that's not enough there are all all these important elements to implementing the boundary that we have articulated we've figured out the what when how right where we figured out we don't want to get into a bunch of reasoning but we also want a couple of these steps when laying out the boundary the first is that we don't want to lay it while we're enforcing it we need to separate that emotion and conflict from enforcement from the kind of intellectual discussion and notifying people right it's sort of like when you get these notifications by the way your bill is due on the 30th by the way your bill is seven days past due by the way in two weeks if we don't hear from you we're to send you to collections this is very very effective in terms of behaviorally sort of letting people know what the consequences are to get them to comply with particular behavior so we want to lay out the boundary ahead of time when no one is emotionally active second thing is we want to acknowledge their perspective right so we want to say it's not about it's not i understand that you have feelings you have goals i respect those goals it's just i can't do this on the phone we can talk about it in person that's fine but we're i just can't do it on the phone clarify their understanding you want to make sure that it's actually sinking in because for a lot of people when you lay a boundary like they're not gonna it's gonna kind of go in one ear and out the other so you wanna clarify their understanding what did you understand about this if they don't understand you can say it again you can repeat it and then you can ask them right away it's gonna kind of feel like sort of artificial or maybe even make them feel stupid but that's okay right so you just wanna hey i understand i know it's weird that i'm sort of asking you to like again and again but like i just want to make sure that i'm communicating clearly you can just say something like that okay this is important to me and then you want to offer anticipatory consequences so hey if you do this this is what i'm going to do so get ready for it because you're probably going to do it okay that's how you implement now as you go to implement a boundary what will happen is you will screw it up right because this is hard and even you can sort of say i'd love to implement this boundary but this is where like as a human being you have all kind of thoughts goals emotions relationships ego you have all this crap floating around in your head and that's not all aligned right oh i want to study but damn do i really want to play elden ring i really really don't want to hear about i don't want my mom to ask me about marriage but internally i'm terrified and when i hear her speak the terror that is in my heart it feels like emotionally satisfying in a bizarre way it's kind of like when i'm doom-scrolling after i get dumped and i'm stalking my ex on social media does it feel bad yeah is it addictive hell yeah right so there are weird internal things that are going on in our body in our mind that cause us to screw up the boundaries that we try to set so pitfall number one okay we kind of talked about this but avoid lengthy explanations so oftentimes when it comes to enforcing a boundary we want to have long conversations about it we want to justify hey i'm not crazy that i'm doing this like here are all the reasons why like please try to understand this is hurtful for me and pay attention to me and understand me understand me understand me so don't be mad don't be mad at me this is a powerful emotional driver when you lay a boundary with someone this emotional driver is the single biggest driver to why people screw up their boundaries because they don't want people to be mad at them okay so just avoid the lengthy explanations avoid justifications why is this shouldn't you explain yourself it's kind of like simple behavioral stuff where oftentimes if you look at like if you take 100 people who provide lengthy explanations and justifications and people who don't provide lengthy explanations and justifications people who don't provide lengthy explanations and justifications are just more successful at setting boundaries and having other people adhere to them so you want to be like simple because once you have a two-hour conversation about feelings like what was that simply articulated thing that you were supposed to do like i don't even remember because now we had this deep heart to heart where like we understand each other so much better now sometimes that can be useful we'll talk about when and how to have that heart tart those are important but you don't want to you want to avoid lengthy explanations especially at the time of enforcement in enforcement it's about behavior not explanation or justification okay next stop okay so uh next up is oh yeah this is huge prepare for the consequences okay so now this is really tricky but when you set a boundary with someone they're going to be consequences for you too right this is something that you really really need to understand so oftentimes the reason that we don't succeed in laying out boundaries is because we don't really like prepare for the consequences and the consequences are so emotionally painful that we end up giving up on our boundary and this has a devastating effect so when i lay a boundary and i don't enforce it what am i entraining the other person to do what is the lesson they are learning think about this for a second yep very good my boundaries can be safely ignored what you are actually training this person to do is disrespect your boundaries it's the exact opposite so don't lay a boundary unless you are prepared to deal with the consequences this is part of the other thing that's very important about how we set boundaries this is why we don't want to go here because the consequences for this are large the consequences for this are usually small and essentially what we want to do is we want people to understand that once i lay a boundary this is the hill i'm going to die on and this is where you just want to make the consequences like relatively small for them so even in this situation you know having been this is close to home but when you know parents are like oh beta when are you going to get married we're not saying you can't ever ask me about marriage that's too difficult for your parents to handle so it's just when we talk on the phone and when i when we go when we go get groceries when we go out to eat you can bombard me you don't want to say that but you want to give them a place to bombard you and then eventually what we're going to do is tighten that boundary right so you can say like hey i understand that this is important to y'all i really appreciate that we're not talking about it on the phone can we go out to dinner like when we go out to dinner i just want to enjoy spending time with you i don't want to think about this stuff i understand you're worried we can like talk about it like once a month like i'll come over on a weekend and we can just have one discussion about it i'm not saying that i'm i want to shut you down completely but when we go out to dinner i don't want to talk about this at all okay so you have to be prepared for the consequences first of all they could be emotionally painful second thing to really think about is that people may treat you differently right so you may not get invited to that party your friends may not ask you to queue up with them if you lay a boundary it's possible so you have to mentally be prepared for that and the main thing here is that you have to really anticipate the consequence so that you know it's coming if you know it's coming much like this if you have anticipatory consequences you yourself will be able to handle it emotionally better this is just like a general aspect of human psychology where if human beings know something is coming they are better able to deal with it it is the expectation of no boundary followed by the arbitrary setting of a boundary that is infuriating to deal with and if you all have had controlling parents you know exactly what i mean here where there are some people that like it's like you just suddenly get 15 phone calls between 9 15 and 9 45 where your parents are like where are you where are you where are you why aren't you home yet why aren't you answering your phone the reason you have a phone is to answer our calls and you're like where on earth is this coming from they're like you know you're supposed to be home by nine and you're like what are you talking about we've never had this conversation before it's infuriating or the parent who comes into your room and is like why aren't you going to bed yet you have school tomorrow i don't want to unplug that video game right now if you don't employ i'm going to throw away a computer you see this hammer i'm gonna smash your playstation and it's like there's no anticipation whereas if someone kind of tells you hey by the way this is gonna happen at this time we're gonna shut off the internet right that's dad by the way not mom come on heteronormative chat right so prepare for the consequences understand that like emotionally it could be painful maybe i'll be a little bit lonely maybe my parents will guilt-trip me oh beta don't you understand your mother worries so much betta bhagwan do you want to be a good son then let me tell you how you need to get married four years ago you want to be good son but i think about your bar your grandmother is in india and she is stressed so much she has diabetes and her blood sugar is bad because you have not gotten married think about your ba the guilt trip may happen right so be prepared for it and it could be little things right so if you set a boundary with your gaming friends they may like invite you less or like they may like be dming you behind your back or other kinds of petty crap we'll talk about that in a second okay so you got to think about consequences right so prepare for them understand that it's going to be tough the good news a little reassurance here is that human beings tend to be creatures of habit and if you set a small boundary with someone chances are they're not going to rupture the entire relationship and this is where like if they're going to rupture the entire relationship because you set a small boundary with them that's something you need to understand because this is not a relationship you can like win in right when they're willing to go nuclear every time you like you know try to lay a boundary with them about taking out the trash like this is not a healthy relationship that you can win like because you know a healthy relationship requires two people to be contributing okay third thing is be aware that we sort of talked about this a little bit but be aware of the emotional drivers to compromising your boundaries so number one reason that you give up on your boundaries it's not even the other person you give up on your boundaries is because of some kind of usual emotional driver so like what is your weakness what do you have low amounts of resistance to do you have guilt resistance do you have what if they don't like me what if you have let me think about this loneliness vulnerability i would rather be bullied than be alone right so and this is where you got to do some some work because like this is important because what you don't want to do is set a hypothetical boundary that you wish were true and that you wish you could enforce if you can't enforce it so you need to think about this first and you have to really think about what am i willing to actually enforce and that's the boundary that you should set okay and like unless you because otherwise what you're actually doing if you like if you optimistically set a boundary it's like i'm going to a wedding and let me buy uh let me get my tux or my dress or whatever tailored to be like two sizes too small because that's gonna be motivation for me to like lose weight because now i'm locked in don't do that kind of crap you're just gonna end up looking bad being uncomfortable some people will succeed it works for some people when it comes to boundaries like don't do that set boundaries that you can enforce because if you can win this one then you can win this one and then you can win this one and then you can win this one and then you can win this one this is what you want to do okay gradual so think a little bit about okay how am i gonna feel and when i feel that way what am i gonna wanna do okay i broke up with this person i'm gonna block them and be prepared for the feeling of loneliness that hits two weeks out because we're on again off again this has been going on for three years we've broken up six times so when you sort of do that be prepared for that and be like okay so like am i gonna be able to resist in two weeks well i need to resist that's not the question are you gonna be able to what can you do to help you resist okay so like it sounds like every friday night when the loneliness hits like i'm gonna i'm gonna start playing lost ark and we're gonna schedule raids so i'm gonna be like busy during those times or i'm gonna turn off my phone and i'm gonna put it in the different room and i'm gonna like watch movies or whatever so you have to think about your own emotional drivers and kind of work on those okay now when it comes to in the moment so now we've sort of thought through your emotional drivers we've thought about the consequences of laying a boundary you've articulated things you've sort of you know given them anticipatory consequences and you lay a boundary so how do you actually in the moment tell someone that you are enforcing a boundary like what do you say like in that moment right so this is also something that we don't i don't see this anywhere i like i even did a google search for like boundary setting in preparation for this and i just saw like all this generic crap about like learn to say no like okay how like why can't people say no like there's no so this is detailed okay so first thing is you state the boundary like state it like literally hey mom you remember what when we talked about how like we're not supposed to your you agreed not to uh ask me about like marriage stuff over the phone i asked you to not ask me about that and you are asking me about that now okay so this is the key thing if you can you want to remind people of the prior conversation right so you can kind of these are is like very short this is like five seconds this is five seconds these are not long conversations mom do you remember when we talked about how you're not supposed to ask me about marriage okay and then don't get bogged down in justification if they're like no i don't remember or i uh be good they're trying to engage you with discussion no but like things have changed like that was different i didn't realize you were talking about this i didn't know i forgot no it's really important like this is different like people were going to respond to you with some kind of like engagement with conversation okay so they will try to engage with you either they will dispute the conversation in bad scenarios they may try to gaslight you but i think that word gets thrown around a lot chances are they'll justify their actions so be prepared for justifications disputes arguments all that kind of stuff so we don't want to get into that no explanations they can say you just want to listen to what they're going to say and then you can say okay i you can acknowledge if you want to here okay i understand that you think that this scenario is different and then what you want to do is consequence so you're going to say hey i i oh i'm so sorry i'm so sorry you can say okay good i'm glad you're sorry it seems like you understand i'm still gonna step away from the conversation this is this is critical okay i want y'all to understand this no games after 10 pm 11 pm rolls around and someone is playing games remind of the boundary kid says i'm sorry it won't happen again critical juncture what does the parent do now what does the parent do now no games this week you enforce the consequence mom i'm so glad you understand i'm gonna go ahead and hang up no no no no no but i i said i'm sorry good i'm really glad you understand that you know you made a mistake that means a lot to me bye i'll give you a call tomorrow right so you want to kind of acknowledge their perspective if they did apologize great i'm glad you understand enforce okay this is how people get like manipulated so if you're vulnerable to manipulation what tends to happen is you lay a boundary they say i'm sorry you don't enforce and what are you teaching the person that i'm sorry is a substitute for respecting my boundaries this is literally what you're behaviorally training the person to do you're teaching them just apologize and you can continue violating my boundaries i'm so glad that you feel bad about taking advantage of me and turning me into a doormat let me lay down on the floor so that you could walk all over me just make sure you apologize as you're doing that because that then everything will be okay okay this is important so once the boundaries cross the boundaries cross you can acknowledge it but it's enforced okay i'm glad you understand so hopefully next time this happens like you know next time we talk on the phone i i really hope that you remember this goodbye now last thing but does this mean that everyone will hate me the aftermath of boundary setting okay so first thing to understand is that relationships must grow your relationship cannot stay static over time it is just not the nature of relationships so if we think about friendship if we think about marriage if we think about you know the parent-child relationship right so my relationship with my parents when i'm two is different from what it is when i'm 10 is different from what it is when i'm 20 and is different from what it is when i'm 30 and 35 right like that is a natural part of things my marriage was when i first started dating my girlfriend our relationship was one thing then we were officially dating then we became engaged then we got married then we were like married prior to kids and then we're married with kids and these are all different things like the relationship must change over time relationships have to grow just like human beings do nothing is static so what the key thing to understand about boundary setting is that a lot of times we feel guilty for ruining the relationship whereas like it's okay to feel guilty right maybe you are ruining an aspect of the relationship i know it sounds weird to say but sometimes aspects of relationships need to be ruined in order for the relationship to grow you can't just keep doing things the way that you used to as relationships change so what you can always do once again this is separate from the enforcement so there's enforcement conversation and then like you know 24 to 96 hours later there's a feedback conversation so this is where you should like actively reach out to the person and say you know so give your mom a call the next day and say hey mom how are you what did you think i know i stepped off the phone yesterday what was that like for you so just ask them for feedback what was that like for you okay i'm glad we're talking you know are you okay with what i did or did you feel hurt can you tell me a little bit about that you don't have to change your boundary but you can ask to understand their perspective because this is where sometimes people get on this boundary setting like high where they start just like laying boundaries man people don't respect my boundaries like if they don't respect me i'm not going to respect them and that's how you turn and turn into an [ __ ] in a relationship so it's important to lay boundaries it's also important to understand that some of your boundaries may be i know it's shocking oh my goodness some of your boundaries may be unreasonable right it's like i don't want to talk about the dishes what it's like bro we're roommates and you don't do your [ __ ] dishes i understand that it makes you upset but like are you gonna do the dishes right so there's there's a different person involved in this relationship so you have to like engage with that person in the aftermath if you want to develop a healthy relationship so you have to ask them hey what was that like for you okay ask for feedback so next thing to understand is that remember that boundary setting is one step at a time so this is something you can gradually do over time but generally speaking you want to like maintain the relationship with them by asking for feedback by the way asking for feedback is also uh actually let me move this around a little bit so before we do this one actually what we're going to do is express feedback so ask for feedback first and then express feedback so this is where you can even express gratitude huge for repairing the relationship hey mom i know that i set a limit yesterday on our conversation i'm really really glad and happy that you didn't like call me immediately afterward and that like you answered my phone today i ca i imagine that you must be or since you've already asked them i know that you're feeling upset about that and i'm really grateful that you're like you know choosing to respect my boundary here it means a lot to me it makes it so much easier for me to call you and i really hope that we can talk about this because i was noticing that because you keep asking about this i felt like i didn't even want to talk to you i stopped answering your calls and that's not the kind of relationship i want with you so thank you so much for respecting my boundary it's hard for people to be pissed at you when you say things like that right and if they're still going to be pissed at you they're like screw you and then like that's someone that you may not like that's like a toxic person that you may want to be super careful about letting into your life right so you may want to set limits with them whereas if they're reasonable people who are willing for their relationship to grow like this is all going to be good stuff so oddly enough after you enforce a boundary expressing gratitude is a huge way to patch things up okay and then last thing is process your emotions huge externally huge huge huge so all this crap is gonna leave you with emotions this is gonna be the result of emotions these kinds of like justifications and things like that right like all these complex reasons that we give people are due to our own emotions expressing gratitude is going to be really really hard towards your parents if you were so pissed at them for bringing it up i told you i didn't want you to do it and you did it anyway and i feel so hurt which is fine that you feel that way but you don't want to bring that up with them so here's the key thing about like setting a boundary in summary you want to be calm cool collected when setting when enforcing and when doing debriefing afterwards if you get messed up in the head like everything is going to get way harder okay because you want to make keep it like nice and clean like we want boundaries to be clean clean clean so in order for you to be calm cool and collected you need to take your emotions somewhere else vent to a third party talk to a friend on discord talk to a therapist go to your group and talk to your group about hey i'm working let's all set boundaries like let's work on boundaries together okay this is what we're gonna do this week in group pick a person set a boundary let's all articulate the boundary ahead of time okay what's your boundary what's my boundary what's but okay that sounds too complicated that sounds like it's not going to work well okay what are the anticipated problems that you're going to feel emotionally when you try to set a boundary what are we going to what are the consequences that you can expect that we're going to think through all these things together so that we're prepared for them okay let's go do our homework lay that boundary don't enforce it have a conversation ahead of time go do this thing okay and then like when you come in the next week in group like it's gonna be a mess right because everyone will have screwed up because this is a skill just like anything else and then when everyone in group sort of struggles with it then you guys are gonna we're y'all are gonna work together and hopefully like process your emotions and then you're gonna try it again okay so to summarize issue number one healthy boundaries are important yet no one teaches us how to set boundaries setting boundaries is a lot more than telling people what you want them to do if you want to successfully set a boundary you have to make it easy for them to manage how do you make it easy for them to manage you articulate it clearly number one you don't provide a whole lot of reasons justifications complexity because that just invites argument and invites discussion and then we lose sight of the boundary second thing to understand is once we have an articulated boundary we want to really separate out when we inform people of the boundary and when we enforce the boundary boundary enforcement is filled with emotion filled with people getting hurt and filled with like people getting upset with each other because a big reason that we tend to forgo our own boundaries is to maintain relationships so we want to remove that emotion from the equation by setting the boundary ahead of time letting people know there are a lot of pitfalls we have to watch out for sometimes the biggest pitfall is ourself we don't want to feel guilty we don't want to feel bad we don't want to deal with the consequences so we end up not enforcing the boundary which in turn entrains the exact opposite behavior which is you're just teaching people hey my boundaries don't need to be respected because i'm not going to do anything to you if you don't respect them so you can just ignore what i say okay there are lots of common pitfalls that we run into engaging in arguments stuff like that next thing is when it comes down to the actual enforcement of a boundary state it clearly these don't need to be long conversations they don't want to be complicated kinds of things we want to separate out enforcement from debriefing and aftermath of a boundary setting so just say hey remind people of the boundary remind people of the conversation acknowledge their perspective in force and get the hell out of the conversation as quickly as possible right so what you want people to experience is the behavioral consequence as opposed to like you said this and i can't believe that you did this and oh i feel so hurt and like oh my god and then you guys like talk for an hour you kind of patch things up it feels great right oh you've like strengthened your relationship i understand you so much better now oh my god i understand you so much better now and what happens next got to be careful sometimes that leads to positive behavioral change sometimes it does not so by all means have that conversation but separate it out from the enforcement so that conversation is important that's where we get to the debrief what should you do afterward talk to the person express gratitude try to understand their perspective maybe explain a little bit of your own right oh i understand that you're sorry and you you didn't realize that you were keeping track of time okay so it sounds like you know going forward you're going to be able to keep better track of time so starting next week it shouldn't be a problem but what about this week i said i learned my lesson good i'm really glad so it shouldn't be a problem next week but my friends are raiding tonight okay what do you mean okay does that mean i get to play no we talked about no games after 10 p.m and you played till 11 and we discussed the consequence of no gaming this week so you can raid with your friends next week but i'm going to miss out on loot okay well you'll miss out on loot and it's like that's you know they can say and this is where like oh lude isn't important you gotta think about what's important in life like don't get distracted all that crap right so you want to hear their perspective okay i understand that rating is important to you it seems like this is a really important deal that you're missing out on writing i hadn't realized that now that you realize it can i play no right so maybe you want to reconsider but generally speaking enforcement is enforcement then you ask for feedback you know you can express gratitude you can acknowledge what people have kind of done for you and if you're pissed like decompress those emotions elsewhere for now okay and that's how we set boundaries questions kudos this seems like a very rigid set of rules yeah so it's rigid with y'all the cool thing is that when you do it properly is it going to feel rigid to other people yes which is what we want to do and you're not going to come across as crazy you're going to come across as understanding compassionate and firm that's what we want with boundary setting right i understand what you're saying okay so like this is still going to be good that's totally fine like it is rigid that's what people they don't we don't want to be doormats right and that's where like the more that you have conversations the more that you understand their perspective like there's going to be some rigidity because at some point you're saying no and you're putting up a wall between their actions and what you're allowing that requires rigidity the question is how can we optimize that process for compliance on their part as well as maintaining the relationship someone's asking i've never set boundaries with my friends or family should i do it do you need to that's for you to figure out this is a how not whether you should because what i hear far too often is like i need to learn how to set boundaries i have terrible boundaries we see this all the time i have terrible boundaries okay so like what are we gonna do about that right like everyone's like oh my god i have terrible boundaries people don't respect my boundaries okay like what are we gonna do about it like how love yourself more like just learn how to say no like it doesn't work like this is not just learn how to say no there's like lots of steps and there's a reason why we have all those steps each of these steps will mitigate the damage mitigate the emotions hopefully salvage the relationship as best as you can the other thing is that when you do this kind of stuff like you know if people are reacting very very badly to it that's why we ask for feedback and this is not like ask for feedback and ignore what they say like really pay attention to them because you may be bad at setting boundaries and if this is the other thing to understand is that sometimes you sort of need like a friend transplant like a friend group transplant because if you're with a group of people who really does not like boundaries being set on them and you start enforcing boundaries you may have to gravitate towards people who are like will respect boundaries and maybe your entire friend's circle won't so that can sometimes happen are boundaries ever worth being challenged or is that toxic of course they're worth being challenged because who says that the boundary that you set is not toxic to begin with right so i have a boundary that i'm never going to take out the trash that's my boundary i need you to respect that it's like that's not fair to me right so this is a relationship has mutual elements this is something that i see a lot especially on the internet and someone will frame a problem a particular way like oh like so and so like they're not respecting like you frame because it's like you're biased right so you ask the internet for advice the internet is like pitchforks pitchforks pitchforks screw that person they're not respecting your boundaries whereas like you you know the internet doesn't ask questions like okay like when they've when they try to respect your boundaries how do you sabotage them which happens a lot right we self-sabotage when it comes to boundaries like maybe you should work on that a boundary is not just because you set a boundary does not make it objectively correct so be reflective how to set a boundary with yourself to not make myself suffer coming up coolest harold so what if one part of us feels like setting boundaries isn't a good idea that's completely normal the reason that boundaries are so hard to set is because there's almost always a part of you that doesn't think it's a good idea that's why they're so freaking hard to set like why do you think it's so hard it's not because of other people it's because of you like the reason we're bad at setting boundaries is because of our own emotional needs i don't want people to dislike me i don't want people to be mad at me it's gonna be mom and dad are gonna make a real mess of things if i set a boundary with them my friends won't invite me over if i set a boundary with them there's always going to be a part of you that does not want to set a boundary now this is where it's not like absolutely correct that you should listen to that or absolutely correct that you should ignore it all the time like that's not what the scope of this conversation is that's what you have to figure out like where is the dividing line what is an okay amount of boundary to set with people and understand that some people may not like it which is completely normal yeah so someone's saying i try to set boundaries and they still do the said thing that's where i'd ask you what are the consequences when someone violates their boundary what are the consequences if there aren't consequences people aren't going to respect your boundaries and you're like but i don't have the ability to set consequences okay well that's different so if you're like a 14 year old and you're under the control of your narcissistic entitled parents you may not be able to set a boundary with them that's unfortunate but it could be true and if that's the case that's where it's like you just got to buy your time and time is on your side because eventually you'll become independent and then you can set whatever boundaries you want to and that's when they're going to say i'm sorry and that's when you're going to say i'm i'm happy to hear you say that and i'm not inviting you to my wedding right good i'm very happy to hear you say that but i said i'm sorry yeah i understand that thank you so much for saying that but we want to come well it's like the psychological damage that you've done over me to me over the past 15 years can't be wiped away with two words and maybe you know i'm i'm happy that you said you're sorry i'm happy to try to patch things up for you but i don't think that's gonna happen within three months and i want my wedding to be a day where i can be like happy and full free of stress and generally speaking that has not been my experience with you does that hurt is it an oof yes and it's okay to say that right you can acknowledge you can say like because here's the thing when they say i'm sorry and you say okay all is forgiven come to the wedding what are they going to do at the wedding exactly what they've done for the last 15 years right it's the fact that they say you're sorry and you compromise your boundaries that gets you in this situation in the first place so and some people may be like oh my god this guy's such a rigid [ __ ] it's like okay i mean i really don't think so but i've been pushed to this do you does that make sense to you i've tried everything else over the last 15 years and it doesn't seem to be working so this is the best i can come up with what if it's unfixable after the wedding then it's unfixable after the wedding right so the only the only reason that things are unfixable is when one party decides that they're unfixable otherwise you can keep working at it right a relationship can keep on improving as long as both parties are trying and if they feel so hurt that they are willing to sever their relationship with you because you did not invite them to their wedding and they miss this milestone of your life and they're willing to end the relationship that is exactly why you're not inviting them to the wedding it is the consequence of we will never talk to you again if we don't come to the wedding it is that thought that they have planted in your head which is exactly why you need to set a boundary with them does that make sense so this is it's a beautiful sentence what if they never talk to you again that's like exactly what i'm saying man like look at this or a woman i don't know um so this is the emotional drives compromising your bound boundaries guilt what if they don't like me that's how they that's how they propagate right that's how people take advantage of you is because there are powerful emotional drivers what if my parents never talk to me again right you can like that's where like you do your dharma so you they say like oh like you know they're maybe they'll say if you if you don't invite us to our wedding we're never talking to you again and that's where you can say like yeah this is exactly why i don't want you there because anytime i try to set a limit with you you just resort to emotional blackmail you're threatening me with destroying a relationship when i'm setting a limit with you this is exactly why i don't want you at my wedding does that make sense to you what but but no but it's such an important occasion then you don't want to get down the important occasion round okay yeah i understand it's an important occasion that's why you know and then like you know when christmas rolls around or when it's their birthday or whatever they they may say we never want to talk to you again you can still call them you can still send them a card and they get to rebuff you over and over again and each time that you reach out the hand of peace and they swat it away you can rest easy at night knowing that you've done your job and that this is a truly unreasonable person so this is where like you know for three years on their birthday you call them and you send them cards and they don't answer they send your cards back and then they find out then you stop sending cards and they find out through social media that you have a kid they'd love to meet their grandson what do you say at that point right you can i wouldn't recommend being punitive but you can sort of like for three years i sent you all birthday cards and called you and you didn't want any kind of relationship with me help me understand what's changed well now we have a grandson okay so like so i'm hearing that you don't want a relationship with me you want a relationship with my son well no we want a relationship with you too then why didn't you ever pick up my why don't you ever answer the phone well because it was hard for us okay well i i'd really appreciate if you could think through that and and help me understand what's going on because so far what i'm seeing is that when there's something in it for you you answer the phone i'm not seeing that you're demonstrating that like what i want out of this relationship is important at all well what do you want out of the relationship i wanted some kind of contact over the last three years well okay well we'll we'll fix it going forward but why wasn't it fixed before i want to understand this like i'm not saying i want contact going forward i've let go of that i tried for three years to build a relationship with you and was rebuffed what i wanted was you to answer the phone three years ago well i can't do that okay so then what are you expecting from me at this point got to teach people that their actions have consequences thanks for the gifted subs should we move on right so this is where like you don't want to be mean so this is where like saying those kinds of things seems harsh but it's not like i hate you you're a terrible parent you don't want to ever say i mean you can imply those things if you want to but you yourself should like let go of that crap does that make sense you can say like yeah i understand that you want but like you just state to them like i i don't hear from you for five years and now that you have a grandson suddenly you're reaching out like i'm so confused over the last five years you've given me every indication that you do not want a relationship and now i'm concerned about like this kind of person letting this kind of person into my son's life because what i'm seeing from you is that when you want something you pick up the phone but when i want something you don't answer and i'm not interested in having someone like that be a central part of my my son's life does that make sense to you but blah blah blah okay i i heard what you said but did you hear what i said does it make sense to you that i would not want someone when i need something and i call that person they don't answer the phone and when they want something they pick up the phone and call them or call call me when they need something do you understand remember we're asking for understanding why i would not that want that kind of person is part of my son's life well but but but but okay so they say they dis-emulate again right so you can say okay so this is part of the problem is that i've said something to you twice and i'm not hearing you acknowledge it at all so i'm going to go ahead and hang up now in order for this to work you need to be able to acknowledge and understand my perspective which is exactly what i think the problem has been thus far goodbye if these if my parents learn these techniques i'm done for you're damn right you are we're teaching it to them because here's the thing generally speaking when parents learn their tech these techniques the kids hate it for like three months and then their life starts getting better and then they're grateful sorry but yeah so at this point it's irreversible no it's not irreversible but like they need to acknowledge right it's not irreversible but it's like unless they're gonna make some acknowledgment of what you've done been through and demonstrate some kind of understanding then like you're just signing yourself up for more of the same so this is the kind of thing where if y'all are stuck in life chances are it's because you're it's not because your parents were too harsh chances are they did a bad job of setting boundaries on you and for those of you say my parents were super controlling super controlling is not the same as setting boundaries this is important to understand so like being super controlling is usually about arbitrary boundary enforcement if you think your parents were like set to i mean like does that make sense your parents didn't do the crap that i was telling this is good parenting this is how you set up a boundary with a child you let them know what's coming you give them an opportunity to act in the right way you give them ample opportunity to act in the right way you make sure everyone is on the same page you make sure they understand you ask them for feedback even as a parent what do you think about that i think that one week was way too harsh and that's when you can say okay fine so if you think it was too harsh it sounds like you're adhering now so if you step if you make a mistake again it'll be like three days how does that sound to you and that's when the kid is like stuck because it's like you're you're moving in the right direction so do they throw it in your face and say no you're like okay or do they like they do they take the win do they take the w and build a relationship with you and do you demonstrate to them or do they choose to be pissed no it doesn't matter okay well let me know if you change your mind and then they they step over the line again if you want to be like a good parent then what you do is hey you remember last time when i asked you you make a mistake again are we gonna ban it for a week are we gonna ban it for three days and you said it doesn't matter i'm curious which one should we do this time and then the kid is like what's your angle my angle is that i'm your parent and i love you and i i want you to do well in school but i don't want to harshly punish you and you said that last time it was harsh punishment and then when i asked you about three days like you didn't seem to care so i'm asking you again like which one do you think is more appropriate like three days it's like okay cool so if you screw up on thursday or friday because today's monday then we're probably gonna have to push out to a week but if you can manage thursday and friday fine in your final next week like three days seems more appropriate what do you think like so setting healthy boundaries is like really good for kids it's how you learn how to regulate yourself so many of the problems in our communities because parents haven't set healthy boundaries on you they haven't taught you how to set healthy boundaries which is why you don't teach the you don't set them with other people you all get that right so like and that's why like no one teaches us this stuff parents no one teaches parents this stuff it's not their fault we're not saying that parents are like bad people it's just like no one teaches this crap and like can you imagine how hard it is to be a parent in today's day and age where it's like there are people like grooming other people on the internet and your parents have to try to keep you safe your [ __ ] dumb ass 15 year old self they're trying to keep you safe it's so stressful and like now they have to deal with like addictive video games right like that's so much worse it's like so much harder it's like screwing up kids brains even more and so it's like it's not easy for them and i think generally speaking i mean hopefully you have parents who love you if you don't you have my sincere apologies but it's hard and sometimes like you know the simplest job of a parent is to keep a child from screwing themselves over it's like you know that's like literally like what your job is as a parent it's like just a your kid is like playing with a paper clip and an electrical socket it's like you just you need to stop that right kid is like i'm going to jump off the roof and fly like you need to stop that kid is like i'm going to destroy my sense of habit and dopamine circuitry through excessive gaming like as a parent like you need to stop that we're not saying don't play games we're not saying don't let your kids play games we're saying like we're not saying also remember no gaming on weekdays after 10 p.m okay on a weekday on a school night we're not saying no gaming on weekdays healthy gamer yeah absolutely so i see that a lot of people are asking questions about ocd and ptsd stuff like that i think um oh do you set boundaries differently with kids with adhd they just become so these are all good questions i think first thing is that you know if you're dealing with someone who has these problems or you yourself have these problems definitely a good idea to talk to a provider about it but generally speaking i'd say yes it does modify the implementation of all of these things so for example someone with complex ptsd may be a lot more vulnerable to their internal emotional drives than the average person this is a case-by-case basis why you need to talk to a clinician because it's not like i i can't think of as i've i haven't read a single study about boundary setting as a person with cptsd before so i don't know if there's research on that that gets that level of specific specificity that's why you need a clinician but generally speaking i find that people who have experienced trauma or have a particular sum scar or things like that there's a part of this process that these aren't equally difficult parts of the process some people are really good at articulating some people are really good at like you know dealing with the emotional stuff some people are really good at emotionally processing afterward some people are like emotionally terrified of ever speaking to someone after setting a boundary with them right so that's where you know just kind of depends adhd this is very important for adhd so there's a lot of stuff about like boundary setting where because of the attentional component the anticipatory part is very important with adhd so that's where like you need to let them know like not just the saturday before the monday let them know a week ahead of time five days three days the day before lots of reminders because of their variable attention it may not sink in this is also why you want to have them articulate their understanding because this is where like a lot of times what happens is kids with adhd who are usually smart will use context clues to figure out what you want them to say it's tricky they don't actually hear you they're just so freaking smart that they figure out what the right answer is and so what you want to do with adhd is make sure you articulate their understanding and give them lots and lots of anticipatory guidance and also i would i would suggest being like less harsh with consequences and give them just it takes to slow it down with adhd like more warnings smaller steps a lot of conversation in between you
