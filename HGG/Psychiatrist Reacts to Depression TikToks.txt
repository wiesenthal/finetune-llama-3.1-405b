so the interesting thing that happens with people with depression is that a lot of them will learn to adapt cope and survive because they're resilient because they're strong because they're adaptable because they're intelligent you think that the best you can do is cope because and that's not foolish for you to think right because that's what's worked for you maybe you've tried treatment right but ssris don't just magically fix all the depression and sometimes the reason we believe in coping instead of fixing is because we've tried to fix it before and it hasn't worked and the best we've come up with is coping so it makes perfect sense that people come to that conclusion but with how conserved depression is across the human race and by conservative i mean by how prevalent and consistent it is across the human race the fact that after we get yelled at we feel like crying and going you know and sitting in a corner for a little while or a long while that's a conserved experience across humanity [Music] okay let's do tick-tocks how often do you still battle with depression oh i'm always depressed all the time um i have to constantly bring myself out of it like i wake up depressed but like i'm like okay now i know my steps because i you learn from real like now i have to go outside and be in the sun for a little bit or go for a walk or like start the day this way it's all just programming yourself to trick your brain you know well you have a suicidal yeah all the time but i can't because i got a mom and a sister and like a family yeah so i think this is unfortunate but it's like a really common experience right so a lot of people struggle with depression and if you pay attention to the question it's like how often do you battle with depression so depression feels like a war right like where you're going into battle with it every day it's like you wake up in the morning and like it's there right it's almost like a daily quest that you have to do like day after day after day after day and over time what happens is people learn how to adapt to it right so like you know people learn how to adapt and they're like you figure out like over time like how to how to deal with it so you go outside get some sunlight that's good right so this is sort of notes in on people think about depression as primarily a mental illness but i think the more i've come to understand i think this is actually a shortcoming in our field is that it's a physical illness too so we know that vitamin d levels for example sun exposure um b12 folate thyroid levels all of these physiologic things will influence your depression and so we develop coping strategies to deal with it right and then the person asks him are you suicidal he's like yeah like all the time and then we also hear about protective factors that's how we deal with it right so even if you pay attention what you're going to hear is that the way he fights the suicidality is by thinking about the people in his life but what i'm not hearing from this situation is that this is ever gonna get better and i've seen this a lot especially in like actors and performers artists where they sort of live with it day in and day out and it's like a constant war and constant struggle it can happen to real people too whereas the one thing that i'd say is that i you know i don't i mean sometimes it really is that chronic for people but in my experience as a psychiatrist like 90 of people or 95 of people don't have to do it that way i know it sounds kind of weird but so this is where when we think a little bit about depression i'm not saying that that you know i'm not judging pete for experiencing what he experiences but i think what happens when we have depression is as human beings we learn how to adapt and we learn how to cope and once we learn how to adapt and cope we stop trying to fix the problem or that's because we think it's unfixable which in turn could be the depression itself right so i want you all to think a little bit about this like if you've got a problem in your house and you like manage a fix right so let's say that i have to like rearrange furniture so that i can plug my computer into a wall but if i get an extension cord and i run it along the the bottom of the floor to the next room and i don't have to move my computer what's going to happen i'm never going to move my computer the extension cord is going to be there it's going to be a pain in the ass my you know my computer is going to look disorganized and i'm never going to fix it so the interesting thing that happens with people with depression is that a lot of them will learn to adapt cope and survive because they're resilient because they're strong because they're adaptable because they're intelligent and once you learn how to cope it goes on the back burner and in the worst cases you think and for some people this may be right i'm not saying that they're wrong but i think thankfully it doesn't seem to be true in most cases you think that the best you can do is cope because and that's not foolish for you to think right because that's what's worked for you maybe you've tried treatment right but ssris don't just magically fix all the depression it's not just a neurochemical imbalance sometimes it requires really deep hard work that people don't have the bandwidth for that people don't believe in and the reason they don't believe in it is because they've tried it before they've tried versions of it they've tried everything and this is what works for them right so you have to respect that but i think it's it's a really dangerous thing to think about depression as something that can only be coped with so i do think it can substantially get better and there's good data to suggest this right so interestingly enough the best the most um promising data i think is in a sense the weakest which is some of this data on psychedelic so i'm not saying you guys should do psychedelics but if you look at the outcomes from these studies of psychedelic assisted psychotherapy it looks like it makes fundamental changes within someone's mind and their way of thinking about themselves there's a whole video about this in in terms of the default mode network and dr k's guide to depression but there's also where we see with meditation is that like there are fundamental changes that happen sometimes in psychotherapy there are fundamental changes that happen with the way that we look at things like with what we wake up with in the morning so struggling with depression is a really really common problem um you know i think a lot of celebrities and performers and creators struggle with it and i think that since they're smart since they're adaptive since they're resilient since they have endurance they develop certain coping strategies and it's really important to do those things it's really important to figure out organize your day figure out what works for you the challenge is that i think unfortunately for the majority of people because every person i've ever met with depression has a hundred percent developed a way to deal with it every single person the interesting thing is that 90 to 95 percent of those people that i've worked with don't have to use those things after about a year of treatment so i think things can permanently get better i really do believe that it's been my experience now if you're someone who's tried treatment and it hasn't worked i'm not saying that it works for everyone that's the really sad thing so we haven't figured out how to guarantee that for people but i think the challenge is is just like the you know the extension cord example is once we learn how to cope it's a really important skill it's what allows us to survive it's different from fixing it and sometimes the reason we believe in coping instead of fixing is because we've tried to fix it before and it hasn't worked and the best we've come up with is coping so it makes perfect sense that people come to that conclusion but if you're in that kind of situation where this resonates with you and the most you can do is sort of survive it i would say don't stop there right try to do additional things really try to get to the root of your depression so sure you can go into the sun and that's an excellent thing movement is good behavioral activation is an evidence-based treatment for depression vitamin d supplementation can help people with depression we have good data behind all that so it's fantastic excellent idea and don't stop there right start to think a little bit about if you're suicidal like why are you suicidal what is it that makes life hard right get to the like you want to use your coping strategies at the top but you also want to go deeper and get to the root of it if you can and some people get to the root of it and there's nothing you can do that's unfortunate but i think thankfully that's the minority of people and depression is your body saying [ __ ] you i don't want to be this character anymore i don't want to hold up this this avatar that you've created in the world it's too much for me you should think of the word as depressed as deep rest deep rest your body needs to be depressed it needs deep rest from the character that you've been trying to play yes that's like very well said so i think sometimes we tend to forget right that depression is like a variant within the human population okay this is something that you'll really have to understand it happens to us arguably for a reason now this is what gets really interesting about mental health is when we think about pathology we think about it as a malfunction of something right so when someone is sick their body is not working the way that it's supposed to but with how conserved depression is across the human race and by conserved i mean by how prevalent and consistent it is across the human race the fact that after we get yelled at we feel like crying and going you know and sitting in a corner for a little while or a long while that's a conserved experience across humanity and so sometimes i think we forget i know it sounds kind of weird that aspects of depression can actually be like adaptive otherwise it wouldn't be there right we wouldn't feel sad and ashamed of ourselves if we get yelled at unless it serves some kind of function now i'm not saying that things don't rise to a pathological level at times but this is my experience as a psychiatrist is that sometimes when people come into my office and they're depressed it's not their brain functioning wrong it's their brain functioning right and i know it sounds kind of weird but like if someone comes into my office and says i have no reason to live i live alone i don't enjoy anything i have no relationships i have no job i'm ashamed of myself i've never amounted to anything in life and the interesting thing is that like those statements could be true like sometimes there are cognitive distortions there are usually some cognitive distortions but sometimes those things are true and so the answer for that person is here take a pill go home that's not the answer the answer is like okay if you have no reason to live like let's work on that right the way to help that person's depression is it's not it's not their brain malfunctioning there may be some kind of malfunction in there but that's their brain sort of telling them that this life is not worth living which sometimes people say like oh that means i should kill myself that's the conclusion people come to i disagree with that 100 don't kill yourself build a life that's worth living that's when people say it's hard and it's like yeah i know it is that's why i'm going to help you you don't have to do it alone right so it's interesting to hear jim carrey talk about deep rest it's interesting so this is the experience like this is what what happens when people really like understand their depression and they have an experience of it and they start to realize that sometimes my body needs this sometimes my body needs this and i think it's especially common for people who as he put it hold up an avatar right we pretend to be this thing for so long that we get tired and i just can't pretend anymore so i'm going to retreat into a hibernating state and then i'm going to muster up the energy to come out and pretend to be this thing again not too you know if that works for you i mean the guy's older than i am and he's i don't know i don't know anything about how long he's been dealing with this stuff or where he gets this wisdom from it sounds really authentic to me sounds like he knows what he's talking about and i think there are other ways to do it right so my experience of people who do this who go into the deep rest version of depression is how can you build how can you stop pretending because if that's what's exhausting how can you be more authentic because it's exhausting it is so hard to be something that you're not you have to work so hard to prop up this idea of yourself instead be yourself but that's hard don't get me wrong it's very very hard it's very hard to be authentic right it's hard to stand up to people it's hard to set boundaries it's hard to be yourself it's hard to be judged so hard to be judged i'm not saying it's easy happens slowly but ultimately like i've seen that too where people once they start living more authentic lives they will become less depressed because you don't need to act anymore you don't need that deep rest you don't run out of mana your gas tank is not empty now some people may say like that's you know that's impossible or you're saying it's making it sound easy i'm not saying it's easy leaving an authentic life is one of the hardest things that you'll ever do but boy is it worth it i've seen that in patients i've worked with in terms of like living authentic lives right so we're talking a lot about work stuff today so i go to work every day i have to pretend to be interested in the scrap i hate it i hate it i hate my job i hate everything about it but i can't quit i can't throw it all away what would i do i'd give up money i would have this this yeah you have to be more authentic yeah there are gonna be sacrifices but it's gonna be worth it almost every single time let me think about that for a second i can't really think of a single person i'm trying to think i'm going through like patients that i've worked with i'm trying to think if there's a single patient i've worked with who's really lived a really authentic life and has not been depressed or it's not improved their depression i can't really think of anyone doesn't mean it hasn't happened i just can't think of them it could be selection bias right memory isn't perfect so the couple of takeaways i think the first is that sometimes it's okay to be depressed sometimes if you're you know it's hard to put on a mask every day and like sometimes the way that your body copes with that your brain copes with that is to retreat from the world and that's okay and i'm hopeful that that cycle can get better by living more authentically right if the problem is that you're tired of lifting up this avatar of yourself don't lift it anymore right that rejuvenates you when you set it down and you retreat the question is can you separate the setting down from the retreating because what is it that really rejuvenates you is it the setting down or is it the retreating that begs the question why do you have to retreat when you set it down what would happen if you set it down and you didn't retreat [Music] yeah so i think there's you know some value to this right but i think this is also one of the problems when it comes to discussions on depression right so we've got like i mean this video is good because it speaks to some of the problems one is that a lot of times doctors will say take this pill to fix your neurochemical imbalance and that's a part of the answer i think it's a problem when it becomes the whole of the answer but sometimes you're not going to understand this unless you actually prescribe antidepressant medication but once you prescribe antidepressant or you're someone for whom has a really good positive effect but there are some people who i will prescribe antidepressant medication they will like turn into normal human beings so i'd say for a third of people antidepressant medication can be revolutionary and life-changing but i'd say about 70 of people it like either helps some or doesn't help much like a third of people get a really strong response a third of people get like some response but is nowhere near enough and a third of people it really doesn't do much so then some people who have depression will sort of like then we also know on the flip side that stuff like sunshine and exercise and things like that have protective effects against depression that's true as well i mean we heard pete davidson kind of say it right getting out getting in the sun we also know that vitamin d levels for example are very correlated with depression we know that exercise improves depression we know that yeah all kinds of mechanisms so exercise getting out in the sun will reduce in from inflammation will reduce cortisol levels all of those things will have positive effects on mood right so those mechanisms are there so on the one hand we've got ssris that may not work for people on the other hand we've got exercise and sunshine and these kinds of things that you're overdosing on right we're also overdosing on like we're not just going outside suddenly we've taken off our shirt and we're showing our six-pack for unclear reasons i don't know what that has to do with anything right except maybe gratification of the ego and then we sort of also get to some really interesting things if we really want to get into this which is that first of all not all depression is the same so this is what i think really frustrates me sometimes is when people make videos like this they assume that their experience of depression encompasses the variance of experiences of depression and this is where like i gotta say as a medical professional like sunshine and exercise are fantastic i recommend it to all my patients but some people have more of a biologic or organic cause for whom sunshine and exercise is not sufficient and to imply that those things will work for everyone i think is like irresponsible right and that's where especially if we look at different so clinical depression the experience of like sadness and depression has a differential diagnosis to it right we don't usually talk about this kind of stuff on stream it has a differential diagnosis to it and it's interesting because one of the causes of people experiencing very high levels of subjective depression is something like narcissism so people who are narcissistic will experience high levels of depression and then the interesting thing about people who are narcissistic is that their depression is a lot more variable and fluctuant and is a lot more environmental in nature so it's not actually a neurochemical imbalance if you give a narcissist who's feeling depressed and ssri antidepressant medication it's actually not going to work because the source of depression is not neurochemical in nature and so then if we really want to go out of line you know like we can start to draw conclusions but we can't really do any of that stuff but sometimes i see these kinds of things where people are like showing off and feeling depressed and they're saying that this works for me it may work for you but i think there's a of what people's depression comes from and what works for it so should you exercise sure should you do vitamin d sure should you get sunlight absolutely or ssri is going to work for you maybe not anti-depressant medication can work for you maybe not but it'll work for some people it'll help for some people and so be careful about judging that everyone else's experience of depression is yours or that your understanding of depression applies to other people because it's not unique it's just like love or enjoyment or satisfaction or how much you like swimming it's variable
