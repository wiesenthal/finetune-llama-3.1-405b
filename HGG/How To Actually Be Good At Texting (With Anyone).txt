should I double text should I not double text like what's going on do this don't do this don't do this don't do this there's different sets of rules for men or women there's different sets of rules for work or friends there's all these different rules and the problem with texting is that no one's following the same rules there isn't one uniform set in fact it's the opposite right we have different rules for different genders is whatever is in the link in the description check it out so today we're going to talk a little bit about texting and specifically I'm going to share with you all one particular insight into how to be a better texter and the weird thing about texting is that everyone is texting more and everyone seems to be getting worse at it right because everyone is coming up with these rules like hey man like don't don't double text Bro like if you double text like if you res if you send one text and she doesn't respond to you then like you shouldn't double text that shows her that like you're like too invested in the relationship so you got to be like a little bit distant right on the flip side people are like oh yeah if he like if he texts you once like don't respond right away that's going to show you that like you show them that he you're easy so instead you have to wait for him to text a couple of times and that like that shows him that like you're not like easy right you're not a pushover so everyone's coming up with these rules of texting people are like as a man like don't send walls of text because it's like shows that you're emotionally a mess and so then people like to send really short things and on the flip side people are like okay like this person isn't invested at all in texting because they send these monosyllabic replies and I'm putting in all this effort and so everyone out there is coming up with rules should I double text should I not double text like what's going on do this don't do this don't do this don't do this there's different sets of rules for men or women there's different sets of rules for work or friends there's all these different rules and the problem with texting is that no one's following the same rules there isn't one uniform set in fact it's the opposite right we have different rules for different genders and so texting has become an absolute mess and people are trying to figure this out and everyone's telling you how to text or how not to text so what's going on here what do we do about this there's one part of texting that no one ever talks about and that is how to receive texts how to read texts because I know this is weird I know this is going to sound kind of complicated it's a boomer concept texting falls under the umbrella of something called communication now communication is this Boomer concept about sending and receiving signals there can be all kinds of different Communications there can be verbal Communications there can be non-verbal Communications there can be texting or written Communications back in the day we had this thing called the letter but the key thing about communication is that it goes both ways there's both the sending of communications and the receiving of communications so if you want to be a better texter what we're going to talk about is how to read texts okay so the first rule is what to do if a text upsets you so a lot of times the reason that we run into trouble with texting is because we get a text and the text upsets Us in some some way right like this person is callous or they're unfeeling or they say something that's insulting or they didn't laugh at my joke or they're cold in some way like I don't know they send us we receive some kind of text and we get upset and so normally when we get upset when we receive a text what do we do I'm gonna text it back I can't believe you're like this we start being like passive aggressive and you're like oh if that's what you want to do and we're like I'm going to capitalize that's right and I'm going to teach this person a lesson so we get upset and so the first thing that we've got to do is if you get upset when you see a text the first thing you should do is don't respond take a moment take a step back re-read the text critically look at the text if you get upset don't assume that you are upset for a good reason because you may that may not be their intention at all right and this is really challenging because when we get upset is when our mind actually doesn't want to reread anything right like we don't want to reread stuff when we're upset like we don't want to stop and think critically this sent me this text you're telling me that I need to pause for a second and read re-read the mean thing that they said that's not what I want to do it runs completely contrary to all of our instincts but why should we do it then right do you see the text that they sent me you want me to pause for a second and reread it and think critically when this sent this what's wrong with you Dr K so let me explain something I know it's kind of weird here's the problem with texting that we miss a lot of information right so texting is in I know it's weird but is in the written format and then it leaves out things like tone body language it leaves out a lot of emotions sometimes it can be hard to detect whether people are sarcastic or serious or we will interpret them as serious when they are being sarcastic or we will interpret them as sarcastic when they are being serious wait what you were serious about that and why is that it's because you can't convey emotion and so then what happened to to fix this problem right so texting inventors the texting technologists decided we're going to create an emoji because a picture is worth a thousand words right so now we can convey things with emoji and so like we went from hieroglyphics to the written alphabet because those are superior to hieroglyphics and now we've come all the way back to hieroglyphics in the shape of emojis if I ask someone hey want eggplant question mark for dinner tonight is that what we're referring to are we referring to a delicious roasted eggplant dip with way too much garlic and green onion or are we referring to something else when I ask you if you want eggplant for dinner tonight so the first thing to understand is that when you receive a text if you get upset don't respond to it right away pause and think critically start to think about the different kinds of interpretations that you could offer them what would be a charitable interpretation to this text or I know this sounds absolutely insane the other thing you could try doing is clarifying it's weird I know but when we get upset we don't want to clarify because we've read that text we know exactly what they meant right we could see their facial expression they were when they were typing it we can hear their tone of voice we saw them laughing with their friends as they were sending it right we know exactly what they meant and that's why we got upset because we we interpreted it correctly so rule number one for being a batter texter if you get upset pause for a second look critically and reread the text okay so the next thing but what if they don't text me to begin with right so it's fine Dr K you're saying okay if they text me and I get upset I should like reread maybe think critically about it maybe ask them for clarification but what if they don't text back what then Dr K so here's something else to understand texting is about convenience I know that a lot of people will like live text back and forth right but generally speaking the whole point of a text is that you can send it at any time and it can be read at any time and responded to it anytime and that may sound weird to all the Gen Z kids or the Gen alpha kids out there or whatever but that's really like if you pause and think about it we have text messages right and they stay on your phone for a while unless you're Snapchatting or whatever I don't even understand how that crap works but for the most part a text message stays on your phone so then what happened is we also had these these weird things now where you can send a voice message right I can avoid I can record a voice message and I can send it to someone and because sometimes that's faster than writing out the text and then what they can also do is record a voice message and send it to me and then we can do that back and forth and eventually we will arrive at this Boomer invention called a conversation so if you're having a conversation with someone the expectation is that when you say something they will respond right when we're sitting there and like talking to each other face to face or there's this this weird function that your phone has it's like a constant live voice message exchange called a phone call and if you use this thing called a phone call that's when you should expect an instant response the first thing to the second thing to understand about texting is that if you're texting people and they don't respond that's okay right it's like if you wanted to talk to them or you need an instant response don't use a text right but what if I get ghosted what if they don't respond for an extended period of time and like like people ghosts nowadays like what's up with that and this also is where pause for a second there is a way to interpret being ghosted so let's start with this how do you know when you've been ghosted is it one day of no responses two days of no responses three days of no responses four days of no responses five days of no responses when are you ghosted six months a year out I imagine so at that point right so how do we decide when we've been ghosted what determines whether we've been ghosted our decision about whether we've been ghosted or not is entirely based on our expectation or our desire for when we want a response I've seen people claim that they have been ghosted after 24 hours of no messages I've seen people get feel like they've been ghosted after one week of no response right so when is the threshold of ghosting I'm not even sure but but what I do know is that a lot of people feel ghosted based on their own internal expectations the SEC Center is that even if you don't get a response for like a week or a month you know sometimes like stuff happens in people's lives generally speaking remember the point of a text message is that it's kind of there and I can get around to it later but sometimes people will I don't know like get into a depressive episode for a little while or like start to become a little bit manic for a couple of weeks or maybe they got coveted or maybe they're really busy at work or maybe their their family member like a family member passed away and this is where you say understandably so right so I I know what you're going to say there well they could let me know right if they're going to be out of commission for a little while the least they could do is have the courtesy to tell me well yeah I completely agree with you so here's my question for you how do you know that they didn't let you know what do you mean of course they didn't let me know if they let me knew I would know right like if they told me I would know well hold on a second how carefully are you reading their texts right so this is insane sometimes people will and you you may know this if you've been on the risk like on the sending end well you'll kind of let someone know you're like hey I'm going to be busy with work for the next couple of weeks you gotta let them know and then like four days later they're like hey like why haven't you texted me back right so like it's because people don't read texts maybe they let you know could they have known let you know a little bit more clearly sure right but maybe they even did let you know so I know it sounds kind of weird but even ghosting is something that you've got to be really careful about that I think a lot of ghosting has to do with your interpretations are you actually reading their texts properly what are the reasons that they haven't responded to you there could be all kinds of stuff and the point of the matter is that we don't know the last thing to consider about being a good texter is to ultimately understand that you can't control someone else's Behavior and the challenge with a lot of these rules is they're actually geared not to like help you feel better about yourself but to gear to elicit a particular kind of behavior right so if we kind of think about it a lot of the texting stuff is about getting other people to respond so if I if my response is too short if I just say hey and they say hey and then I say hey and they say hey and I say what's up and they say not much you and then I say what's up not much what you up to not much hey hey hey so if we have that kind of text exchange I decided to alter my behavior right so I'm going to send a longer message and what am I doing when I send the longer message I'm trying to elicit a particular kind of response so if I send if I double text or triple text or quadruple text people will think I am pathetic and then they will not respond to me and so now what I need to do is no longer double text or triple text or quadruple text I need to send one text and then I need to wait so I come up with all these rules but what's the purpose of the rules the purpose of the rules is to elicit a particular kind of response and this is what's really tricky is like in the back of our mind we just need to understand that we can't control anyone else and how does that help us in texting because here's how it helps us when I take my natural impulses I get excited about Christmas time and so when I text someone I want to talk to them about Christmas time because that's what's exciting to me right now when I start restraining all of my impulses for the sake of eliciting a particular response I'm essentially making a sacrifice for the sake of the texting right then if I don't get that response what happens now I've made a sacrifice and I didn't even get what I paid for and if I didn't get what I paid for then I feel resentful and what do we do when we feel resentful do we process our emotions in a healthy manner no of course not we take that resentment we package it up and we shove it deep deep down inside ourselves into this black pit of our stomach where all of our resentment from our failed texts show up and then what happens is all of those thoughts and feelings come out in passive aggressive ways with the next person that we text so now not only are they dealing with us and our own insecurities they are also have to do with all of the resentment that is piled up and if you have tried online dating you understand this because you are not talking to a human being you are talking to a human being plus the pile of resentment that they carry from trying to date online for two years and texting with people so how what do we do about that take a step back remember you can't control any other human being should you perhaps modify your behavior a little bit with texting absolutely we're not saying you know just burst out and ignore and just talk to people about whatever you want we're not saying you should send walls of text just because you feel like it but in the back of your mind start to think a little bit about okay what am I doing when I text am I really trying to elicit a particular kind of response am I texting because I enjoy it or am I texting because I want something from this person is this a game that I need to play because if it's a game I need to play I better figure out the rules and I better play by the rules and then why do I I get screwed and resentful there because I learned the rules of one person and then I start texting someone else and they're playing with a completely different set of rules but I had to learn this game over here and now you're making me play this different game over here it's so frustrating I'm so resentful and then when person three comes along the resentment comes pouring out so what do we do about that take a step back recognize you can't control anyone's Behavior right and the more that you do that the less resentful you will become so I know it sounds kind of bizarre but this is something that it boggles my mind as a professional Communicator that everything that I see about how to text has nothing to do with how to read a text everything is rules rules rules about what to say and what not to say can you imagine what life would be like if we did that in communication where I'm just blabbing at you constantly and I have my own set of internal rules and I'm not paying any attention to what you actually said of no wonder texting is a mess so if you want to be become a better texter don't worry about the rules you can learn however many rules you want to the problem is you don't even know who you're texting with if they're playing by the same rule book so what's the point of learning the rules instead learn how to read a text properly right and that comes down to a couple of really simple things the first thing is if you get pissed off remember that all kinds of nonverbal communication tone eye contact facial expressions you can't convey any of that sarcasm you can't convey any of that emojis so we try to add in Emotion where we can with Emojis but if something upsets you in a text the last thing that you want to do is take a step back but that's exactly what you should do think critically about the text try to give them a terrible charitable interpretation second thing you've got to do okay but that's in the case of a response that upsets you what if they don't respond remember that texting is ultimately about convenience right so sometimes it takes people a day or a couple days or five days or seven days the other thing is sometimes stuff happens in their life so even their normal texting patterns are not really going to be there there could be something as simple as oh yeah I looked at this text and I wanted to send a very thoughtful response because you said something really cool but I don't have the time to send thoughtful response now and so instead what I'm going to do is just I'll remember to do it later but now it's no longer an unread text and I never see it I forget about it the next day and then this person is left on red for like six months there's all kinds of stuff that can happen sometimes we even get ghosted and what's the deal with ghosting well the first thing to understand is how do you know if you've been ghosted how do individual human beings determine if they have been ghosted the most common measurement for whether you've been ghosted or not based on what I've observed has to do with the expectations and desires of the person being ghosted I wanted a response within 48 hours and they didn't give it to me therefore I am ghosted because if I'm ghosted then I blame them and they're a bad human being and they hurt me so be careful about ghosting you may not necessarily have been ghosted who knows the last thing to understand is that as we start to text we want to win this game in order to win the game we'll make all kinds of sacrifices and so as we make these sacrifices I want to talk about this but people don't like it when I talk about this so I'm not going to talk about this I'm going to talk about what they talk about right so as we make sacrifices we want particular things I'm doing this so that this person will go on a date with me and then they don't go on a date with you and then I'm left with a pile of resentment so remember first and foremost or I guess last and not least that texting you can't control someone else's Behavior through your communication and the goal of communication is to for to a certain degree accommodate the other person but also to represent yourself in what you want it's not about a particular outcome it's about communication with another human being there's a relationship it is not a puzzle to be solved that you have to conform to their wishes so that they will respond to you and the more that we try to control other people with texting the more resentful we become the more resentful we become the harder it is to read texts properly and then it becomes a vicious cycle which is exactly why texting is the mess that we see today so if you want to become a better texter don't worry about the rules of how to write a text learn how to read a text foreign
