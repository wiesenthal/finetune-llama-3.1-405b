[Music] [Music] oh [Music] [Applause] [Music] oh [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] hello chat how y'all doing today we doing good chat meme review absolutely how yall doing today welcome to another healthy gamer G stream my name is all kenoa just a reminder that although I am a doctor nothing we discuss on stream today is intended to be taken as medical advice everything is for education or entertainment purposes only so if youall have a concern or question please go see a license therapist or mental health professional or just any kind of medical professional did yall know that you can just talk so I I got this interesting question recently they're like how do I find a therapist you can just talk to any medical professional and they should be able to refer you the legend has arrived who where are they I don't see them how am I doing I'm a little bit sick today so we've decided to make a call and audible on what we're going to do so instead of doing our standard mental health meme because I don't know if I can talk for two hours today what we're actually going to do is two things we're going to do a guided meditation with the throaty voice and we're also going to do Dr K's guide to sexy talk The Art of Seduction by Dr K step one get viral fitis step two use these words to seduce your prospective partner right you start by telling them hey maybe one day so you know what's actually funny is that when they teach you how to communicate it actually does translate to skill in communication in other parts of your life right because you're very aware of things like body language and tone and things like that and you're very aware of the link between the mind and the body and you know honestly most of arousal is not physical TBH like if you look at the science of arousal um it it's it's mostly mental right and and this is why things like fetishes exist because there is some sort of arguably benign stimulus that creates a physiologic reaction um yeah right and it's it's why you know some women that I've talk to for example we say that forearms are hot right talking so you know we'll teach you we'll teach you everything I guess one day if we ever make a a doctor case guide to communication maybe we'll have a portion on sexual communication all right but enough joking around we have memes to attend to but how how are youall doing today chat yall doing good are we on YouTube now we bounce back and forth I think it kind of depends so sometimes um you know what we've noticed is that there's a different audience in each place so if we've like talked about particular things on Twitch we may come back to YouTube and and you know we we're just we're here to teach people about their mental health and so it turns out there are people on more than one platform so therefore we are on more than one platform it's about as simple as it gets dating coach yeah dude let's go let's go so you know our coaches can help y'all with a lot of things um we just help yall with stuff like motivation and finding purpose and learning how to set boundaries and building work life balance and you know I don't know that they specifically help you with dating but one thing that I think we do see a fair amount is that when people are in coaching for a while they wind up in relationships but I don't know that we actually help specifically with dating what we're usually pretty good at though is helping people understand okay what are your insecurities and issues that trans translate unfettered into your dating life and if we can help you with that stuff then we can it sort of translates right so we have we have a saying in Psychiatry that we I think we translate over to coaching which is that all boats rise together and it turns out that if you just make a human being like more emotionally aware and help them process their emotions and and sort of help them figure out tasks and goals and if they start becoming more successful um on wait a minute hold on no I do not want to log out but one second are we streaming on Twitch chat we shouldn't be streaming are you all hear from twitch this frightens me chat honestly you know one of the greatest regrets that I have is that okay great we're not okay um one of the one of the interesting regrets of you know having a happy relationship which I'm incredibly grateful for not no real regrets but I have this morbid curiosity about online dating like what is it like to date nowadays um you know because it seems rough y' oh no this is something that my kids got me but you know maybe I should turn it around I don't know that I'm the number one dad TBH do you watch us on Twitch yes nope how do I make this go away close pole okay um it's horrible yeah so so you know that that's what's so tricky is like I'd love we'd love to help y'all more explicitly with that but I I think the biggest challenge that I run into personally is that like I have no experience with it right so who am I to tell y'all this is going to work if you were trying to date online yeah so we we're going to try to help yall with that we just don't you know unfortunately like let me see which which text am I reading nowadays I'm reading the vishuda Maga which is a great text by the way but I don't know if the Vish Maga says anything about how to succeed in online dating um okay I see that someone has a question hi hey I'm a so matd Malone is saying welcome Maddie um I'm a psychology student how did you cope during your studies some of the content is super confronting how did you feel while studying oh what a great question so here's the thing about studying Psychology and Neuroscience especially is that it is always incredibly overwhelming so if you're studying psychology or Neuroscience you're just going to get overwhelmed it's the default fault and the problem is because Psychology and Neuroscience is so intertwined and so what's happening is it's it's kind of like you don't understand what the picture is because you only see one piece of it you learn one piece and you learn another piece and you learn another piece but the way that our mind works is that it organizes information like on the whole right so once we understand what the picture is we can fill in the appropriate gaps but Psychology and Neuroscience is so because you can't understand the whole picture as a whole you have to understand one piece at a time so what does one part of the brain do it does this but how does that interact with the other parts of the brain it interacts with all of the other parts of the brain it does this with this part of the brain this with this part of the brain this with this word of the brain so it's it's like tons of memorization but one day if you stick with it it's going to click and if it clicks then everything becomes easy like you start to like it's cool like then you understand okay how do all these parts fit together but it's it's really hard for pretty much everyone I think at the beginning so Neuroscience is fascinating but it's so hard to understand and and it's it's because like I'm just trying to think about like other so like for example you can learn addition without learning subtraction right like you can learn learn the equation the area of a square without learning the area of a triangle like you can learn discret pieces but with Psychology and Neuroscience it's a reductionist approach to something that is actually like irreducible right the mind is like a global kind of thing thanks for the tip Wheezy we appreciate it shall we dive in chat you're ready to go let's do memes okay so let us react to something all right oh sorry sorry sorry sorry sorry muted muted muted I got it the reason teachers are leaving is not because of teacher pay and I will tell you why I'm a band director which means I get paid more than most teachers it's an incentive to show up and stay late for sure but it's not enough even if every teacher in the state of Texas got a $10,000 raise per year we would still be dealing with some of the same issues we're dealing with right now let me just tell you what I've been dealing with in the last 48 hours there's a list yesterday I broke up an assault in my bhole not a fight an assault a kid punching another kid in the head at least four or five times some mystery kid decided to get creative over the last 12 hours when I wasn't paying attention and literally took every single string off of every single French horn that we own making them unplayable I set up a drum set station for my percussionist I was so excited because they have been begging me all year to play drum set took 24 hours for somebody to break the high hat people stealing and using instruments that AR AR theirs even if it's in a locker I had another kid hit somebody else in the face when their trumpet was on their face because they were blowing it in their Direction I had another kid in the same class flip me off and then try to lie about it and before you come at me in the comments saying I knew what I signed up for yeah I do get it but I've been told from multiple people on my campus that the band kids are the best acting well- behaved students on campus and I still have to deal with this garbage every single day this is not a money problem it's not an admin problem it's not a a parent problem it is an emotional disregulation problem never in my 13 years of teaching have I ever had such a problem with kids keeping their hands to themselves and keeping them from destroying property I understand their kids and part of our job is to keep them regulated and to teach them how to do it but I have repeated myself so many times this year I have posted things on the wall I've given them lectures I've written them up I've failed them the corrective measures that we've used in the past do not work anymore these kids do not care if they fail they do not care if they're written up they do not care if they get oss the only thing that most of them care about is how they're going to be entertained in the next 5 minutes of their life and I try not to be a millennial teacher that blames technology because I am steep in technology I love Tik Tok I use technology in my class all the time but it's as if some of these kids have literally given up fun life it's like they've given up on doing anything special and they're 12 they're 12 I was so excited to start this year because I wanted to make some kind of an impact and get back into the classroom but I feel like I've been chasing my tail all year I love my kids but I'm beaten and abused and tired the system doesn't work and we are failing them and the teachers we're failing teachers too yeah so this is wild I had an inkling that things were this bad but I didn't realize things were like this bad and like for the record I kind of agree right so this is where let's understand this so when you've got a bunch of bad kids we want to blame things we want to blame the school system we want to blame their parents but something has changed right so anytime systemically all of the kids are getting worse I don't think you can blame parents I don't think you can blame teachers there's a systems change change going on and what this teacher kind of talks about is like absolutely true and let's run through it so the first thing that we've got to understand is that as we start using technology the rate of ADHD is going up and even if the rate of ADHD as a diagnosis is going up the attention span across the whole is getting worse so even though we're let's say we've increased the rate of ADHD diagnosis by it's gone from let's say it's like 6 % to 11% so maybe we've doubled it but what you have to remember is that the people who are subclinically ADHD so they don't it's not so bad that they get diagnosed but there's a whole subclinical population which is getting worse too so let's understand what technology does it makes us more impulsive it's not just emotional disregulation it makes us more impulsive okay so we're not able to restrain our actions there's absolutely emotional disregulation and that's what technology does we've got tons of studies that show that using social media makes us worsens our mood worsens our attention and so this is happening to kids earlier and earlier and earlier I have a seven-year-old kid who asked me when do I get my phone I got my first phone when I was like 18 or something and the earlier that you expose children to things that shape their brain the worse things get so we know know for example there's evidence that marijuana is a gateway drug and why is it a gateway drug is it because you become morally degenerate if you start smoking pot and then you start using drugs and you get off track probably not what actually happens is when you use marijuana in the developing brain it Alters your dopamin nergic and reward circuitry to make you more vulnerable to Addiction in the future so what's happening is these devices are being used to regulate our emotions so we know that video game there there are fmri studies which show that blood flow to the brain in our negative emotional circuitry decreases when we use technology so if I'm feeling like I'm having a bad day I can play a video game and my emotions will be calmer and then it'll cause me to tilt so there's impulsivity there's emotional disregulation and there's also temporal myopia she's saying that 12-year-olds have given up on life what is temporal myopia when you get dopam energic crap you stop thinking about the future right because your brain is existing in 15minute segments and y'all May recognize this too if you sit down and close your eyes for 5 minutes your brain is going to go wild I need to do something I can't there's no patience it's temporal myopia and so all the kid thinks about is like hey if I ruin a bunch of violins LOL right and then I'm going to start filming it to become an influencer and prank people by ruining their day and all this kind of crap it's all about immediate gratification and this we've seen in in kids with ADHD they literally cannot think about the future they're myop myopic when it comes to the dimension of time and so we have a whole generation that is temporarily myopic and this is the result what's the answer it's actually honestly pretty simple we need a new set of training for human beings how do you stop technology can you try to regulate it sure by the time you regulate it right and there are like hearings going on in the US about whether we're going to ban Tik Tok the damage from Tik Tok is already done even if we ban Tik Tok hell we do it too we have YouTube shorts Instagram reals everyone has already figured out that oh hey shorter and shorter form content gets people engaged right damage is done so you can do government regulation sure what are we going to do teach an army of psychiatrists absolutely we should do that but what are we going to do are we going to send every kid in school to a psychiatrist can't do that it's the parental parents need to do better parents have never had to deal with technology like this before do you all realize like how how hard it is to be a parent today when it comes to technology all your kids everyone's kids kids are getting cell phones at the age of seven so I have to start fighting this battle today as a parent and this is the thing about parenting that we don't understand how do you learn how to parent you grow up with parents you learn what your parents did right that's how we learn parenting it's not like we take classes you don't have to take a class just need Pi in and out in and out right that's all you need and that works there's no parenting courses for Impala or chimpanzees or human beings and it's worked for like the history of existence of life forms on the planet and it's not working anymore because our parents didn't have didn't have to deal with this so they couldn't teach us how to deal with this so we need to do is train each and every human being it's the only way it works that's how what we do in society right we teach each and every kid it needs to be a part of school we need emotional literacy classes in school we need emotional regulation classes in school it needs to be a core part of everyone's education and the cool thing is like why do I believe this will work because it has and you can say Dr K what do you mean it has this teacher is struggling if you're listening to this right now chances are it's helped you that's how I know it works because we started this crazy experiment like four years ago hey can we teach average people about their mental health and can they get better at life turns out the answer is yes yes and what do I base that on I base it on you if you're new to the community you may be skeptical but if you've been with us for a while you know what I'm talking about each and every human being needs to understand how their mind works how to control your mind how to understand what influences your mind for you to be in control of Mind instead of mind being in control of you you want to know what the core problem that this teacher is talking about the children are not in control of their minds their minds are in control of them that's it and as a society why do we see mindfulness with a meteoric rise it's because it's the one thing that is a program that teaches you how to control your mind you want to know how to fix your life get control of this everything else is easy then you say it's hard or I don't think I can have you ever been taught has anyone ever sat down and told you hey here is how your mind works no and then then why because we have this we have this psychology student asked this question hey I'm studying psychology it's overwhelming because the way that the West has studied the mind is as a population not from a a sample size of one Freud listened to people talk and inferred all these complicated theories about the mind the best text on the mind in the East comes from this guy named pangali his text is 400 sentences 300 sentences 318 lines that's that's it because he's talking about the Mind from the subjective hey here is how your mind works from the inside not what is an edible complex CU what do you do with that if you're a human being and you're like oh [ __ ] maybe I have an edible complex you read a book about the edible complex what do you do with that the yogis figured out hey if you have a desire here's how to control it if your mind is wandering here's how to control and we do our best to give that to y'all right that's why we have stuff like Dr K's guide and we have these community events like right in the field so if you want to learn how to control your mind start with the guide join whatever we happen to be doing at the time right and that's the core of the problem is now we have something in society that is so good at taking control of our mind it's getting better and better and better and it's this hijacking your brain because we don't know how to defend and we've relied on other people to defend for us because it worked before seven-year-olds started asking for this can't regulate it away should there be regulation sure do teachers need burnout training absolutely but we got to teach everybody this stuff it's the only way it's going to work questions yeah Melissa chin chinich is saying I I desperately wish Humanity less hopeless I get change comes from within but it is hard when it feels like everyone else couldn't care less about being better it feels that way right it feels that way and why does it feel that way where do you get that kind of information from we get it because the people who are the most hopeless are the ones that we see the most so this teacher for example is completely hopeless and that's why she popped off oh the text is pangali yoga sutas and even then like half the lines aren't even related to the mind I think it's super simple hard to understand we can maybe talk about it one day okay should we move on the reason teachers are leaving is not because of teacher pay and I will tell you why I'm a band director which means I paid more than most teachers it's an incentive to show up and stay late for sure but it's not enough even if every teacher in the state of Texas got a $10,000 ra we would still be dealing with some of the same issues we're dealing with right now let me just tell you what I've been dealing with in the last 48 hours there's a list yesterday I broke up an assault in my van not a fight an assault punching another kid in the head at least four or five times some mystery kid decided to get creative over the last 12 hours when I wasn't paying attention and literally took every single string off of every single French horn that we own making them unplayable I set up a drum set station for my percussionist I was so excited because they have been begging me all year to play drum set took 24 hours for somebody to break the high hat people stealing and using instruments that aren't theirs even if it's in a locker I had another kid hit somebody else in the face when their trumpet was on their face because the hell dude Tik Tok just did it for me Bruh Bruh it just started can you believe that you want to talk about technology inserting itself I didn't tell it to Play It Again it just did it on its own I was like Hey thank God I don't have headphones you you'll get that what I've had to learn how to do to survive in this technological day is to plug in headphones and take them off y'all get that like think about that someone at Tik Tok was like if there is an idle window that is open for some amount of time [ __ ] them start playing the video do you get that like someone made that decision to program it that way we don't care bro you left why come on back and you know why they waited like five minutes because they realized that if we start autop playing right away the person is going to get pissed and they're going to close the tab so I can almost bet you money that they tested some people start Auto playing right away some people were going to wake 30 seconds some people were going to make 1 minute some people were going to make four wait four minutes and then they figured out that like 5 minutes cuz I didn't close the tab I just paused it y'all get that like this is what we're up against the only way to survive is to train this all right I don't even remember what I was talking about let's move on let's go chat right so that that's that's what they someone's saying you can mute the tab so now there's like this War I guess maybe Firefox is looking out for me cuz like there's there's a war between like Hey we're going to Auto mute tabs for you we're on your side and then who's Firefox competing against they're competing against Chrome and Safari so everyone's in competition and they're trying to win you over you're the prettiest Bell of the ball and once they win you over what do you they they get you right so if I'm using this platform they get my ad Revenue they get my eyes they get the advertisers CU I'm purchasing stuff you want to know what I want to do I'm going to run an experiment about whether you can mine someone's subconscious by analyzing their Tik Tok feed I wonder if we took 10 people I've been thinking about this recently and we just looked at their Tik Tok feed could I make predictions about what their insecurities are because the algorithm is really good at figuring it out is Tik Tok better at diagnosing depression than the psychiatrist is we'll see those are the kinds of experiments that I want to run but you know we'll see chat whe that's doable I don't know if the NIH is going to fund this so then the question kind of becomes right so this is where we got to rethink mental health so here we are administering things like phq9 and and all these like surveys well like maybe we don't need to maybe we can just let Tik Tok do it for us right they're they're good at it they don't even realize what they've stumbled on I mean they know what they've stumbled on they don't psychiatrists don't understand what they've stumbled on you don't need Sigman Freud to analyze your dreams you just need to look at a Tik Tok feed I'll tell you what your problems are right how difficult is is it to get funding depends on who you are and what what you're studying all right that's why we appreciate when y'all like donate and stuff like that goes towards our research so we're doing like six studies right now that are all self-funded basically because we study these things because we think they're important and you know other people don't they want to study what's a new medication that will improve depression by 4% more than an SSRI all right let's see what's that what's next Millennials you guys were born into a world that promised so much but didn't deliver whereas we were born into a world that was just F and we knew it was cuz of the internet so we got very low expectations we know the world's going to end in our lifetimes and we just don't really care like one girl in Sweden cared and that that made the news like we sent her around the world like look one of them wants to live have you seen it I feel like even the person who named the generations knew you were done for right they're like yeah we're going to do it alphabetically all the older people they Gen X in the middle they're gen why all the kids they're gen Z I'm guessing someone at that meeting was like hang on um what about the generation that comes after gen Z they're like yeah good one Craig come on Craig time's running out for them that's that's why we called the app Tik Tok [Applause] okay all right so I'm G to do something I'm gonna let's see if this plays again y'all y'all help me out okay chat it auto played holy crap I caught it this time but it auto played okay so this comedian is hilarious and also right so the problem with the millennial generation is that we were sold a formula for Success that did not work so when I was growing up they all said go to college get a degree go to graduate school you'll be special and then with this thing behind you don't worry about student debt by the way with all the stuff behind you you're going to be successful but what had happened is everyone had sort of figured out at least in the US that everyone's going to college and everyone's taking out loans and 18-year-olds don't understand the value of a dollar so we're just going to keep on jacking up loans and education prices and loans and education prices and they even pass legislation in the United States that you cannot declare bankruptcy and get rid of your student loans corporate malfeasance you ran your bank into the ground you can declare bankruptcy commercial real estate you can wipe that debt clean baby let's go you can wipe all the debt clean you want except for student loans that's the one thing we're going to saddle you with no matter what and so this generation My Generation got screwed I'm one of the lucky ones right because my parents had enough resources to get me through things and then the next Generation yall were like hey the gener above us is like so we mentally checked out and now there's this existential nihilism we even have a word for it there's a class of people who embrace it doomers these people are so common that we gave them a word they're the doomers because here's what happened is that like all the stuff that was supposed to work doesn't work and so now each and every person out there is struggling to figure out how do I navigate the world and by the way it's scary because like there are parts of it that are falling apart and then we see a rise in pornography addiction what does that have to do with anything number one variable that correlates with pornography addiction is meaninglessness what am I going to do everything's falling apart guess I'll jerk off and that's where we are now this is not like a moment where Dr K is like and here is the answer I have studied all of the yoga texts and I have discovered for you how to fix it do this meditation breathe download my app herpi this one Cal do all these things pay me $5.99 a month and I will fix it these are our answers May 599 I'll fix it for you all these things are falling for don't worry $5.99 oh because of inflation $7.99 now because you are sharing with your friend no password sharing get wed noobs but give me the money it's okay I'll fix it don't worry problems don't worry buy this thing oh now you have to watch out for forever chemicals I have a new pan this is what we do on Dr K's only pans okay only pans we have this new pen that has no forever chemical buy this thing it will make it better or your brain is busted you cannot focus you are failing out of school take this new Tropic I will do the brain hacking come let's do brain hacking world is falling apart you're [ __ ] in life let's the hack the brain right and brain hacking is just like when we do hacking in the movies and we go and there's all those things and it's all [ __ ] same with brain hacking same because now we are going to do all these things and we are going to you know don't worry I got your back what are we going to do about climate change we are going to send MIT scientists will send something into the space and they'll fix it that's actually pretty cool though and this is where we are now what are you supposed to do I have no idea what you're supposed to do what the [ __ ] right buy more stuff do our thing and we do that too right like we do that you got to play the game and it's like that's where we are now so now like the real challenge is that you all have to figure things out for yourself this is what's so damn confusing when people sign up for coaching they're like hey I thought you were going to give me a plan we're like we don't do that and then people like what the [ __ ] bro I thought you were going to fix my life and it's like hey bro hate to break it to you there isn't a formula for that we have to actually understand who you are as a person and then once we understand who you are then we can get around to fixing your life and they're like eh not for me I'm looking for answers and then some of them drop out right it's tough it's tough out there chat I hate to break it to you it's tough yeah so we try right we just had a we just had a video come out recently about how to control what you can control in life so we're doing our part right and by all means check out our only pans to get these non forever chemical free pans only pants that's great right I need a 45 minute NE Netflix exclusive of Dr K playing that character yo if you can get ne Netflix on board Matt low I'm there son I'm there on the DL though I've actually started writing that

pansexuals we're only for pans the physical the cooking pan I have not seen the '90s movie brain candy yeah y'all if y'all want to make it happen let's go let's do it okay okay let's move on all right oky doie Pokey pokei let's see what's next and I really feel like we don't speak about this enough is people don't realize how often men are EXP experiencing a lack of intimacy and the only place that they can experience that intimacy is through [Music] sex we've created a society where men are so afraid to be vulnerable with each other to be you know sensitive with each other to care for each other to love each other is there anything I can do to help you I can use a hug I'll give you a hug seems like you got a lot going on man it's all right it's all right man I hope we get to the place where guys go oh I actually I actually didn't need the sex I need it to be held and I live in a society where it's hard to be held unless I'm having sex because as guys you can't just go to a guy and be like just hold [Music] me oh this is nice for you never know how much there are many sex workers who who've talked about this where they'll talk about how many men will pay them and then say hey can we just talk I am I want to kill myself fill this up that is exactly how it works by the way there's no fun for men's mental health and it's the biggest killer for men between like 21 and 45 and no one talks about it no one even mentions it lad men just kill themselves and no one cares we need to change it I would have gone with you to the end fires a m you know what you used to be no paric what did I used to be nice you used to be nice and did you never used to be [Music] oh God maybe you never used to be what do you want to be when you grow up kind [Music] [Music] all right chat so real talk for a second I know the music was good and I know Trevor Noah was compelling but this is true in a nutshell so male suicide has been a problem for like 60 or 70 years it's on the climb we don't really talk about it very much and if youall want to know like in a nutshell we can tell y'all I can tell y'all honestly what I think about it and it's maybe a little bit surprising so the first mistake that we make about male suicide is that it's a mental illness problem and this may surprise yall because you're thinking like hey if people are killing themselves aren't they mentally ill I recently saw a really interesting study I don't know if it was a meta analysis or not up to 60% of men have no evidence of mental illness when they kill themselves up to 60% think about that for a second cuz we assume that if you kill yourself you are mentally ill there is something busted in your brain and when we make make that assumption we actually Doom a lot of people to the path of suicide because what this study suggests and this is what I've seen in my clinical practice I would say up to 60% makes sense too I would say about half of men that I've worked with who were suicidal are not mentalo what that means is that the world that they live in puts them in unwinable circumstances where quitting the game is the only option they're not ill they're hopeless there's a big difference and the moment that we started calling hopelessness illness we stopped trying to help those people where they need help because what we said is that the problem is in you right so when there's a man who's suicidal what do we say by calling it mental illness hey bro the problem is inside you it's not your circumstances sure as hell ain't my fault or their fault the problem is in you and you need to fix it which is exactly what we do to men you have a problem in life you need to fix it you struggle with something you need to fix it and by labeling all suicidality as mental illness we have done the same damn thing again because now who's responsible for fixing your mental illness you are to a certain degree your provider it's your fault it's not the world that you get live in it's not the expectations that you have to face and so this is the really interesting thing anytime we have a systemic observation about a class of people we try to fix the system right and it's good that we do that so I worked in a jail for three months it was 3 weeks before I saw a white person as a patient think about that for a second and what we know as Society does that mean that white people are less likely to be criminals no not at all we need to fix the system but there's one system that we don't fix in favor of men right and that's when it's against the men and we call it a mental illness problem now I'm not saying that suicidality is not related to mental illness I'm also not saying that you should not seek mental health treatment if you are suicidal because even though 50% of them I would not diagnose someone with a disease doesn't mean that I wasn't able to help and because that's where the help is and so our society has changed and by the way since n 1990 mental illness I mean Su male suicide rates are increasing it's gone from about 18 out of 100,000 I think to about 22 out of 100,000 so we've gone up by like 25% 20% it's on the rise and what causes this I know it sounds kind of weird honestly I think a big part that is underappreciated is homophobia you may say what the hell does homophobia have to do with male suicide so when I was growing up everyone was so homophobic and so what are men not allowed to do touch each other I remember when I first went to India at the age of 21 I had a friend who's getting married and so he was like 28 or 29 I was 21 at the time so he like his friends heard so these two Indian dudes walk up to this guy and he puts his arm around both of them and they put their arms behind his back and one of the dudes starts rubbing his belly so it's like three dudes like one dude like a dude on you know like wings of like dudes and they're like laughing and they're like oh bro like you're gon to get married and one dude is like touching another dude's belly I'm like what is this this is gay I grew up in East Texas and touching another dude is like off limits and so as a as a nation and a society we became so homophobic that dudes stopped touching each other and so then what are you left with the only place that you get touched is by your mom or by a romantic interest and why is that screwing up romantic relations it's screwing up romantic relations because now let's assume heteronormative for a second the women in our life are responsible not only for our romance but are becoming responsible for the touch starvation that we have in all of the other dimensions in their life in our lives and so now this woman is responsible for f fulfilling all of my touch needs because I'm not allowed to touch another man I've heard from school teachers who are like I'm not allowed to hug my kids I can't touch them I've had patience mix race couples hugging their kid at a playground people will call the police if you're mixed race if you're mixed race couple and you're a mom and you have a kid that doesn't look like you everyone assumes you're a nanny if you're a dude everyone assumes you're a pedophile it's wild CU here's the thing what people don't understand is that mental illness even or not mental illness let's talk about mental health mental health the foundation of mental health is connection our brains in order for our brains to be healthy they need other human beings so what does our gut need to be healthy it needs like a balanced diet what does our skin need to be healthy we we have to bathe occasionally maybe put some coconut oil on whatever we have certain things that our organs need to be healthy right you need a certain amount of water for your kidneys to be healthy what does the Mind need to be healthy it needs other humans or connection of some kind and now what we've done is we've reduced the scope of mental illness or mental we've reduced the scope of mental health to mental illness and mental illness exists fully within one person and just think about this for a second right cuz our science is getting better we have so many more brain scans we have so many of these evidence-based therapies we have third generation antis psychotics like aeropol which can now be used for depression we have all of this stuff our science is getting better and we're losing the war on Mental Health why it's because we assume it exists within one person it's the one of organ of the body that requires someone else and this is why dogs and cats have a protective effect on suicidality and mental illness because if you're a dude you can't touch other people you can't ask people to touch you right even if I say it there's going to be a thousand people like H didn't touch me bro like theing pedophile creepy you can't do that you can't walk up to someone and say Hey can I have a hug what are they going to do they're going to call you a creep so if you really look at the research what are the two variables that correlate the most with male suicide it's isolation and thwarted belongingness what does that mean thwarted belongingness that's a mouthful it means this person is trying to fit in and the world is not letting them and I've seen this in men who are privileged one patient I'm going to call him Thor because he's like Thor he's tall he's handsome he's muscular he's successful and Thor is on the verge of suicide everyone's confused why he makes seven figures a year happily married has kids and what happens if you're a successful man today if you do your duty people come and ask you for help right because that's what a man's supposed to do you're supposed to help other people can't look out for yourself that makes you an [ __ ] so soon he's taking care of this person and now he's taking care of this person and now he's taking care of his parents and he's paying this person medical bills paying this person's mortgage and the people keep coming and keep coming and keep coming on the flip end of the spectrum I remember working with a a guy in jail in jail at the age of 19 suicidal how'd you get here I sold drugs why'd you sell drugs because my family told me that a man provides and I have to sell drugs it's the only way I can pay the rent why are you paying the rent for four adults in your house I don't know they just told me that I needed to do it thwarted belongingness you try to do what people ask you to do and you're not allowed to ask for help and by the way you're mentally ill so take this pill one day at the end of a therapy session Thor told me that he loved me now this is a problem for a psychiatrist we literally have classes about this don't tell patients you love them and sure as hell don't hug them I've had some supervisors tell me that you should never touch a patient there are good reasons to believe that because sometimes people are traumatized and whatnot right so I'm not saying that it's it's bad but it's like now what like this person has no men that he can say this too and we've formed a bond and now what do I say I didn't know what to say CU all my training in that moment what did I want to say I wanted to say I love you too bro and then it would be done but I can't do that right so the one person that men are allowed to go to and they can convey their feelings to is not allowed to tell them that they love them like by our Professional Standards to Made Real five head move I just started crying because I felt so sad because that's what I wanted to say but I couldn't and so I started crying turn on the Waterworks baby trump card and then we had a good cry together right and I think he got the m message and then we hugged and I talked to my supervisor about it we kind of you know talked about it and things like that and this is the problem today is that like we're we don't let we're not taken care of men because we expect men to take care of themselves and even by labeling it mental illness we're reinforcing that thing because then it's not our responsibility it's their responsibility and despite advances in mental health and mental health treatment and all this kind of stuff male suicide is still on the rise and no one's talking about it why because they're privileged why do we need to help the privileged right and there's a good argument for that too and now today we're we're invalidating their experiences people are asking for help and we're shooting them down we're like hey it's all stupid mental illness inside you and by the way we did that to women for decades and centuries and that was terrible centuries 200 years when women complained we as a profession of Psychiatry called it hysteria you're upset girl it is because of your uterus we don't have to take your complaints seriously because you're ill your uterus is making you act that way and that lingers today where when women get upset people don't take them seriously oh you're just being emotional whether you're being emotional or not you can still have a valid complaint the medical profession does this I've heard horror stories about gynecologists who are usually Men by the way who don't take their patient seriously because they're women and they're emotional still lingers to the day we did this [ __ ] for 200 years I hope we learned our mistakes so that men don't have to suffer it too is that fair no but I don't want fairness in this situation if we screwed up and we did an injustice to an entire 50% of our population for 200 years I'd hope we can learn from that and not do it to the other half a win here is not equality a win here is learning from our mistakes so if you're a dude who's struggling with suicide by all means go see a mental health professional doesn't mean you're mentally ill but it also doesn't mean that mental health professionals cannot can help they can help they can absolutely help and it can be so awesome just to learn hey I actually do not have a diagnosis this is an appropriate reaction to a terrible situation there's nothing wrong with me that can be liberating and for the rest of y'all try to hug someone that you know ask dudes in your life do you need a hug and for those of you that have been burned by hugging men which I don't blame you for if you're not ready to do it yet don't do it right because that like this is the problem is like we can't really blame women for this one because when sometimes when women are enter enter in the space and they offer a hug dudes are so starved for any kind of thing that we don't know how to deal with it and then we dump all of our needs onto this person and we become inappropriately attached if there's a starving dog at your doorstep and you feed at once and you get annoyed when it comes back and it starts [ __ ] all over your patio I can't blame you for being annoyed but let's understand that if there's a starving dog in your feet at once it's going to come back because it has nowhere else to go so give invite the men in your life to cry invite the men in your life to hug you and dudes start touching other dudes and I can guarantee you that that [ __ ] is going to get clipped why because we cannot listen to that statement without thinking about L gay right and that's the problem because the only part of this talk that is ever going to get seen is that clip questions I guess right like people are saying Oscars like start touching people up yeah man because the memes is what spreads seriously I mean like this ain't going to work chat it's not working what we're doing is not working I don't know I just know what people need if you want to offer it to a stranger go for it and for the record it's not like I we talked about a woman like a week ago who's struggling with touch starvation so we're starting to see equality but in a really bad way it's sad I'm not saying that women don't have their fair share problems they absolutely do maybe even more than their Fisher but it ain't a competition just because one person has breast cancer doesn't mean that we can't have compassion for testicular cancer and the right move is not trying to make it even it's improving both of their lives yeah so Josh Hutchinson is saying big virtual hug so I'm blessed so first of all thank you I appreci iate it and this is the problem because what's happening in society is that we are getting technology to start fulfilling our needs instead of interacting with someone and purchasing groceries I can have them delivered to my house without a single interaction instead of going somewhere and ordering food and interacting with a waiter or waitress I can now have something delivered to my home instead of playing games with other human beings like soccer and football and [Music] tag and I used to play a game with kids on my street called multitype which was like when you pick a brand of a particular thing and then you get to use that thing in some kind of imaginary competition so like my brother picked Lego and I picked GI Joe so like when we were playing he could use Lego things and I could use GI I don't even know what the game was we used to make that kind of crap up but now we have video games so we don't need to interact with another person and now we even have you know what used to happen is we' like if I'm struggling at work I would go talk to a mentor and talk things through with another human being if I'm struggling now I have chat GPT that does a better job than a mentor can we're substituting all of our needs through technology but there's one need that technology has not been able to reach yet and that's physical touch and boy when when that happens we're GG right we've got devices we have AIS we've got wuss this is all coming together and soon we'll have someone that can talk to you can listen to your problems someone something and there will be a physical component but so far what we're seeing is that technology is like a halflife it makes us like a vampire it doesn't give us like the full thing it just gives us a fraction of the thing echoing horror saying we need hug bots so yes and no the echoing horror of that is that we don't need hug Bots we need hugs we shouldn't develop Bots to hug people I mean maybe we'll end up doing it and I'm not saying that it won't be helpful someone will do a clinical trial about the efficacy of hug Bots and depression they'll show a positive effect because I guarantee you there's going to be some positive effect we don't need hug Bots we need hugs why can't we as humans just do it bro well you know what may save us seriously is like cats and dogs and cows and pigs and pet rats that may be what saves us it's they're doing good work I don't think we we don't really acknowledge you we talk about solutions to the Mental Health crisis we don't really acknowledge that like our best allies right this is like I don't know like the rohim showing up at the siege of uh what's that uh can't believe it's an embarrassment that I'm forgetting the name Helms Deep the road room showing up is like cats and dogs like they're the only thing that's keeping us in the game we don't even realize it do you need a hug I would like one but thankfully I'm lucky enough to where I've got a family that can give me that right and the real challenge is that for a lot of us we only get it from our family and I got it when I needed it but you know we can't as men we don't cuddle with each other and that's a tragedy right that's why we have cats and dogs and romantic partners and to a certain degree kids but only until a certain age right yes Anonymous 247 is saying guys start families you need help with that and that's my point as a dude you can't start a family someone else has to start one with you you have to join one for dudes it's just solo q that can be a sad way to play the game of life there's this person in India called the hugging saint am I crying I got a little emotional there but I'm good now not to say that crying is bad the other thing that y'all can do seriously is like have a good cry so we're going to talk about this for a second so sometimes I'll ask my patients and I learned this from one of my supervisors who was at Mass General Hospital as well and was from down south so this guy would be like when was the last time you had a good cry he'd ask his patience this question when was the last time you had a good cry and then like something about the way that he said he was just like he was some kind of wizard CU he just say that and like people would be they just start crying and he'd like hug them and there you go let it out let it out there it's all right now it's all right he just like had this beautiful silky smooth southern accent and the thing is like we don't talk about having a good cry even the men that I worked with especially they can have a bad cry they can go into the corner of their house when no one's around and be in isolation and cry that's hard for a lot of dudes but the good cry is something that's really hard to find the good cry is when you cry and usually someone else is there and then you feel good we know how to feel bad when we cry as a society but we've lost the ability for the good cry that's what happens in therapy right half of therapy is the good cry it's like the cry and it's like you know and we'll I usually like talk about hugging my patients and stuff we figure out what the right boundaries are and then we'll have a we'll have a hug so I hope y'all are able to good cry and give other people around you the chance to good cry just ask them when was the last time you had a good cry and people like what's wrong with you like come on man you know and give people that chance it's okay to cry you don't have to fix it especially as dudes we want to fix everything you don't have to fix it just let him cry it'll be a good cry a good cry is when you're usually sad or in grief and then you start crying and someone accepts that and then you feel better yeah and now we're seeing it in chat like I haven't cried with someone since dude how though I don't cry I hear y'all and this is where I haven't figured out look I'm a decently smart guy pretty well trained learned a lot of stuff I have not yet figured out and I'm going to work on it how to teach people how to cry over the Internet yeah this person who's got I think it's cilic the the E Eastern European Russian characters cuz the corner is the manly way to cry you're damn right if you're crying at all better Cry Like A Man by yourself or no one can see you or hear you is there a cry meditation I'm going try to figure it out chat people like I haven't cried in 10 years okay and we see that sometimes on stream when we interview people right like so I know we can try it now you don't want to try it let's try so the first thing is it's really sad that you haven't cried in a long time seriously like think about the life that you have to live where you are not allowed to cry I mean sure you're allowed to cry but you can't actually do it you can't blame anyone for not crying right people will tell you that it's okay to cry but you know it's not okay to cry cuz people will treat you differently and that's sad and it's honestly kind of tragic that you've had to carry this around all by yourself for such a long time and there there's no end in sight and you've kind of given up on that cuz it's been 10 years what's 11 what's 12 what's 13 what's 14 that's just your lot in life you've been like a good boy and you've just accepted it and it's so tragic that you're missing something in life and you've given up complete hope that it'll ever be there you've just taken it off your plate you've gotten rid of the possibility that you'll ever be able to cry and the Really tragic thing is you're kind of okay with that you've learned how to survive being cut off from a part of yourself and what's really tragic is that you've had to learn how to survive being cut off from a part of yourself and you deserve more you should be able to cry and not be judged for it people should be able to respect you even if you cry but you've lived a life where that just hasn't been an option right and what are you doing now feels bad man because even if I'm trying to help you get there you don't want to go and that's okay it's okay that you don't want to go it's okay that you're not ready yet it's okay you're not doing anything wrong right whatever you're doing right now is totally fine don't beat yourself up for it I'm not going to judge you for it I'm not going to say hey you should be crying if you want to cry cry if you don't that's okay we're going to be patient and whenever you're ready we are here you may not be ready now you can listen to a recording of this when you're by yourself it's late at night no one's around whenever you're ready you can do it you can do whatever you feel like it's all okay right so some people are saying now that got me I did tear up a bit but you can't do more don't know more just a little bit just a little bit that's enough feel the lump in my throat no more so shui is saying you're making me want to hug and cry with everyone yeah that's what we need to do I met someone recently that I'd known for a long time over the internet and I met them and my first response was actually just crying like I just started crying and they started crying and then it was great and we just hugged and then we like got on with our life it's okay to cry and if y'all don't know how it's probably cuz no one showed you how right if you're a dude anyone teach you how to cry did your dad cry in front of you did your dad cry with you did your brothers cry in front of you did your brothers cry with you did your friends cry with you in front of you of course not then how the hell are we supposed to learn what you did learn from them is your dad got kind of emotional and the lump was in his throat and he choked it down so what did you learn you learn how to choke it down right yes some someone saying I took shrooms and it helped I'm happy it worked for you but I wouldn't recommend it all right shall we move on yeah fist bumping is how men hug nowadays that's the problem should fist bump with your whole body all right let's do this one I'm going to tell you what it's like to be a mom in America right now I started taking a picture of my son every single day before school because I want to make sure that in the event of a school shooting I know with certainty what he wore to school that day I told my son that even though the teacher tells him otherwise I want him to be the last in line if the fire alarm is pulled because statistically it is a higher chance that an active shooter is pulling the alarm to L lure the children out than an actual fire I refuse to get my son light up shoes because he can't hide in a closet if his shoes are lighting up I'm adding a bulletproof insert to my kid's backpack for his school supply list next year meanwhile people are more worried about their second amendment than my soon to be second grader and yet still every single day my son is expected to place his little hand over his heart and pledge allegiance to a country that doesn't give a [ __ ] if he's safe at school I don't know chat I mean things are so messed up in America right now yeah I mean so I'm with y'all that it seems a little bit paranoid seems a little bit paranoid right but I I want to say that we've had something like 300 mass shootings in 2023 in America so the scary thing about being a parent in America right now is you can watch that and you can think wow that that's too that's uh that lady's paranoid but here's the thought that I think a lot of parents are having In America which is how paranoid do I need to be to keep my child alive right because it's happening there was a school shooting a few months ago about like 60 or 70 miles from where I live maybe a little bit more and everyone we kind of know right like oh like this is happening all over the place no one thinks it's going to happen to them do you want to take that kind of chance with your kids life I think there's we we've done stuff on school shootings before like we've already talked about it I think that this it's kind of simple like there's from a data perspective the answer is simple it's reduce the access to guns and I think like even if you kind of think this through I think there's some problems with like we can give people more guns to protect them because I just want youall to imagine this scenario okay let's say you hear some gunfire in like a public place like a shopping mall and you walk in and you've got your gun ready and you see someone standing up with a handgun out shooting in a particular direction what do you do you pull out your gun and you shoot him right cuz they're shooting and then a few seconds after that you get shot you're like what the just happened cuz the person that you shot was the person that was trying to shoot the original shooter and was trying to defend everyone and you just shot them and then someone else walked in and saw you shooting at someone and they were like oh crap there's the shooter and they shot you how are you supposed to when everyone's got guns how are you supposed to identify who the bad guys are like really like I'm not trying to be political here I'm just trying to ask like let's play the tape through to the end like literally what do you do in that situation now there's like four people shooting at each other who's the good guy and who's the bad guy right all yall are saying Turn friendly fire off yeah so video games have controls like that real life does it you can't turn friendly fire off in real life there's no way to do that right it's that that that's like that's the problem this is why you could play FPS games like do y'all real like yall have played have y'all ever played an F FPS game with friendly fire off any kind of FPS with friendly fire off is a train wreck this is why all of the FPS games have friendly fire on right where you can't hurt your allies because otherwise you literally cannot play the game there's no point in strategy tactics Victory because you're just going to be shooting your allies and it's GG that's the world we live in the actual real world we live in is that you can't design a game like that because it's [ __ ] the only salvation that we've got is that there's no auto aim there's no aim assist only salvation we've got even drg doesn't have friendly fire right like I think if you hit someone with a bullet it doesn't hurt them they can take damage from Gren ades and stuff but the other thing about drg that makes it acceptable even if you do have Friendly Fire is it's threedimensional I can grappling hook to the [ __ ] ceiling and I can build platforms and I can dig a trench you can't do that IRL the games in which there's some degree of Friendly Fire have like the ability for basically the characters to fly drg mentioned of course drg is epic you all know what I'm doing with drg I'm waiting like I want to wait like a year or two until there's like a whole new set of missions we're going to go back through it you can't just sign up when there's just one new mission you got to wait till like 3 or 4 life has a bad game design brah life has arguably the worst game design arguably has the best I don't know so the cool thing about life though is that even if there's a crappy game design we can to a certain degree change the rules that's what's cool about it so we have some command console functionality right we have things like science you can at least party up and Tackle problems together okay okay let's move on sorry y'all if the last one was too loud death is just the end what's the point what's the point in what Liv might as well just kill yourself um this one we need higher volume right but if death is just the end what's the point what's the point you want live in might as well just kill yourself so if you're watching a movie and you're really enjoying it something with Kevin Harting yeah and someone points out that this will end eventually you just go oh forget it then what's the point and just turn it off no cuz I can watch it again well I think life is precious cuz you can't watch it again I mean you can believe in an afterlife if that makes you feel better doesn't mean it's true but once you realize you're not going to be around I think that's what makes life so magical you know this place makes me wonder yeah what's that Bo which would be worse to live as a monster or to die as a good man one day you'll eat your last meal smell your last flour hug your friend for the very last time you might not know it's the last mon so that's why you should do everything you love with passion you know treasure the few years you've got because that's all there is I watched Ride Along too five times well you haven't wasted your life then oh beautiful got to hand it to Ricky jvas doing some strong work there all right so there's one really important thing to understand and that is time is a scam okay so if we think about what screws us up most of the time in life it is time why do you waste today because there is tomorrow that which can be done at any time will be done at no time why is procrastination so successful procrastination is a solution by the way I wait till the end the last minute to get things done time in our conception and relationship with time causes us so many problems so if I think about eating some food the enjoyment from the food is in the food everything else is a scam oh I can eat it tomorrow so I'm going to take it for granted therefore I don't enjoy it appreciate today because it'll be different tomorrow you know when everyone who's ask these questions what do you wish you knew when you were now that you're older what do you wish you knew when you were young people like take care of your body right which is true by the way why should you take care of your body it's because in order to be healthy the older you get the harder you have to work it's like an exponential difficulty curve right it's a it's kind of like one of these games that like there's round two and round four and round they don't end you just keep going until you die that's what life is and it gets exponentially harder because your back hurts and your immune system starts falling apart and your kidneys are falling apart and now you need dialysis and you can't think clearly because you have so much ammonia nitrogen in your brain your brain is clouding in your 20s you could be like eat [ __ ] don't take care of your body and still like everything works time is what screws us up so much right I'm 30 years old should I go to college I'll graduate when I'm 34 four years from now you're going to be 34 anyway I got a late start in life other people are ahead of me someone else graduated when they're 16 and I'm 18 I still haven't graduated time screws Us in so many ways so why does like all these people like budha what do they do where's all this crap with meditation and stuff the point is to get rid of the dimension of time if you can get rid of the dimension of time your life will become comes so much easier it's kind of weird say you're eating a sandwich can you get a better sandwich in the future are you comparing it to your sandwiches of the past both of those will decrease your enjoyment this is a sandwich and this is it even if there's a food that you dislike if it is the only time in your life that you are going to get to try that food you will actually enjoy it more today is all I have how am I going to spend it and you may say okay if today was the last day of my life I would live the most honic day of my life and so even if that's the case think about it for a second right because we don't actually live to maximize our joy we don't wake up in the morning and think to myself how am I going to pack as much awesomeness into today today as I can we wake up and we [ __ ] scroll and then a little bit of dopamine there and a spurt there and a little bit there and now watch something now I'm wandering over here and now I'm hungry so I might as well eat something we don't actually try to even enjoy every day we just avoid work because we can do it tomorrow and then we feel guilty about that and we manage that guilt with some kind of like lukewarm pleasure it's like a halflife with not enough effort and not enough enjoyment and not enough of every anything and so if you start to like live without the dimension of time something interesting is going to happen you want to go into Hedonism and try I'm saying have a great day treat yourself you know line up a great day you say what about tomorrow well [ __ ] you're going to procrastinate anyway so you're not going to lose anything might as well enjoy yourself and once you start doing that something cool will happen because the more hedonistic you become at some point when you go to bed you're going to think to myself you're not actually going to think this was an amazing day maybe the first day you do it second day you're you're going to think to myself I'm actually not happy with today Third Day the more days that you have of hedonistic enjoyment the more regret you will have at the end of your day and then you will discover something really important in addition to the Hedonism if you do something good if you help out another human being if you actually do study for a couple of hours because think about when you go to bed at night what are you the most proud of what makes you happy and fulfilled I don't know if you all have experienced this but there's this good tiredness it's like if you went for a hike you feel tired at the end of the day but in a good way it's like I used this body today and it was good there's some days that you do a good job at work and you absolutely crush it and you feel tired you feel cognitively drained or you have a fight with your significant other and you all talk things through and youall feel emotionally spent learn how to feel spent that's good that's the problem is we get confused between tired and spent if you want to start like really enjoying life and that's the cool thing is once you feel spent you actually are okay with that even if it was painful in the moment you feel good about yourself and then what'll start to happen is you're going to start cultivating that because the Hedonism isn't enough and when we say live every day to the fullest this is what we're talking about be spent at the end of the day not tired spent you may say how do I do that well you know those things that are hard that you feel spent at the end of the day that's how you build your life because the more that you spend your days instead of wasting them the more your life will move in the right direction and don't get scammed by your mind because your mind will say it isn't enough it hasn't happened yet our mind screws us with the dimension of time I have so many patients will start treatment Psychotherapy plus medication let's say 6 months in 8 months in their life is now good they are happy they are healthy they're doing well at work going on vacation they come into my office what do they want to do they want to stop the medication and it's fine right so if they want to stop the medication it's my responsibility as a doctor try to do that in as safe as way as possible this is where I tell them to hold on a second you've spent all of this energy to get to where you are just enjoy it what if I'm on the SSRI too long talk about that here's the data here's what it shows chances are you'll be fine we always worry about the future and it paralyzes Us in the present we're so terrified of someone breaking up with us that they we drive them away if you're in a relationship enjoy it enjoy it if you're eating a meal enjoy it if it's not good enough you can enjoy it anyway last last thing I'll leave youall with if you really want to understand this because Yogi figured this out was brilliant mind has two fluctuations that lead to suffering worry anxiety is in the future regret is in the past when your mind goes to those two places you will end up with worry and regret then you may say to yourself no no no but in the present I can be anxious no you can't can't be anxious unless you're in the future if you walk up to someone and you you're anxious in the moment you start to think if I open my mouth I'm going to be I'm going to sound like an idiot what are you actually thinking about you're not thinking about the present you're thinking about the future consequences of the present action there's a physiologic level to anxiety as well which can absolutely exist in the present right so we know some things from science that maybe the yogis missed maybe they didn't but if you really think about it you can't this is why mindfulness is a treatment for both depression and anxiety because anytime your mind exists in the present you can't have a regret I am ashamed ashamed of what you're not ashamed of the present you're ashamed of the past the nature of it you can't feel guilt over what you're doing now you can feel guilt of things that have been done in the past or you can have an anticipation of guilt in the future we experience guilt in the present it's the only time we experience things so if you can Free Yourself of the dimension of time you're freed of a lot of different things questions good night Samuel okay yeah well said see time isn't the Cure time is the wound brilliant time heal all heals all wounds time also causes them can I look to the future if I expect positive outcomes my friend if you are expecting you're already in the future you can't have an expectation about the present you can only have an expectation of the future that is the definition of an expectation for those of you that are asking about executive dysfunction and efficiency check out Dr K's guide to ADHD and doing stuff we'll teach you how to do stuff I hope you can read this but have you ever heard about emotional numbness absolutely check out videos on Alexia which we'll talk about in a second and um yeah we're probably going to do something specifically around trauma soon so can it be both so let's understand how time can heal all wounds so in this text that we talked about earlier banali yoga sutras the first sentence or actually maybe the second sentence is yog which means yoga is the sensation of fluctuations of the Mind so this is what a lot of people miss the nature of mind is impermanent so no feelings last forever we may think oh my god I've been guilty for 15 years and it'll never go away not actually how it works explain why in a second so the nature of the mind is that it changes this is why we get bored because the mind can't sit on one thing it needs something new I'm bored give me something else the other thing about the nature of mind so if we think about a fluctuation so there's a still mind and then there's a fluctuation what is a fluctuation it could be a sensory input I see something I smell something delicious cooking now I'm hungry it could be a memory right so now my mind is thinking about this thing it could be an emotion but the nature of emotions is that they don't last forever so the mind also returns to homeostasis this is the sensation of the fluctuation of the mind and you may say but what about emotional let's think about that right so how long does the happiness of your wedding day last groomzilla and bridezilla want the perfect wedding so I can have my perfect day of happiness and if you have your perfect day of Happiness are you happy for the rest of your life no unfortunately not if you have a thrilling experience with a video game let's say we're about to lose and it's one V5 and I like come back and I'm going to like 5V one Rampage and like yeah GG last minute comeback wooo does that last forever once you have one comeback in a video game are you done playing the game because you're happy for the rest of your life no you actually need to play the game over and over and over again again to evoke that experience if it was permanent you would only have to play the game once and you're done GG I'm out games have figured this out nothing in the mind is permanent so we're going to get people to keep playing and this is what our life becomes since nothing in the mind is permanent we have to chase the same crap over and over and over again to get the same result in the mind got to get high today got to get high tomorrow got to get high the next day got to get high twice on Friday three times on Saturday twice on Sunday but man I wish it was three times got to queue up again got to find a new game got to do more more more this sandwich is good I need to find a better sandwich so the nature of the mind is that it's fluctuate and so how does time heal all wounds because if the Mind returns to homeostasis and nothing is permanent if we have a wound in the mind it will return to homeostasis and this is what we see studies on genocide show that populations who experience genocide not everyone even gets diagnosed with PTSD some people are resilient and actually come back to normal and live healthy normal lives that's kind of wild it's the nature of the mind to return to the present That's How Time Heals all wounds now how does time cause alls because it it is in that dimension of time that the Mind suffers so when you enjoy something in the moment it's chill in fact your mind shuts off I learned this the most powerfully when I was walking on the beach one day I was walking splashing in in the waves and I was watching a Sunset and it was like a perfect moment holding hands with my wife my wife is pregnant with our first kid was quite pregnant we know that hell is going to break loose pretty soon baby's coming soon and then it's like game is over life is over but in that moment it was a perfect moment and it was just perfect for me anyway she was like eight months pregnant so she may have had difficulty and then our mind adds the dimension of time if I start thinking about the future and how I won't be able to do this again it destroys the moment if I start worrying about the past it destroys the moment literally when people are filled with regret and shame and guilt with negative self- attitude in depression food becomes tasteless life feels empty I've been dumped I can't taste food in grief I become anhedonic the food is the same what's changed is your capacity to taste it and no one says food is tasteless when they're like chilling in the moment everyone says food is tasteless when their mind is filled with regret or worry I can't relax why not because I'm worried about the future you can't be worried about the present you're worried about the future the only place that worries exist the nature of a worry is that is a thing that has not happened yet that's the definition of a worry the definition requires the dimension of time and so with all this meditation crap what are they trying to do they're trying to teach you to come to the present and once you start coming to the present you get good at it then you become peaceful and what's kind of wild is like this is why people with meditation can handle hardship I was in the o one day op ating room as a third-year medical student and one of the surgeons got pissed at me for many of my colleagues that would send them into a tail spin because my colleagues are like people who are straight A students I like man this guy's an [ __ ] that ain't on me right what's happening in this moment if the dude gives me a bad grade he gives me a bad grade I didn't do anything wrong I can't actually do anything about that right it's kind of weird oh but you're going to get a bad if I get a bad grade I get a bad grade iron is I got honors in the rotation one of his colleagues triying to convince me to be a surgeon because they realized that I wasn't doing anything wrong but we get so bent out of shape about crap that is out of our control in the future if I get a bad grade I get a bad grade what am I going to get kicked out of school no in the present do what you can focus on the present you can't get get an A on a test but you can study today and if you never study today you're not going to get an A on the test or maybe you will maybe you will walk in and your answer sheet gets mixed up with someone else's answer sheet and you end up getting an A so learn to live in the present how do you do that you can start by meditating but practically it's just like be where you are right now right because if you think of the thing is we avoid the present because we think it's painful but most the pain that actually happens in our mind is not from the present it's actually from the future and from the past because even if you think about it you you all may say but no Dr K I hate studying what does hating studying actually look like in the mind it's not the present I give you a hint oh my God it's been 15 minutes and I've only read one page I have 47 pages to go that's what hating studying looks like it's the future oh my god I've studied for three hours and I don't even remember what I studied in hour one that's what hating studying looks like I'm not saying it's easy and it can be uncomfortable right cuz getting your mind to sit in the Pres because mine doesn't like sitting in the present so mind is like oh this is boring I want to be doing something else I want to dot dot dot now it's moving to the future again so I'll give you all an example of like how studying works when you're in the present yal MX plus b when you actually try to understand that how is it that yal MX plus P why is is there a plus b instead of a minus B why is it yal MX why isn't it ax equals or a y equal m plus b when you ask those questions you're actually learning and when you're actually learning it's interesting it's kind of like weird how does that work but you're not when you're thinking why or how does this work you're looking at it you're not thinking about the future and you're not thinking about the past right all right we've got time for maybe a couple questions and then we got a wrap yeah so you know there's one thing there's one big shortcoming of this whole philosophy that I haven't been able to conquer and that is nausea so here I was thinking like oh my god I've discovered pain comes from the past and regret and suffering comes from the future and anxiety you cannot suffer in the present you can suffer in the future and you can suffer in the past you can do not be anxious in the present the anxiety is about what your future and then I got a stomach bug and I started vomiting and I vomited so much and I was sitting there and I used all of my yoga training cuz my stomach was terrible and I felt nauseous and I was like I've learned the yogic secret suffering is in the future I didn't give a crap about vomiting 5 minutes from now I was like this is terrible I wish this would go away I can't wait until I get to the Future please Future come now I don't know man and I'm sure there's an enlightened person out there who maybe knows the answer to that question I couldn't detach from it and even when I work with patients with anxiety things I I will teach them or like I will teach you the secret I'm Dr Kay come learn the secret of anxiety which is in the future and then they have a [ __ ] panic attack they're like I feel like I'm I'm I'm dying are you worried about dying no I conquered that part it just feels like my my heart is going to stop beating my heart is sending me signals that get activated when people are dying and my brain is getting the signals I know it's a panic attack I'm not worried about the future Dr K I'm getting the signals that I'm dying and they hurt I'm like yeah I don't know what to do about that but by all means y'all play around with it and figure it out for me and if I figure it out I'll let y'all know so one good point so inverted Goblin is saying actual vomiting is all in the present just like orgasms that is why orgasms part of the reason they feel so good so if you read these yogic texts they'll say that there are two things that naturally bring the Mind perfectly to the present and one of them is orgasm I was advertised a segment on sexy talk okay maybe one day I'm sick right now which is I guess good but okay you guys want the rules of sexy talk okay so I'll see how many I can come up with right now so rule number one a lot of people think about about talking dirty so people think that okay talking dirty is sometimes creepy right so we'll see like these text messages of like oo woo right and it's like oh I've got like a throbbing whatever like a hard whatever a wet whatever or whatever you know like some some some combination of variables it's not that and sometimes people find that arousing and other times people think it's creepy okay and then everyone talks about boundaries and and things like that and and all that kind of stuff which is good and all that but let's understand like the first most basic rule anytime you're doing dirty talk you want to convey that you find this person arousing so sometimes when people do dirty talk they talk about their own pleasure or they say say things that they find arousing right like the oooo crowd but you're not thinking about the other person you're thinking about yourself and so even if you use the same sentences who are you thinking about when you talk so if you say to the other person I am aroused does that turn you on or does that turn them on and then you may say Well they're not interested in arousing me then don't dirty talk them for [ __ ] sake that's the key thing about Dirty Talk they have to want to arouse you and then you start start saying things and then you're like but how do I get them how do I get them there you can't get them there then don't do the dirty talk okay so dirty talk is for their benefit not your benefit right that's like rule number one so think about the other person and this is where like but I don't know what they like so that's why you got to Pilot a couple of things right some people like you got to figure out like what threshold of word to use and so you can suggest more and you can like you gradually want to start with suggestive like you can even say something like here's a simple input right I can't wait to see you I've been thinking about you all day so early stage you want to say that you don't want to stay at at the end right if you're in the middle of the act or towards the end you don't want to say I've been thinking about you all day because then the person is going to be like what have you been thinking you should be thinking about like what are you you know can't say so you start off with like suggestive what is that's not even dirty and that's the point and then you see how they respond right if they're playful they'll say what have you been thinking and if they're playful and they're aggressive then you're like I can't get it out of my mind but I'm embarrassed by it right and then it's like and then you want to pull them in a little bit oh what are you thinking that's so embarrassing tell me more like 99% of the time that's the answer you're going to get and now they're inviting you you get what I'm saying you don't want to come out with it you lead them into it right and Cody bent is saying who needs a good spanking that's not what you say yall get that so start suggestively and suggestively doesn't mean you know something involving genitals anyway and then there's there's a progression which I I'm not prepared for in the moment but that's like step one and two okay like you'll get the principles there right and it's not like offensive because if the person isn't interested in you or they're like you know you like you shock them a little bit you're also like so let's say that they're interested in you so then you know they'll they'll be like what have you been thinking cuz now they've made you uncomfortable now that they've made you uncomfortable they're in control if they're in control they can be safe if they can be safe they can sort of accelerate or you know put the brakes on what have you been thinking now you have me intrigued and then it's like well look honestly get one or two drinks in me and then maybe you'll find out and it's like bam son good job right because they'll say okay when and where or they'll say yeah I don't think that's going to happen you're like cool sorry I brought it up and then you back out or if you're embarrassment is kind of a turnoff for them you know they'll like they'll take a step back you kind of got to get a feel for where they are and that's that's the whole point is like you don't want to you know push things that's when you become creepy it's it's all it's about really about communication the biggest problem with dirty talk is everyone's like it's something I'm going to do to you no it's not something you do to someone it's something you do with someone it's communication it's empathy it's paying attention to their signals right it's not just like first do this then do this then do this then do this you have to understand what the principle is we want to open up with an appetizer and even before the appetizer we want to open up with an Amo B and after that appetizer we're going to move on to the main course anyway this one day not today start with that [Music] anyway I love y'all lots of hugs all around right yeah y'all will know what dessert is dessert is when you've been satisfied by the full entree and then you do something that makes them feel even better so you can do some kind of you know fix some something to eat cuddle maybe a massage ask them hey can I make you a cup of hot tea and read you Harry Potter book four well we don't do that anymore because I think you know the cancelling of Harry Potter you want me to read you a story you want a bedtime story and like that's how works well right it doesn't end with orgasm that's the other big mistake that people get it's like orgasms like GG yeah everyone talks about seconds right and that's where it's like like intimacy is more than sex Aftercare is op the cancelling the calling them of the Uber people think that Alphas will call Ubers after you're done having sex but the alpha doesn't call an Uber the alpha calls Uber Eats um himadri sheer ganguli I'm not quite sure but if you've had an acute issue where you're like struggling to be normal like normalize then I'd say Seek a mental health evaluation right so there's this thing called something called adjustment disorder which is sort of how we describe people who aren't mentally ill but are just dealing with hard things it could be something in that realm but you probably shouldn't see someone um I guess there's a time delay on chat because y'all seem to be reacting to now this guy knows how to get women pregnant okay to be clear chat I've only gotten one
