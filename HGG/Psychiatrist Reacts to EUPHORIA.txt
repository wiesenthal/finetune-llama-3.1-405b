how do you manage your emotions you must become adapt at managing your emotions what happened is there were people who were addicted to substances and they leaned into oftentimes nowadays christian ideology and they found that that christian ideology was very very helpful so it's kind of weird because if you look at alcoholics anonymous what they'll start with is that i'm powerless in the face of my addiction and that there's a higher power and only through the grace of that higher power can i overcome this addiction and that sounds kind of like weird right so like if you're admitting powerlessness how is that a winning move when it comes to addiction an addiction hijacks your power right like that's how the addiction thrives the addiction tells you don't worry about it we got this we can handle it you'll be okay they won't find out [Music] what we're gonna do is talk about euphoria so for those of you that don't know euphoria is a tv show um on hbo and it centers around a lot of like substance use and things that make people euphoric and what i really like about it is that it really captures i think a lot of what mental health and mental illness looks and feels like so i think the challenge with like clinical approaches to mental health is that we don't really capture what the experience of some of these things is so we'll have like you know we'll have these diagnostic criteria like if you check five out of nine you know boxes for a particular for depression then you have major depressive disorder like if you have trouble sleeping if you've had a weight change if you're an hedonic which means you have difficulty getting pleasure from things if you're suicidal if you feel restless they're all these like categories right and so we kind of like check them and it's very scientific and it's very clinical but i think the challenge is that if we look especially at psychiatry like psychiatry is not as scientific as other disciplines of medicine so it's very scientific i don't mean to mean say that it's not scientific but it's not as like materialistic i should say it's probably as a better term so like psychiatry is a lot more like lived right so it's not like i can biopsy you and diagnose you with depression i can do surgery and remove a piece of something that will take away your depression that's not how it works so depression or addictions which we're going to be focusing on today is such a huge part of like who we are as people and not just who we are as people but the people we surround ourselves with as well as like the society that we grow up in and so what i really liked about euphoria is that it really captures how entangled addiction is with every dimension of someone's life so addiction is sure there's a genetic vulnerability but there's also like if i have existential dread about my future how do i manage those feelings and as we'll see they even sort of touch on psychoanalytic theory based on you know psychoanalysts that were writing books about this like 100 or over 100 years ago so a lot of interesting concepts about psychoanalytic theory genetics circumstances peer pressure and just what drugs do for us and and why we use them how they manage our how they impact our social relationships so just the thing my experience as an addiction clinician has been that addictions can permeate every element of your life who you hang out with how you manage your emotions your family relationships your success your in like your difficulty with dealing with the uncertain certainty of the world and i think it really captures all of those things so let's kind of like dig in to euphoria and specifically like what i'm going to talk about today we're just going to focus on the first 20 minutes of the show and the cool thing about the first 20 minutes of the show is you're going to learn so much about mental health and how people navigate mental health in a very like um what's the right word in a non-clinical way because mental health and mental illness is so much more than just like the clinical diagnosis and treatment and that's what i really think is great so we're gonna learn kind of everything you need to know about mental health in 20 minutes okay so let's start with this okay so it's kind of interesting so the show starts off so there's gonna be spoilers by the way but not too many spoilers it'll be like the first 20 minutes so it's kind of interesting so the show actually starts off with this image and it starts off with like this fetus presumably rue who's kind of the protagonist being in the womb right and what happens when we're in the womb is we're content so if we think a little bit about like the womb right so the womb is like a place where we have an umbilical cord that's connected to our parent our parent our mother usually and that umbilical cord kind of supplies us with everything that we need so all of our waste products like all of our the results of cellular metabolism are sent out through the umbilical cord all of our glucose our fats are our everything that we need even hormones and things like that are sort of transmitted through the umbilical cord where we're very protected in this environment so we're filled the the uterus is filled with something called amniotic fluid and the amniotic fluid like protects us from things like bumps right so if if i'm if my mother is walking down the street and and the pavement is kind of rocky the amniotic fluid is going to protect me against vibration it's going to protect me against sound it's going to protect me against everything and so what sort of people realize is that like the womb is sort of the perfect environment right it's dark it's just kind of filled with relative contentment and the interesting thing is that even like psychoanalysts a hundred years ago were talking about that and there was a guy named otto rank who basically posited that the first major traumatic experience that all human beings go through is birth so prior to birth we're perfectly content right and like we don't have any needs there's nothing wrong in the world because we're not even aware of what we are but all of our needs are getting met and the second that we were born suddenly like something drastic changes right so we're not this is where things kind of like evolve into discomfort so all of our needs are met and then when we're born suddenly like we're capable of feeling cold we're capable of feeling hungry we're capable of feeling alone we're capable of feeling frightened suddenly like all of these things change like we're not perfectly protected in a temperature stable environment sites can be scary lights can be bright sounds can disturb our rest whereas in the womb none of these things happen so otto rank sort of showed up and he kind of hypothesized that the most basic trauma that human beings experience is the process of being born and there's some interesting physiologic kind of connotations to this so for example when children are born they have spikes of cortisol so cortisol is a stress hormone and literally that cortisol helps with things like lung maturity so even the process of being born the stressful experience and all the crying that you experience has a physiologic effect of boosting your cortisol level and that boosting of your cortisol level actually helps our lungs understand hey we need to start breathing and prepare some prepares our lungs for breathing which is why if we have premature babies sometimes what we'll do is we'll have to use cortisol injections to prepare them for birth and like being able to optimize optimally survive in the external world so there was a there are a lot of other interesting psycho analytic theories about birth trauma so people sort of posited that the most basic form of anxiety or discomfort happens during birth trauma so there was another analyst named beyond bayern i'm not quite sure how to pronounce it bion who basically talked about how the basic imprint of anxiety and trauma is like through birth trauma so what he sort of noted was that as we look at as we're born if you think about the the the infant brain within hours of birth or even days or weeks of birth we don't really like have the capacity to understand what's going on we don't even understand like what emotions are all we have are these raw unfiltered experiences so in this infant brain like you just you just feel hungry right and you don't even know what hungry is all you know is that there are all these signals that are working their way through your body that make you feel discontent and you have no control like you can't you don't understand what's going on you feel bad you don't even know in what way things are bad and you're completely at the mercy of the world right do you get fed or do you not get fed you get cold do you get changed do you get warmed up do you get do they put a beanie on your head do they not put a beanie on your head so it's kind of this unfiltered roller coaster of negative experience followed by contentment hopefully in which you kind of like get milk drunk and you pass out and then you wake up again and you're hungry and then you're back to this like unfiltered state of discomfort and so this was very very fundamentally analysts sort of believe that this is incredibly traumatic and lays the foundation on a very core level of anxiety and so if we think about what anxiety is anxiety is like worry about the future right what if things don't work out what if and if we think a little bit about how does the human brain learn to fear the future how does it learn to be anxious it's through this birthing process or at least that's the theory that these people would posit right that suddenly now you're in this world where like you don't know how long the contentment is gonna last and you're just getting bodied by all of these weird sensations you know frustration being hungry needing to get changed feeling uncomfortable feeling afraid but you don't even know what those are so those experiences when sort of put into the fetal mind or the infant mind are just so incredibly traumatic because there's no way to process them there are also like you know criticisms or other perspectives on this but i think it's really interesting that the show essentially talks about this contentment as the beginning of things now the interesting thing is that if you look at a lot of this traumatic birth kind of stuff what they sort of talk a little bit about is the way that children learn to navigate this in a healthy way or unhealthy way the way that we learn that anxiety is to be feared above all else or the way that our anxiety gets reassured is actually through our original like maternal parent or paternal bonding so when children are born they bond and this show also is kind of really interesting because they talk a little bit about um this the state into which the main character was born so the main character i think was born right around 9 11 and so they talk a little bit about how their parents for the first 48 hours of their life were just watching stuff related to the twin towers and the terrorist attacks and this kind of makes me wonder because like you know this sort of bonding that happens between children and parents is so important and so what happens to a child who is bonding with a mother or father who are like concerned about 9 11 right so the world was shocked people are grieving people are like worried there's a lot of uncertainty in the world people like sort of think the world is going to end you know it's very very shocking and if if the parents are sort of for 48 hours sitting in a hospital room where they're obsessing over 9 11 what impact does that have on maternal child bonding right because the interesting thing to remember is that children when we're born we don't really have logic we don't have really emotional awareness we have no way of communicating or understanding other people all children have is empathy right so like the most important circuit the most important way to communicate and interact with a child is empathy so parents sort of develop a feeling for okay is this kid doing okay is it that's not doing okay and similarly kids will be exquisitely sensitive to the moods of their parents and for those of you that sort of grew up in households where unfortunately you experienced some amount of abuse or maybe like drinking in the house you'll you'll remember that you were exquisitely sensitive to your parents moods so we've had people that we've interviewed and you know this is not just people we've interviewed here but this is my experience as a clinician you know if you talk to kids who grew up in abusive households they know within seconds of seeing the parent whether they're in trouble that day or not they they're exquisitely sensitive to the mood of others and so it starts to beg the question like if we grow up in a particular situation where our parents are grieving our parents are paranoid our parents are concerned what does that do to the anxiety that was laid down by our birth trauma and this is where it's kind of interesting because from the get-go we can explore things like attachment theory so attachment theory is this idea that how we relate to other human beings depends on something called attachment and so whether we have secure attachment or anxious attachment or avoidant attachment or fearful attachment the way that we fundamentally relate to other human beings gets kind of determined very early on so let's explain this a little bit because this is important for for drug addiction as well so when i'm a kid i don't really understand the world right like the world sort of doesn't make sense to me so the most important thing that reassures me the way i fundamentally get my internal anxiety about the world re being reassured or not is the consistency of the world around me so for example if you think about a child who becomes confident with gravity right so like if i have a three-year-old a three-year-old is like happy to jump off of sofas you know jump onto things roll around jump around jump on a trampoline they're happy to throw balls pick up balls even one-year-olds will like pick up food and like drop it on the ground right so like kids are confident when it comes to gravity and why are kids so damn confident when it comes to gravity even to the point where parents are like you know have to you have to really watch your kid because they'll do things that are unsafe when it comes to gravity they'll jump off of things they'll jump into things like you have to be really careful about kids right where does that confidence with gravity come come from it comes from consistency so the cool thing about gravity is gravity doesn't have moods right like gravity isn't happy one moment in pissed one moment gravity isn't sober one moment and like drunk the next moment so consistency of parenting is what leads to confidence in the child the second aspect of of attachment theory that's really really important is emotional mirroring which is related to that consistency so the other thing to remember is that a one-year-old doesn't know what they're feeling so how does a one-year-old understand what they're feeling what they actually do is look at the facial expressions of the people around them so when a one-year-old gets hurt what do other adults do they pick up the child and they're like oh a poor baby with a baby is what to baby okay are you all right with the baby right so as we do that kind of thing we sort of like we show the child what they should be feeling and so they understand what anger is because if they're upset you know maybe we're gonna have to discipline them if they're acting out and angry a child may have to be disciplinary if the child is hurt and falls down a parent will like pick them up and cuddle them and be like oh it's okay baby it's okay and then the other thing that happens is positive reinforcement is also emotionally mirrored in like a greater way so let's think a little bit about you know when the kid draws something that is illegible and they bring it to you with pride they're like look daddy like look at this weird thing that i drew and as you show the weird thing that you drew the parents are like oh my god that's amazing look at that what is that by the way i can't really tell so what we tend to see with kids and early on is that if parents respond to them consistently in an emotionally mirroring and supportive way those children become securely attached they become confident about the world and the reason they're confident about the world is because the world makes sense right and you compare that to um you know children who grow up with inconsistent caregiving so this is like a good example of we'll kind of talk about a couple of these examples so what we tend to find is that you know people who are secure have low avoidance and low anxiety right so they're like willing to engage they're willing to try new things they're not like they have confidence in themselves and then we also have like an anxious attachment which is like when people are are very very high anxiety um but they're also they may be willing to engage with other people so this comes from sort of inconsistent parenting and then you'll also have like avoid an attachment so i think avoidant attachments are very very classically common in terms of men who have difficulty forming strong emotional bonds so in avoidant attachments what sometimes will happen is you'll have a child that shares their emotional needs which are not met by the parent and so then what happens is the the the child starts to resent the parent for not meeting our emotional needs and then they avoid the parent altogether so this is the kind of thing where if like if i share emotional vulnerability and you don't meet me where i'm at then i'm gonna start resenting you and then what i'm gonna learn is to be fiercely independent right because like the lesson that i learned is if i share my emotional needs with people and they don't they don't meet them then like i can't rely on people so it doesn't necessarily make me anxious but it keeps me like separated from other people so these are people who have struggled to form connections and if we kind of think about it it's almost like a protective model where people with avoidant attachment styles will be like very very careful about you know what kind of relationships they form because they're afraid that like if i am vulnerable with you like what's gonna happen i don't know so the best thing to do is not be emotionally vulnerable to begin with so there are some interesting experiments that kind of go into this my point here is that generally speaking you know this is protective against drugs and these three are not protective against drugs and the cool thing about the show is that the show has different attachment styles that you'll see with different characters that all relate to substance use in some different way okay but the key thing here is that if we're talking about the show like i don't know what impact you know growing up with 911 has on attachment now this doesn't you also have to be careful i'm kind of over generalizing here because you know there are all kinds of kids that grew up after 9 11 that have good and secure attachment who are alive today so you can't really draw that one-to-one correlation but it just sort of makes me wonder a little bit because if we kind of look at the show the show really emphasizes some of these concepts right and like even in this is the first two minutes of the show or 160 seconds 90 seconds of the show where they kind of talk about the hand that rue was dealt when rue came into the world and that's something that i think is really really important to think about in terms of addictions so we tend to think about addictions as diagnoses right and we talk about brain stuff and neurotransmitters and genetic vulnerabilities but the truth is there's a lot of really core stuff involving addictions that i think the show really sets up very well next up now this is fantastic so what happens next in the show right so this is actually before we kind of get to this i want to talk about one other thing so the other challenge right now that we tend to see i think with substance use is that if you really look at it objectively this is this show sort of shows okay 9 11 happened roo grew up in this kind of situation it she grew up sort of in a world of fear right so in the first 10 years of her life for those of you in the u.s like you remember what the not post 9 11 world was right was like right so we went to war is the united states there was an emphasis on terror the department of homeland security was created there was a lot of like racism there was a lot of discrimination that happened and so like we kind of grew up with this like once in a lifetime event i think if you look at substance use right so we're seeing that substance use is generally speaking getting worse or not just substance use let's just talk about addiction as a whole so it's not just like chemical addictions which are getting worse for all kinds of reasons so some of the reasons that chemical addictions are getting worse substances are getting worse it's all kind of fascinating stuff so the first is that we've been breeding stuff to be more addictive so if you look at the potency of marijuana the potency of marijuana has increased drastically over the last like 40 years right so people have been like breeding stronger and stronger strains and that doesn't even include the synthetics so the other thing that we started doing is getting very very creative with what kind of synthetic substances will make so there's like native american you know spirits journey journeys that involve ayahuasca and now we've isolated dmt and people will take dmt and they'll take different metabol i mean a different kind of chemical modifications of dmt and so what we're seeing from addictions is that like drugs are getting stronger they're getting more potent they're also becoming more nuanced so this is where we'll get get into this in a little bit but when you get into addiction you know people have a drug of choice right so some people will really get addicted to one substance over a different substance and why is that it's because their neurochemistry the way their brain is wired is just a little bit different there's studies that show that you know the dopaminergic or reward response that a particular addict gets from alcohol will be different from what they get from marijuana whereas another person may get a huge response from marijuana and very little from alcohol now what you do is you take a world where we have all these different kinds of drugs right so it's not just one type of drug it's not just marijuana now you have sativa blends and you have indica blends you have cbd heavy stuff and you have thc heavy stuff not to mention all of the different kinds of synthetic marijuanas like k2 for example which is highly psychotic and like doesn't really calm people down it's like the opposite of cbd where people it gives people very very powerful experiences but also makes them like kind of crazy when i was in residency so a huge disclaimer by the way like don't do drugs kids and this is a really really good example of this so when i was in residency in massachusetts you know people would use k2 and like they would get really really messed up like mess themselves up permanently and it just messes you up so bad and what we're seeing right now in substance use is that as we make five or ten different variants of drugs what we're essentially doing is selecting for all of the different variants right so if you start using drugs and you try out five different variants of marijuana you may be able to find the perfect marijuana blend for you which we'll get to in a second in terms of why people use it but then what that actually does is opens you up to more addictive potential and more possibility to like really screw up your life so you got to be careful about that stuff but the other thing that the show kind of highlights if we kind of think about it is some of this stuff about you know tragedy in the world so if we think a little bit about what environment rue grew up in she grew up in the post 9 11 dru post 9 11 world and this is the interesting thing about growing up in this generation not uh talking about gen z so mostly all who are listening to this is that we've had like four once in a lifetime crises within 20 years right it's kind of wild like if you think about you know what we what this generation has had to deal with it's been like thing after thing after thing after thing and if we talk we'll get into this a little bit more but if we talk a little bit about what predisposes us to drug use okay what we're gonna find is that like you know this is the happy and content world and then you get born into a world but what kind of world do you get born into do you get born into a world that's like post 911 and then like you know after 9 11 we had the 2007-2008 you know economic crash at least in the united states and so that was like a once-in-a-lifetime black swan unpredictable economic crisis and then we've got like climate change right so the world is like it's a little bit unclear whether the world will just straight up end at some point right whether there's some kind of catastrophic collapse to our ocean system if there's a catastrophic collapse to our ocean system and like all the algae dies that's what actually produces like traps the most greenhouse gases right algae like or carbon fixers so they take co2 out of the environment they produce oxygen and then like if they die like you know the fish die and all that kind of stuff we could see a catastrophic collapse to the world like we could be like literally like apocalyptic kind of times right and no one really knows whether this is going to happen or not happen some people think we're overblowing the risks other people think that this is we're definitely on the path to destroy ourselves within 100 years i don't really know i've looked at a lot of science it concerns me but it's not my area of expertise the point here what we are focused on is not whether the world is going to end or not but growing up in a society where there's like a lot of very strong scientific evidence that we're on the path to screwing ourselves right there's economic crises there's climate change there's stuff like 911 and by the way there's also this global pandemic which basically shut down the world for two years right and like the human rights related stuff that's happening with covet as well like there's all kinds of stuff going on and this is the the problem is that like what is that doing to our psychology what is it like to be a 20 year old kid existing in the world today and there's a counter argument here as well where you can say that well like humanity on the whole has gotten a lot better and like there's definitely an argument for that right so if you look at medical advancement like it's pretty cool that you know we've basically eliminated polio through vaccines we've basically we can catch we've essentially eliminated cervical cancer or reduced cervical cancer drastically through the hpv vaccine so that's huge right people are dying of cervical cancer like i remember in culturally and like religiously kind of the same thing you don't name a kid until they're like 30 days old in several cultures right why is that like why don't we why don't even we even give kids names it's because infant mortality used to be through the roof now people think about their kids names before even they're pregnant like we take it for granted that our children will survive right which is that is an assumption that human beings didn't have a hundred years ago so there's absolutely been progress like there's no question about that right so we've got like solar panels like that's pretty cool we've got electric cars like that's pretty cool we've got technology and video games and virtual reality and medicine is improving that's pretty cool we're in the days of like uber and uber eats and we we have so much cultural exchange like i can watch a korean soap opera if i want to like that's pretty cool so life has definitely gotten better by a lot of objective measures as well but when we think about the psychology of what it's like to grow up in the world today we get bombarded by like some really really scary stuff and what do we do about that right what do we how do we manage that like it's like okay so you're telling me i have to go to college right and the reason i need to go to college is so that i can get a good job the reason i can get a good job is so that i can be financially independent and then presumably get married and have kids and all this kind of stuff but like what if the world ends in 20 years i've had several patients talk to me about they're afraid to have children and it's like why is that well it's like i don't want to bring a child into a world that's like apocalyptic because the the climate is collapsing and then like human beings die like that's terrible like i don't want to do that i've had patients who talk about the anxiety and concern about bringing children into this world which i'm sure to some degree has always been there right so every generation is concerned about the world ending like in the next hundred years i'm sure that there are people who sort of do that but are concerned about that but i really think that our exposure to this kind of information the volume at which we get it because it's always one disaster after another right which is has something to do with the internet in the way that we consume information the way that information floats to the top so what information floats to the top the information that is emotionally charged that's what we react to and so what ends up happening is we see the most emotionally charged stuff from all over the world day after day after day after day and what impact does that have on our psychology well it's like okay i've got a choice between this or this and this is what i want right i want to go back to the womb where like there was no sense of you know things are going to hell in the womb in fact everything was perfectly content okay so now you get kids who are growing up with some amount of existential dread and this is where things are gonna get a little bit tricky so then what happens is like you'll get some kids right and here's the thing kids are unique not all kids are the same i don't know if you guys can kind of see this one but she's just she's counting up here so she's just like counting things on the ceiling and then the parents like look at the kid and they're like wait a minute i don't understand what my kid is doing so i want you to think a little bit about you know if roo was born 200 years ago and she was counting objects right maybe a little bit of like obsessive-compulsive tendencies what would a parent do a parent would be like i don't really know what's up right we didn't have answers for everything back then but now living in the information age it's very subtle but we look at something and we see a kid and we don't understand what they're doing they're maybe a little bit unique it's a little bit of a strange behavior and then like the parent is like okay what is going on because there's sort of this assumption that there is an answer out there and i don't know if that makes sense to y'all but like 100 years ago you know there wasn't wikipedia like we didn't have answers at our fingertips in fact like most human beings like didn't really have answers to stuff which is why religion used to be so big so religion would give us some vague sense oh this is just like god makes each and every one of us in in a particular unique way okay period right is rue really doing anything that's problematic in this scene like no she's just like counting stuff maybe a little bit distracted from her dinner like maybe that's you know there's just something like a little bit weird like our kid is doing something that's a little bit sus completely normal but nowadays we need answers for everything right because we've grown up with the assumption that there are answers for everything there's a reason i'm doing this there's a reason my kid is that way and what's even more terrifying is if you're a parent what if you're like messing up right so you want to be a good parent and your kid is doing something that you don't understand so what do you do if your kid starts doing things that you don't understand you can't let uncertainty be a part of it because what if you screw up what if you're missing something what if something is going on because everyone's talking about mental illness what do we do we take him to see a psychiatrist right we're like oh i don't understand what's going on here so let me go take my child to get help and so now we get into the bucket of pediatric diagnosis and this show i think does a good job of sort of sharing some of the frustrations with it the reality of it is that this would never happen in real life like this would never ever ever ever ever happen but i think it captures or is hyperbole for one of the points so this is where she gets diagnosed with ocd generalizing anxiety disorder adhd bipolar disorder but maybe she's a little bit too young we can't really tell there's also this sort of idea that we think that psychiatric diagnoses have to happen because of drastic negative things so she talks a little bit about like she wasn't physically abused or like didn't grow up grow up in like a situation where she didn't have clean water like there was nothing really traumatic right and so we sort of assumed that okay the kids who get psychiatrically diagnosed or kids that like grew up with traumatic situations like parents who are using iv heroin and that's how you get kind of mentally ill as a kid so there's kind of like a lot of really good things in this imagery where where essentially what happens is is we you know take people to psychiatrists they see something unusual and they like you know they go looking for a diagnosis and this is where there's kind of this funny sort of thing about medicine which is that if you take people if you if you take someone to a doctor that doctor will diagnose them with something right so this is kind of like a funny sort of scenario but a family member of mine about it 10 15 years ago was having a medical problem and what they did is they went and saw three specialists and each of the specialists gave them a different diagnosis they gave them a diagnosis from their specialty so i'll give you all like kind of a good example of this a simple example so there's now a condition called ibs which is irritable bowel syndrome so irritable irritable bowel syndrome is sort of like this non-specific condition where your bowels are kind of irritable like that's just what they are so sometimes you get diarrhea sometimes you get cramps sometimes you get constipation there's no like real blood in the stool biopsies don't really show anything lab tests are pretty non-specific it's not like you have an infection you know if you do a stool culture you're not going to grow out like parasites or anything like that but something's just like our bowels are just kind of messed up right so it's like you go to a gi doctor they'll diagnose you with ibs you go to a psychiatrist they'll diagnose you with generalized anxiety disorder because anxiety has stomach components with it so sometimes people with anxiety can get their bowels messed up right so you can get diarrhea and stuff like that you can go to an endocrinologist and they may diagnose you with something else so this is the kind of thing where if you like show up to a see a psychiatrist they're gonna do their job which is diagnose you with something and there's another like subtle problem here which is that people tend to get tacked on like diagnoses so you'll see this a lot unfortunately maybe you all have been through this as well whereas like you'll you'll get diagnosed with the first thing like you'll get diagnosed with anxiety generalized anxiety disorder you get started on a medication and then if something happens like let's say you have a traumatic breakup and then you end up feeling suicidal and you go to the hospital what the people at the hospital are gonna do they're gonna say okay you've got generalized anxiety disorder you're on medication for anxiety so and you're in the hospital so like there must be something else right because the the medication you're on is treating the anxiety so there's like another disorder that has been missed and since there's another disorder that has been missed because the anxiety was being treated by this let's tack on another diagnosis oh so now you have bipolar disorder and generalized anxiety disorder but it's really hard to go back and wipe away the generalized anxiety disorder because that's also where like as a clinician if you're diagnosing someone with bipolar disorder you don't know what the person who diagnosed them with generalized anxiety disorder saw right so you don't know if they were seeing bipolar and just misdiagnosed it or out of like your own humility you're like maybe they just saw anxiety and i can't see the anxiety because the bipolar is active right so it's like a really like i don't know if i'm missing y'all here if that's a little bit complicated but if there's like active bipolar disorder like that may drown out the generalized anxiety disorder so then as a clinician you're left kind of confused because you're like is this anxiety plus bipolar or was it bipolar all along well i don't know because i wasn't there i didn't see what that person saw so maybe that wasn't bipolar and then what happens is you like the safest thing to do because you don't want to like under diagnose right so like think about it you don't want to like take away generalized anxiety disorder from their chart if that's what they've got because then you're signing them up for suffering because now we're just treating generalized we're treating bipolar disorder and then their anxiety is now untreated and you're sending them out the door like setting them up to fail because you've taken away treatment that could be really helpful for them so what do you do you tack on bipolar and then something else happens another traumatic breakup right and then like they get sent back to the hospital because sometimes people get suicidal and then it's like well okay well hold on a second they've got anxiety they've got bipolar there are medications for both of these things that's not enough we're missing something else aha as we tunnel down further tunnel down further ah there's trauma so now you get tacked on a ptsd right and so what happens is we build up these diagnoses for people over time and you get diagnosed with this and this and this and this and in the show i mean there's there's no way that this would actually happen where like you know they're diagnosing a kid with like four things at the same time not gonna happen even people are not that negligent but i think the show does a good job of highlighting that this is what happens especially to like kids right where like we don't know what it is the parents are concerned so like it kind of fits some check boxes and this is a problem with psychiatric diagnosis because there's no biopsy there's no x-ray all we have are check boxes and i'm sure that y'all can understand that like i mean maybe maybe i'm taking this for granted but you know the check boxes for anxiety the check boxes for bipolar and the checkboxes of ocd can overlap quite a bit right like if i'm ocd and i'm not able to control things properly i'm gonna get really really anxious the experience of people with ocd is oftentimes anxiety because if you think about it like if i have ocd and i have to turn on the light on and off the light switch 15 times right before like and if i don't do that everyone in my household is going to die from a meteor strike that's literally the kinds of thoughts that people with ocd have what do you imagine my internal experience is going to be it's going to be anxiety so i i go to a psychiatrist and say i'm anxious all the time or my friends see me and they say oh you're like you're super anxious you need to relax and you go see a therapist and then you go to the therapist and you say hey and the therapist asks you like why are you here today and you're like well my friends think i'm super anxious so then i need to chill out and the therapist is like okay so tell me about your anxiety well i'm like worried that people like bad things are going to happen to people that i love okay tell me more about that now hopefully you have a competent clinician and the competent clinician actually assesses you for ocd which is what they're supposed to do but this is where like unfortunately we live in the real world where you know people get a certain amount of time for a diagnostic assessment sometimes clinicians are burnt out like and you just answer questions in a particular way and like you think you have anxiety and one of things you learn in medicine is that learn to trust the patient right honestly i'm not kidding so i've had like patients come in and you know they're like i'm afraid something's wrong with me and we do tests and stuff and we're like we don't think anything's wrong with you like something's wrong with me it's like okay like let's take that seriously let's do like more tests let's try to figure this out because patients know their bodies better than doctors do right so we listen to the patient so sometimes they get diagnosed with anxiety when really what they have is ocd and so they get treated for the anxiety but they don't get treated for the ocd and then later on a clinician comes along and then like assesses them for ocd and this is oh they've got ocd and then that clinician has the same problem now okay so i diagnose ocd but does that mean that the anxiety was the ocd or did this person see something else that is now being medicated and treated by this treatment so it's actually like generalized anxiety under control you all get that like it's really hard as a clinician so i'm not sort of blaming that i'm not blaming clinicians here but unfortunately like this is way too common where kids will like get diagnosed with one thing and another thing and another thing and we don't have biopsies to diagnose you with major depressive disorder or ocd and we sure as hell don't have x-rays to rule out psychiatric diagnoses so it is so hard to get a psychiatric diagnosis taken off of your chart right like it's like how do people know like we don't know fmri doesn't do it my friends sorry i'd love it if it did but it just doesn't do it okay so i think the show does a great job this is also like the first two minutes oh man so the next part is even worse okay so the most terrifying thing as a child is when your parent starts manically reassuring you for something that isn't wrong right so they're like like you're just a kid you're just you and then suddenly your parent shows up and says honey it's just the way that you're brought you were hardwired plenty of great intelligent funny and interesting people have what you have struggle with the same things you struggle with but like here's the thing i want you all to understand this this is not a struggle the kid is fine they're just counting right you'll get that like i'm not saying that the kid doesn't have ocd and doesn't need treatment and stuff like that but this is the other thing that tends to happen is that kids who get diagnosed with something they're not broken in some way like and that that maybe is a statement that i'll get in trouble for but i really as a psychiatrist i don't view that child as broken and these statements are true right like sometimes people are just wired differently but then it's like you're you're the kid and you're like what's going on like i'm confused i went and i saw the doctor and now i have to take these pills and there is mom with a huge smile on her face right look at how oh honey here take this medicine your brain is wired differently and there's nothing wrong with you you can be so successful lots of brilliant people who are just like you are hun and then like it confuses the hell out of the child they're like what is going on here i didn't think that i'm just counting yo i like to count it makes me feel good about myself and this is what parents do because parents it's not their fault because parents are terrified right when they see like look at this look at this facial expression right the parents are terrified they're terrified of all of these diagnoses what does this mean for my child oh my god i'm so scared i'm so scared i'm so scared and look at the kid the kid has no idea what's being said but what's the kid's facial expression kid is matching dad kid doesn't know what the hell is going on but they know it ain't good and then mom shows up with smiles hey everything's gonna be okay because the parent too the parent wants everything they're devastated parents devastated on the inside but we can't let the child be devastated we can't let them know that oh my god they're taking all these pills because they're crazy so we see this like false positivity that the parents are like oh like people have struggled with what you've struggled with right like you can be okay like everything's gonna be great like you're gonna be awesome there's nothing to worry about and the kid was like i'm just counting i wasn't worried to begin with i was okay right and so there's this this discrepancy between the way the parent feels and the way they act and that can really mess kids up so now it's like confused but there are a couple of other things that the kid learns right okay so if i feel bad maybe these are the antidote and then we get into this which is devastating so like it's so beautifully written so just that the world move moved fast and my brain moved slow right and so like what starts to happen when you when you get medicated is that like some of these medications so i don't know what this i don't know what these are but let's assume that they're started on a mood stabilizer you would we wouldn't do this all at once this is terrible no clinician would do this you get started on a mood stabilizer an ssri may be like some kind of anxiety anxiolytic medication and what are those going to do they're going to slow you down a little bit so the hardest thing that i've struggled with as a clinician is like my patients with bipolar disorder really really dislike the medicine some of the medicine anyway because they feel like it slows them down especially if they have a creative interest and this is really interesting but you know this statement this isn't wrong so a lot of like very funny interesting and creative people do have mood disorders and i call it something called the artistic temperament i've worked with a lot of people and i work really hard to really minimize their medication because the truth is that those experiences of depression or mania are what is what inspires these people to create their art it's like understanding the depths of despair and suicidality which then you put into a piece of art that is powerful and resonates with the community and like makes your art magnificent right and it's the price that we pay for being geniuses and like our mental kind of gets busted as a result or there's something there where i've just seen too many successful artists struggle with mental illness and and it's it's it's really hard but like i think that there's absolutely a way to kind of navigate that in a for forward and a healthy way the first is it helps the artists that i work with when i'll sort of share with them like i think you have the artistic temperament and they'll be like what is that it's like yeah we can diagnose you with something sure but i think that you need to understand that like this is what makes you great right these experiences that you have i understand they make you suffer we're not going to try to like let them go unchecked right and the real the real pathway forward is trying to figure out how we can act access that authentic suffering part of you and yet not let that part take over your life and my goal as a clinician when i work with people who have the artistic temperament is to somehow let them create art without sacrificing everything else because that's oftentimes what they have to do because they're like you know when they're when they're you know hypomanic and they're painting for 20 hours a day and they create this like life-affirming artwork it's like they're not paying their bills they're ruining their relationships they're losing custody of their kids and like that's not worth it or maybe it is it's not for me to say but as a clinician my job is to help you create that art while at the same time like helping you put together a life that is like stable and worth living and so this is the experience of people right that the world moved fast and my brain moves slow and then you find yourself like trying to outrun your anxiety and the truth is it's exhausting it's just exhausting that's the best word for it so now what happens is i want you all to think about this for a second so like you're a what 12 year old 13 year old kid you're in you're in middle school and like middle school is hard enough but if you have anxiety if you have medication everything becomes harder both of them make things harder right ideally i mean in a good clinical scenario you know i've seen this for kids as well where medication can be drastic and it just makes your life feel fantastic like you just it really fixes the problem and allows you to live life that's the purpose of medication right we want to use it to the point where it doesn't make your brain move slow it just makes it so that you don't have to outrun your anxiety like that's the goal of medication is to let your brain be calm so that you can enjoy life but oftentimes what we tend to see is that it makes life just exhausting you're outrunning your anxiety one moment you're struggling to understand math the next moment because you're on a mood stabilizer that slows your cognition a little bit right and that's just how you feel and so like this is your life like you forget about existential dread and all that crap which has been baked into this person from birth but life is just hard you're tired of it and so this is where we start to get into identity and so at some point you know this is the this is the scene in the movie where mom distrusts rue and rue basically smuggles fake urine in to dodge a drug test and this is this captures so much about what it's like to be an addict so the first thing that i want you to understand is that you know at some point your symptoms start to become you so at this point we have a diagnosis the diagnosis is separate from you and then it's the way our brain is wired and now you find yourself trying to outrun your anxiety right so there's still your anxiety and there's the you and at some point it becomes who you are so you become an addict it becomes the person that you are if i could be a different person i promise you i would they don't ask for this right rue didn't ask for this she didn't ask for this she didn't ask for this she didn't ask for this she didn't ask for this and she sure as hell didn't ask for that right and so we hate being addicts we wish we were different we wish we were so different right but this is where i think things get really challenging so the challenge is that like we're in this world that is full of existential dread our brain is hardwired a particular way we didn't ask for it we just kind of show up one day and i just showed up one day without a map or a compass or to be honest anyone capable of giving me an iota of good advice right and we have our mom who's like did you eat breakfast this morning and this i think is a consequence of this is i it's a it's a beautifully written set of dialogue because i i think it captures so much about what's wrong wrong with our world right now and what's going on is like rue is a person right that this is a whole person the problem is that what we've managed to do is separate out all of the aspects of the person so if you've got a disease go see a psychiatrist and take these pills and it'll fix that right like if you have body image issues like or peer pressure things like that that's something that the school should handle so the therapist should handle this the school should handle this the psychiatrist who's prescribing your medication is supposed to handle that remember those aren't even the same anymore and then the parent is supposed to make sure that you eat right but like who is supposed to help you with all of it because the psychiatrist isn't going to be asking about your diet your coach in gym class is not going to be asking about your medication and your mom is not going to ask you like it isn't like gonna help you with the existential dread right because mom is just worried about making sure you get your meds there's a you know like they're just gonna make sure that you're getting fed which is all they can handle there's another scene here where mom is like frustrated on the phone trying to figure out like how to get how to pay for rue's treatment right so mom's got a lot on her plate like i'm not really faulting her and this is the problem is that if we look at a human being like it's all of this stuff right it starts with here it starts with this it moves on to this moves on to this moves on to this moves on to this and like how do you who is going to help you with the fact that you're just exhausted as a 13 year old and the world is moving fast and you're moving slow and your brain is moving slow who's going to help you with the fact that you're trying to outrun your anxiety but you take it with you wherever you go so you never succeeds who's going to help you with all this like what am i supposed to do with my life how do i handle these feelings what does this mean for my future forget about the feelings like they're the therapist is talking to you about your feelings but like what is the therapist actually going to do about climate change because that's a valid fear right it's like sure i can go see a therapist because i'm depressed because i have crushing student loan debt u.s once again but like what is the therapist gonna do about that oh my god that must be so hard for you yeah you're damn right it's so hard for me like what are we gonna do about it and so like this is where we end up we don't know how to navigate life right and i'm not trying to to crap on therapy i'm just saying that their like therapists are great don't get me wrong it's just that therapists can't fix climate change and this is a real subtle problem which is that therapists can help you with cognitive distortions the problem is that the anxieties that you have may not be distortions you all get that like a lot of what we struggle with like half the problem the reason that mental health is getting so much worse is because these are not malfunctions of the brain people aren't like misinterpreting stuff this is actually what's going on if you look at things like grooming how old were you if you're a girl i guess applies to guys too but generally speaking i think about girls how old were you when you got your first dick pic right like that's a reality like you have to deal with that this is not a cognitive distortion it's not a malfunction of your mind right you guys get that like these are real problems that we don't we're not given advice or a compass or map right and we see like people like 9 to 13 shocking but that is like really consistent with most of the people that i've worked with right it's it's staggering how bad of a place the world can be and so this is beautifully said and at some point you make a choice about who you are and what you want right and this i assume is rue's mom right so we see that there's a genetic predisposition to anxiety that our mom uses xanax and you make a choice about who you are and what you want and you take a substance and everything you feel and wish and want to forget it all just sinks and then over time it's all i wanted those two seconds of nothingness and you're just so happy and thus is an addict born because for two seconds after you take this pill it's back to the womb and this is the interesting thing i was talking to you know there's one person that one patient that i really learned a lot from and you know it's kind of weird so i'm a psychiatrist sure i'm qualified and stuff like you know i've got good training behind me and i'm a medical doctor and all that good stuff but the truth of the matter is that if you really want to understand any addiction or any disease the psychiatrist is not the expert the patient is the expert and it's a patient that i was i was talking to a patient once and we'd gotten close right so i'd been working with them for a while and i was just stunned and i said you have such an amazing life you have such an amazing life you know you've got a career that i know you enjoy you've got a family that loves you and you know all this kind of stuff and you're throwing it away right so you're going through divorce proceedings you're now in debt you've like had one of your cars repossessed and things like that you had to sell off some stuff your children are being alienated from you why don't you stop using and then they blew my mind but they said it's because of that that i can't stop using because you're right that like my life is turning into a mess and every hour of every day my life is a mess except when i get high and so i have all i have to do is put a needle into my veins and like for a few hours like none of those all those things cease to exist right i'm just so happy in those two seconds of nothingness i'm just so happy and this is where i want to sort of take a let me just see where this is going let's see okay hold on okay so we're gonna talk for a second about what addiction does for people okay so these seconds of nothingness in which you're just so happy has a sanskrit word for it and that sanskrit word is samadhi samadhi is a temporary state of enlightenment where the ego dissolves you dissolve and all you are is unadulterated experience you're just sort of this weird like cosmic awareness which is also nothingness so keep in mind that drugs are not addictive so people talk about nothingness but they think it's like oblivion but it's not oblivion so remember that drugs don't put people to sleep that's not why they use them they keep people awake right like you want to stay awake when you use drugs because what it puts you into is a state of consciousness where you're beyond mind where you're beyond time and you're just existing in nothingness which sounds like kind of an oxymoron right like how can you exist in nothingness or the other way to call it is like it's like pure existence without like attachments so there's no like consequences to things right you can just appreciate the colors and everything that you wanted all of your wish wishes all of your desires all of your sufferings all of them disappear and this is what's so confusing for a lot of people who meditate as they're like i don't want to get rid of my desires right it's my desires that motivate me it's my desires that make me what i am it's my desires that make me happy but as people meditate and as they attain states of samadhi their desires begin to melt away and you don't know how to continue living if you until you've experienced it you don't know what that means for you and so you can appreciate things when you're high like colors and the taste of food and the feeling of wind on your skin and the other people that talk about experiencing this stuff are the yogis because they say oh look you know like just just be with just be you know enjoy transcend ego and so i think for a lot of people drugs are basically like a budget samadhi they're like a temporary shortcut to bring you to a place where like the yogis like buddha has been trying to teach people how to do this for thousands of years and then like here's the problem is that your brain is like okay so i can do hardcore meditation for 15 years and maybe i'll get to this state because remember when you start to meditate you don't know what this feels like right so like this is all a myth to you it's a hope it's like telling someone that you know sail to the end of the ocean and you'll you know the world is round and like you won't fall off it's faith but you have to embark on that very very long voyage on faith and you have no idea what you're going to be getting at the end of it and then what you have is you've got a pill that can bring you there it's so much easier like why bother meditating when you can get high like because it's so immediate it's so enjoyable it allows you to forget all of your body image issues here you are exhausted worried that you're overweight worried that your brain is moving slow and disappears it's a pill to make it go away right why bother it's bliss samadhi and so then we get into trouble right we use for a while in rue's case she has an overdose that's a medical emergency that she possibly could have died from and then parents get freaked out and understandably so right because they're parents and they love you so what do we do you've got a diagnosis you're an addict there's treatment for it let's not judge let's give you treatment and so they send you to rehab and oh chat could i talk about rehab so here's the thing about rehab man where do i even begin okay let's talk about rehab so rehab is fantastic in some ways and awful in others so the first thing is that if we look at some of the rehab traditions what happened is there were people who were addicted to substances and they leaned into oftentimes nowadays christian ideology and they found that that christian ideology was very very helpful and it was for a lot of good reasons so i'll give you guys just some example of some of the ideology behind alcoholics anonymous that i think is very kind of like scientifically validated so it's kind of weird because if you look at alcoholics anonymous what they'll start with is that i'm powerless in the face of my addiction and that there's a higher power and only through the grace of that higher power can i overcome this addiction and that sounds kind of like weird right so like if you're admitting powerlessness how is that a winning move when it comes to addiction and it's interesting because it absolutely is and this is where the yogis have been talking about this for a long time as well surrender this the power of surrender and so the tricky thing about an addiction is that an addiction hijacks your power right like that's how the addiction thrives the addiction tells you don't worry about it we got this we can handle it you'll be okay they won't find out you'll be able to handle it you'll be able to handle it it'll tell you whatever you need to do to get to that next hit right it says don't worry about it i have things under control i'm in control sure i got a dui but i just won't let that happen again it's fine if i continue drinking as long as i don't get another dui got another dui oh yeah i slipped there were like some you know mitigate there was some circumstances there wasn't really my fault uber's from now on and you'll even adjust a little bit right that's how you become a functional alcoholic as you adjust and you adjust and you adjust the one thing that you're not going to give up you'll adjust all these different dimensions of your life except for the alcohol that's got to stay because you're in control and if we look at where a lot of addiction gets out of control it's from this fundamental idea that i am in control because as long as you're in control you can keep doing it right because you're in control like it's okay and so aa stumbled upon this or discovered this you know whatever and they sort of start with these things like the alcohol is going to win any any combat we engage in and that's actually incredibly powerful so they discovered like some of these things and they sort of leaned into religiosity and like they developed you know aaa and so that's what the rehabs are like they're they tend to and they develop these systems right and so there's a lot of religiosity to it are there are the steps and the coins and this can be really powerful stuff don't get me wrong but the tricky thing here is that you can like and then rehab becomes a treatment right so people do studies and stuff and as we do studies on rehab we realize okay this is how you fix an addiction this is the best evidence based people will go there you're going to be sober for 30 days you're going to get clean it'll turn your life around because some people that leave sing the praises right they say oh my god it worked so well for me it'll turn your life around it fixed my kid and so you're a parent and you're terrified that your child almost died so you'll pay whatever you drop 50 grand for one month of treatment and you send your kid there but this is the this is the same problem as before it's the same problem as you know like this where now it's like there's another problem that shows up let's ship our kid off to rehab outsource the addiction treatment they'll fix my child at rehab my child will come back and everything will be fine but here's the problem with rehab it's going the wrong way what you want when you go there is really important so i've seen this unfortunately time and time and time again where people come to rehab but do they want to get clean half the reason that people come to rehab is not because they want to get clean it's because someone is making them get clean and so here's the trickiest thing about rehab is you can participate 100 and you can be completely sober at the end of it or you can be a complete addict at the end of it you can go through all of the motions of rehab and not be rehabbed one iota you all get that this is the problem with rehabs in addiction treatment in general is you can show up to every meeting you can talk about your feelings you can hold hands with other people and say and chant god grant me the serenity to accept the things that i cannot change and in your [ __ ] mind not buying one bit of it and no one will ever know the only person that will know is you this is the problem with rehab can it be helpful absolutely is it an evidence-based intervention that helps people with addictions absolutely have i worked at rehabs where i have helped people make substantial and transformative changes to their life absolutely and i've worked at rehabs where i've seen people who walk i mean talk to talk but aren't going to walk the walk because on the inside is where it matters and if you actually when you say this prayer there are two ways to say this prayer right god grant me the serenity to accept the things i cannot change you can say it as words and in your mind be thinking about whatever you want to or you can actually like think about it and recognize that when i use a substance it is because it is intolerable for me to not use it and that if i can accept that intolerability then i have a pathway to sobriety it's simple i cannot tolerate this and the problem with the drug the problem with the [ __ ] drug is that the drug makes you need to never learn how to tolerate you don't need to tolerate it because if you take the medicine if you take the drug you don't need tolerance anymore because it puts you in this state it puts you into a state of samadhi and so you say this prayer because they're like they just like toss this stuff out at you right because even in these rehabs they're like they're like factories you get oh we've got 14 newbies today go get checked in over here they're you know room checks every two days thursday is lasagna night you'll get your one day chip your one week chip in your 30 month chip and then they have graduations and all these other kinds of like ceremonies and things like that which matter to some people and don't matter to other people and so it's like this script but like in a script is not a substitute for a map or a compass a script is not a substitute for anyone capable of giving one iota of good advice but this is what's happened is we become scripted and so you go and you go through the motions right and then like are you are you better off after who knows who knows this is a problem with rehabs the other subtle problem i mean rehabs are great in general just to be clear we're sort of talking about the downsides which remember that has a lot to do with her right it's not so much that the rehab doesn't work the downside though is that there are some rehabs whose business model is to not work so i've seen this unfortunately in some very upscale very expensive rehabs that cater to executives but their business model is like you're going to come to this beautiful place like on an island off the coast of florida or something like some beautiful area of california like in napa valley and we're going to like you're going to get sober we're going to do this like spiritual kind of like talking about stuff you're going to talk about your feelings you see a therapist you're going to do an infrared sauna and you're going to do this and you're going to get massages and you're gonna do yoga you're gonna learn how to meditate and by the way we're gonna like artificially restrict your substances you don't actually have to really do work but it's gonna be like basically a 30-day vacation that you feel fantastic afterward and then we're gonna have very poor aftercare and we're going to send you back into the environment where you have access to alcohol and you're just going to screw up again and when you screw up you had such a positive experience here that you'll come back and we get repeat business and by the way here's your loyalty rewards program 10 visits your 11th is free these kinds of places exist it's unfortunate but their their business model survives off of repeat customers right i don't know how intentional it is because like they'll collect data sort of right so very few rehabs i very very few rehabs will advertise what their success rate is like two years out or three years out they won't even collect it like no one knows it's sad but unfortunately it's true and here it is right what you think because i went to rehab i stayed clean i mean ain't that the point well the whole world's coming to an end and i haven't even graduated high school yet right so here it all comes together this is the thing about addictions is that it's an integration of everything it's an integration of all the above it's an integration of like the world going to hell outsourcing various things pieces of your life that are being handled by this person versus that person that person versus that person and you can choose to participate or not participate you just go there you sit with a therapist you talk about your feelings for an hour you leave and you go and you get high you go to rehab you get your chip you say the words you go and you get high and so now what we're gonna so now we're gonna do is dive into a little bit about drug addiction and what to do about handling addictions okay so let's start with like the different dimensions of addiction so the first thing is we now know that addiction is like genetic in nature so we know that there's inheritance with vulnerability to drug addictions so we know that for example depending on how your brain is wired if you use alcohol your brain will look like this and if you use marijuana it won't look anything like this it'll just be like normal so we know that there are genetic predispos predispositions to particular substances of addiction this is why people have a drug of choice quote unquote right and they'll use a substance once in their life and they'll be like oh my god it transformed my life it revolutionized everything for me and so you know this is just the way that our brain is wired and some of this is inherited but it's actually more than just genetics it's more than just neuroscience it's also parents right so what is the scenario if you guys have seen the show so here's a mom who's having you know a little bit too much wine at dinner so how are we taught to handle things by our parents right so how does this mom handle her emotions she just drinks what are the lessons that we're we're taught by our upbringing so you know is drinking normal is it okay is it not okay like when you have conflict when mom and dad get into a fight and mom sighs and walks out of the room and opens a bottle of wine and dad yells at her and calls her a drunk and she flips him the bird and goes out to the patio and that dad goes to his like garage and mom goes outside and she's just drinking and like what are you being taught by your parents about substance use what are you being taught about if things are intolerable right if you don't have the ability to accept things that you don't change what do you do instead so a lot of that stuff comes from parents and it's not just genetics it's about programming so it's not just nature it's also nurture and then so we're sort of given this kind of setup right this is the hand of cards were dealt and then what happens is personal anxieties come in so like i have a predisposition to alcohol i've been taught that alcohol is a good way to manage my emotions and then i'm a 13 year old kid who just has like anxiety about my body because you know that's a thing by the way i don't know if you guys have heard of platforms like instagram and other forms of social media in which they propagate pictures of very very attractive people and you have 13 year old boys and girls who are looking at these things and they start to become uncomfortable with their body image and so when you look in the mirror right this is the friggin mirror normally what kind of emotions is that supposed to bring up like you're just supposed to see yourself right i'm supposed to look in the mirror to see if there's stuff of the spinach stuck in my teeth but now when i look in the mirror like i gotta make sure i'm slim i gotta make sure i'm trim that's what we have to do and now these emotions start coming up they're exacerbated by technology they're exacerbated by peer pressure and then we turn to our coping mechanisms how do we handle these kinds of things right and then we go to our genetic vulnerability and then there's drugs and so now we kind of go back to this point about designer drugs because what's happening now is like things are getting worse because now you have so many different things are you going to use dmt are you going to use mdma are you going to use you know a variant of dmt so that's like i don't know if you guys remember that scene but the kid is like here i've got like three different things that are three different variants of the same drug all different kinds of dimethyltryptine dmt tryptamine and so which one works for you is it indica blend is it sativa blend is it thc heavy is it cbd heavy is it k2 is it pcp is it meth is it nicotine is it vaping right there's so many different answers that we've got and now what's happened is we have all these vulnerabilities and we have the perfect substance the thing that buries your anxiety the most the thing that makes your drug your brain light up the most right so 5-meo dipt and that's just the way that we're wired and the problem is that like we're given like answers right we're given drugs we're given rehab the problem is that the answers just don't answer things well enough like i can start you on medication i can even send you to rehab but does it fix this does it fix this does it fix this no never mind like all the other stuff that it doesn't fix like climate change and existential dread and like you know we also learned later that rue's dad apparently died of cancer or something like that because the truth is that the world is going to hell and i do have anxiety and i don't feel confident in myself and i don't know what to do about it because i have no one to guide me and so as we we deal with all these things like what do we turn to right we go back to this and all we want to do is go back to this happiness and contentment so how do you deal with this stuff right how do you get back here in a sense and i think that this is where as an addiction psychiatrist like you can absolutely get here but i think it's integrated i think it's not it's not you can't outsource it that's the biggest thing should you get sober like absolutely don't get me wrong don't use drugs kids seriously but the thing is like not using drugs and getting sober is not you can't outsource it right you can't just like go to rehab once and that's going to be the end of it this is where you really have to integrate everything you have to understand first of all appreciate the genetics appreciate that like your brain is particularly vulnerable to a certain substance second thing is like develop healthy coping mechanisms that goes back to the mom who's drinking because here's the thing we were taught when things are intolerable you were taught how to how to deal with them which is through substances and so it's about developing things like a meditative practice grounding practices learning how to urge surf all these other kinds of of topics how do you manage your emotions you must become adapt at managing your emotions tolerating your emotions because that's what that's what the drugs do right they give you a pass at dealing with your life next up is actually how can i say this reducing the power of the emotions to begin with and this is where a lot of people who struggle with addiction like kind of fall short is they're like okay i need to learn alternate coping mechanisms like i need to learn how to meditate but meditation can only get you so far when it when it comes to dealing with some of the like how hard life is this is also where like therapy can come in in really powerfully because here's the thing if i have a pile of emotion that i have to cope with so i need like this amount of meditation skill that may be too much the drug can get me here this is the crap i have to deal with you can actually reduce the crap that you have to deal with through things like therapy but the whole point is that therapy is not going to be enough right when you kind of dig down and like recognize that it was incredibly traumatic when your parents like how terrified you were that when they first took you to the psychiatrist and they said oh sweetie nothing's wrong don't worry you're gonna be okay and they had tears in their eyes and you're like what the hell is going on like i don't understand anything but i know that whatever it is it's bad and then your parents are like no honey don't worry everything is gonna be okay and that's the moment it in which reassurance no longer worked for you and then you stopped trusting people reassuring you and if you think about if i can no longer be reassured by other human beings what does that do for my anxiety because now i can't be reassured so i'm just screwed constantly and then the only thing that works is drugs because i'm not able to be reassured why am i not able to be reassured because i had a traumatic experience where my parents were reassuring me nothing is wrong and then i started to distrust reassurance you guys get that i'm just kind of tossing that out there but i've seen it right so like once you start to distrust reassurance like the world becomes a terrifying place because if you ever get anxious there's nothing that can make that anxiety go away and so as you work with a therapist hopefully a good therapist who can help you realize that then it's like oh my god i need to practice i need to learn how to be reassured again you work on that and then suddenly you're able to be reassured which means when you're feeling like this and a friend comes and says hey let me help you that they can actually bring it down and now you can meditate enough right so it all has to come together you have to work through the crap that you've built up psychologically through all of your micro traumas and whatnot but that's not gonna be enough you're also gonna have to learn how to meditate you're gonna have to learn alternate coping mechanisms you're gonna have to also have insight and understanding into how your parents taught you to deal with emotions so in sanskrit we call those kinds of things some scars right these are like the lessons that your mind learn through sub-optimal emotional processing they're the psychological scars that are left with you through negative experiences and then you carry those scars with you we understand this stuff really well because we call it like relationship baggage right like oh yeah like why didn't that relationship work out oh like that dude just had way too much baggage we carry stuff with us that's unprocessed and affects the present so you've got to go through and clean that crap out and by all means engage in treatment right there may be a role for medication like here i am sort of talking about the downsides of medication and stuff like that because it does like zone people out but this is where like if you have a good clinician and this is where i sort of hate the direction that psychiatric treatment is going because we've started to separate out like psychopharmacology from psychotherapy so as medicine is becoming more and more specialized i've got my prescriber and i've got my therapist and then i've got my group therapist and then i have my yoga teacher and then i have my meditation app like as human beings we're having to assemble all of that but the truth is that if if all of that is housed in one mind it helps the patient so much which is precisely why i like doing everything like as a clinician it's like we're doing the patient a disservice i'm just prescribing medication and then i'm supposed to have a conversation with their therapist once every two months to try to get the low down like that works coordination of care is important but like ideally like one person is going to be able to do it all one person is going to teach you meditation one person is going to pick your their meditation based on what traumas you've had and they're also going to figure out okay i'm going to start this medication we're going to teach you this meditation and then in eight weeks hopefully the meditation is going to work and i'm going to know ahead of time that we're going to try to cut down on the medication and for the next eight weeks i recognize that you feel like a zombie but i really think you need the medication and this is why we're doing the meditation so that we can cut down on the medication in eight weeks but i need you to take it every single day and i recognize it sucks and you can't create art and it all needs to be put together and the most important thing is to build a life that is worth living so here's the thing that i think is like missing most fundamentally from addiction treatment is that when the value of forgetting is more than the value of remembering someone will reach for a dog a drug the true antidote to addiction is to want to be in the world right it's when like forgetting the world in oblivion is not as good as being awake and alive doug that's the honest to god's truth and this is the reason why we like focused on like creating a something like a coaching program here at hc is because like the problem is that like like rue said no one gives you a map for like what to do in life and so like therapists are really good at like dealing with trauma and stuff but i know that therapists are great at like helping you work on your resume right because that's not what we're trained in but at the end of the day like the sacrifice of the drug the reason that people get addicted to drugs is because the benefit that they get from the drug outweighs the cost at the end of the day very simple and so what you have to do if you really want to stay sober is build a life that is worth living build a life that you don't want to forget and that's hard and the problem is that like we don't even have a formal way of doing that right it's all this autopilot crap that's gotten hijacked it's like go to college they stopped teaching a lot of stuff at college a long time ago it stopped being about education and they still teach a lot but the college has stopped being about education universities stopped being about education think about the incentives of the people at your university who are your professors how much formal training in teaching do your professors have think about that right like i teach at harvard medical school but i'm not a trained educator thankfully my program was really emphasized that so i feel lucky but it's not like i have a masters in education and so you have people teaching biochemistry who like are not great teachers some of them are some of them like it and some are forced to do it so all of our incentives are messed up and the problem is like you're the one who pays the price you're the one who pays the price of 911 you're the one who pays the price of the 2008 economic crisis you're the one who pays the price of the genetics that you were born with you're the one who pays the price of the parenting emotional style that you were raised with you're the one who pays the price of living in 2022 when there are like 15 kinds of designer drugs so you're literally your tendency to be addicted is at an all-time high because you have so many frigging options out there and they've been purified and refined if you think about vaping people have recently seen studies that show that vapes are more addictive than cigarettes oh who is surprised not i the amount of nicotine and stimulant in the vape is actually at a higher dose than cigarettes why do you think they did that it's to get people to smoke vapes the deck is stacked against you in so many different ways and the challenge here is that you have so many answers right go to therapy go to rehab start medication see a psychiatrist go to alcoholics anonymous do all these different things watch dr k you'll change your life but none of that is going to be enough i'm not saying it isn't helpful it's great we're great too by the way like i believe in all of those things but the problem is that that's not enough right the basic problem with addiction is that you can't just go through the motions that's what's so devastating about being a parent with a child with an addiction is you can send them to rehab and you can see them go through the motions but in the back of your mind as a parent you never know what is going on in that child's head right you never know and that's ultimately what it comes down to if you're a parent with a child with addiction you understand this that ultimately it's what's going on in their head it's not what they show it's not what they tell it's not how they act it's not what they say it's none of that it's what's going on in their head are they actually committed to sobriety or not and in terms of getting sober that's the only thing that matters or it's not the only thing that matters incorrect the thing that matters the most you can't be a passive recipient of the rest of it and so i love euphoria because i think it does such a good job in 20 minutes to explain all of this stuff from how the world that we're brought into to how we get diagnosed how we get piled with diagnoses how we get piled with medications how that makes it hard for us to function how we have all these anxieties about our like body image and all this kind of crap and why we start using and what happens when we go to rehab and what doesn't happen when we go to rehab and why addiction is so devastating because it's like can you really blame someone if like what the addiction does is take away all their problems that's just the first 20 minutes we've got a lot more i mean not today but in general so check out the show it's worth watching if you have if you know someone who struggles with addiction i think it's pretty insightful if you yourself struggle with addiction i think it's pretty insightful i think it's like a really good compliment to like all the other stuff right so by all means go see a therapist go to rehab and then watch the show did you like the rest as well i haven't finished it so [Music] i was taking notes during watching euphoria in my notes for the first 20 minutes or 10 pages long so we're gonna we have so much dude do you guys want to hear about like maybe we can vote or something i don't know it's a mistake but so there's a lot of good stuff uh okay so uh there's a correction so ayahuasca dmt is technically south american not native american mostly in amazonian cultures but not limited to peyote mescaline is the native american equivalent and is limited historically to tribes in what we call now mexico and texas thank you for correcting us um apologies for that misattribution questions yes someone's saying a friend who's an addict once told me she felt that felt people that did uppers still had to want to live while those who did downers like she does don't want to live anymore yeah so here's the thing there's a lot of wisdom to come out of addiction a lot of wisdom i don't know if that's true for all people but is becoming a psychiatrist still worth it if i want to actually help people personally 100 i love being a psychiatrist dr k do you think parenting style you mentioned in the start could have caused me to have obsessive thoughts and health anxiety not diagnosed sort of so that's where like so the point i'm trying to make is that when it comes to you as a person you can't fix any particular thing with just one dimensional treatment and not one of these things causes who you are right so it's like there's a genetic component there's an upbringing component there's a world is going to hell component so your health anxiety or obsessive thoughts could they've been influenced by your parents certainly but that's where like if you haven't been diagnosed i would go talk to someone about that right so get an expert opinion and help figure out where does this where does this part of me come from because that's important to understand so i'm seeing an unusual amount of personal questions how do you get out of reasoning addiction oh wait hold on i don't know what quite what that means are you addicted to reasoning or i don't know what that means but here's what i'd say like so some people get stuck in reasoning for sure right and like if you're if you're someone who just gets stuck in logic and doesn't act there's a simple reason for that it's because logic is a safe space right like the realm of logic is a hypothetical it's it's you know you can fantasize about relationships as much as you want to and you're never going to get hurt it's when you actually engage in a relationship that stuff is out of your control and so a lot of people will like tunnel down into logic and just rely on logic how are you so mentally stable after seeing so many dark things it's a good question so first of all there's an assumption that i'm mentally stable which you know time will tell the second thing is that i think this is where we have an assumption that darkness that things are dark and that darkness is bad whereas like my experience of seeing darkness is like that's actually when you see real strength and real wisdom and like so people think that it's you know it's bad like how can i sit with people like day after day and like listen to their trauma and stuff it's because it's out of that strength that they become the people that they are right which can be like amazing beautiful powerful things and so it's it's not like you just take the darkness on that's what happens and the cool thing is like i mean i don't know how to say this but it's it's inspiring to see someone come out of that and like the devastation of hearing about someone's trauma is outweighed by watching them overcome it right and so like i get to see those wins too and that's why i do this work it's because like there are wins to be had like this is a fight that can be won can you be addicted to dr k i i don't i wouldn't use the word addiction but i think that there are a lot of people out there who spend a lot of time thinking about making change instead of actually making change so there it's interesting because because i i mean i think that we can become you can procrastinate on dr k just like you can on anything else and you got to be a little bit careful because just because you may be learning something here i'm not saying that it's hopefully this is less damaging procrastination in terms of you're getting some benefit from watching us but at the end of the day like don't stop living your life because you spent too much time listening to dr k right like that we can be we can be a part of the problem too 100 so if you're using listening to dr k as a substitute for doing something in your life then that's a problem how do you learn to accept being unable to tolerate like so that's the first thing is you recognize that you're not able to tolerate right and that's got to be okay and then the other thing that's really wild is that people who don't believe they can tolerate a big part of that is the assumption that the suffering will go on forever so it's not that you can't survive this second it's that you can't survive the next five minutes and the next 10 minutes in the next hour so when a human being is suffering we think the duration of that suffering is forever and especially when we start to use drugs something weird happens in the mind where when we get instant relief i wish i could explain this well this may sound this may not make any sense but the more instant my relief is the longer my suffering feels does that make sense it's like for normal people it's like here's the duration of suffering here's how long it takes to get better and those things kind of match and then as i shrink the amount of time it takes to get better the window of suffering like increases by a proportionate amount i don't know if that makes sense or not but it's kind of weird but like and we sort of know this because if you look at different kinds of benzodiazepine drugs the drugs that have the prescribed drugs that have the fastest onset of action are the ones that are the most addictive so this is why like xanax is so damn addictive because its onset of action is very fast whereas you can take a medication like clonazepam which has a slower onset of action can still be abused but it's generally speaking less addictive and so something weird happens that as long as you think that your suffering is forever that's what makes it intolerable and so the key thing about learning to tolerate your suffering is that it's intolerable it's intolerable it's intolerable but i'm not gonna act in this moment i'm not gonna act in this moment it's intolerable i'm not gonna act in this moment and then something magical will happen which is that at some point you'll realize that like the suffering will go away on its own because that's how the human mind works right so imagine you know some kind of resentment that you had from a birthday party in high school that resentment can sort of stay with you in some level but it's not like the suffering of that moment lingers for the rest of your life at that intensity the flip side is also true the joy of the birthday party doesn't linger for the rest of your life so i'll talk to people who are really obsessed about their weddings like sometimes i'll get like marital conflict about weddings i mean it's not marital it's pre-marital like oh my god i want this wedding and it needs to be this way this way this way and the other person's like no like we don't need that we don't we talk about a little bit it's like how long does the happiness of the wedding last right you want this perfect day this day of perfect happiness how long do you get to hold on to that day of perfect happiness how long can you hold on to the resentment of not having a perfect day of happiness that can last a lifetime 100 resentment can last forever but the happiness never does you
